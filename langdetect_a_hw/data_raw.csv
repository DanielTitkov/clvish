0,"James Masterson (September 18, 1855 – March 31, 1895), also known as Jim Masterson, was a lawman of the American West and the youngest brother of gunfighters and lawmen Bat Masterson and Ed Masterson.


== Early life ==
After working on the western frontier as a buffalo hunter with his brothers, he returned to Kansas. He and Ben Springer were the co-owners of the successful Lady Gay Dance Hall and Saloon in Dodge City, which employed the popular singer Dora Hand.


== Career ==
Masterson became the assistant marshal in Dodge City in June 1878. At that time Charlie Bassett was the Marshal, having replaced Jim's brother Ed, who was killed in the line of duty two months earlier. Wyatt Earp was a Deputy Marshal under Bassett at that same time, along with Earp's brother James. In the summer of 1878, a cowboy named George Hoy opened fire on the Comique Variety Hall, outside of which stood Masterson and Wyatt Earp. Earp had been involved in an altercation with Hoy previously. Both Earp and Masterson returned fire, and Hoy was shot from his horse by one bullet that severely injured his arm. Hoy died a month later, and Earp always claimed to have fired the shot that ultimately killed Hoy. However, that was never confirmed, and it is entirely possible that the shot was actually fired by Jim Masterson. Masterson, however, never disputed Earp's claim, and simply didn't comment.
He made several hundred arrests during the next two year time span, mostly of drunken cowboys who came through Dodge City on cattle drives. In November, 1879, he was promoted to Marshal after Bassett's resignation. He shot at least one man during his service with the Dodge City Marshal's Office, aside from the Hoy shooting. On April 6, 1881, he lost his job after a change in city government, and the belief that the long-standing hard-lined stance of the Marshal's Office was past its prime and no longer useful.
He fell out with his business partner, A.J. Peacock, over the hiring of the latter's brother-in-law, Al Updegraph, as bartender, and someone wired Bat Masterson in Tombstone that his brother's life was in danger. Bat arrived in Dodge on 16 April and saw Peacock and Updegraph near the station. Firing broke out, with Jim and others also taking part. Updegraph was the only casualty, taking a bullet through the lungs. Bat was fined for discharging a gun within the city limits and the brothers left Dodge.
Masterson moved to Trinidad, Colorado, where he joined the police force. While in Trinidad, Masterson arrested John Allen for the shooting death of Frank Loving, in what became known as the Trinidad Gunfight. In 1885 he became an under sheriff in Colfax County, New Mexico. In 1889, he took an active part in the Gray County War in Kansas. He was one of a group of lawmen who made a raid on the courthouse at Cimarron, which resulted in a famous gunfight known as the Battle of Cimarron.
He later moved to Guthrie, Oklahoma, and then later became a Deputy Sheriff of Logan County, Oklahoma. On September 1, 1893, as a Special Deputy U. S. Marshall, he was involved in the Battle of Ingalls, a gunfight in Ingalls, Oklahoma against the Doolin-Dalton gang, and was responsible for the capture of gang member ""Arkansas Tom"" Jones.


== Death ==
He died in Guthrie of tuberculosis on March 31, 1895, aged 39.

2,"Klax is a 1989 puzzle video game designed by Dave Akers and Mark Stephen Pierce. The object is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear, to which the object of Columns is similar. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, about which they were tangled in a legal dispute at the time.


== Gameplay ==
Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5X5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a ""drop"". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any colour. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a ""Klax."" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as does Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points).
Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Levels 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and a higher drop allowance. The game ends when the player either exhausts their drop allowance, fills up their playing area, or finishes level 100.


== Development ==
Akers programmed Klax in just a few weeks using AmigaBASIC, then ported it line-by-line to C. In a 1990 interview, he said he wanted to ""produce something playable, compact and relatively quick to develop."" His influences were both Tetris and tic-tac-toe. He chose the name from the sound tiles make rolling across the screen. Atari Games released Klax in February 1990, and soon called it a ""major arcade hit"". They quickly released several home versions under the Tengen brand. Akers created the Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis editions himself. Some 16-bit conversions featured improved graphics. Klax received the Parents' Choice Foundation's seal of approval in 1990, won Best Mind Game at the 1991 European Computer Leisure Awards, and Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune named it the Best Cartridge of 1990.
Midway Games gained the rights to Klax upon purchasing Atari Games in 1996. The title has been re-released in retro compilations for modern consoles. A 1999 press release called it Midway's ""tic-tac tile puzzle game."" Mike Mika, who was working on the Game Boy Color version of the game, placed a hidden wedding proposal inside it. It took his then girlfriend three years to uncover the proposal. Mike Mika also placed a hidden Snake-like game as well as a mini adventure game within the game as easter eggs.
After the arcade version, Klax saw ports to most contemporary home computers and video game systems of the 1990s, including the Atari 2600, Atari Lynx, and Amstrad GX4000. Klax was the first game with versions for all three of the 1990s' leading consoles: the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Genesis and the TurboGrafx-16. Klax was included in Arcade Party Pak for the PlayStation. The game was also reissued in Midway Arcade Treasures, a 2003 compilation for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC. It also appeared in Lego Dimensions.


== Reception ==
On release, Famicom Tsūshin awarded the PC Engine version of the game a 30 out of 40. The game was ranked the 26th best game of all time by Amiga Power.

3,"Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on the Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It was the second animated feature film produced by Disney, made after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).
The plot of the film involves an old wood-carver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio. The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy, who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves himself to be ""brave, truthful, and unselfish"". Pinocchio's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters. The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia, William Cottrell, Otto Englander, Erdman Penner, Joseph Sabo, Ted Sears, and Webb Smith from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts. Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water. The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7, 1940.
Critical analysis of Pinocchio identifies it as a simple morality tale that teaches children of the benefits of hard work and middle-class values. Although it became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award – winning two for Best Music, Original Score and for Best Music, Original Song for ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" – it was initially a box office disaster. It eventually made a profit in its 1945 reissue, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made, with a rare 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture, featuring at various Disney parks and in other forms of entertainment. In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".


== Plot ==
Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.

Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.
Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them money if they can find naughty little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.
Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.


== Cast ==
Dickie Jones as Pinocchio, a wooden puppet carved by Geppetto, and turned into a living puppet by the Blue Fairy.
Jones also provided the voice of Alexander, a boy transformed into a donkey.

Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket, a cheerful and wise cricket, who acts as Pinocchio's ""conscience"", and the partial narrator of the story.
Christian Rub as Mister Geppetto, a kind and elderly woodcarver, who creates Pinocchio, and wishes for him to become a real boy.
Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish are Geppetto's pets. Figaro is a spoiled cat who is prone to jealousy. Cleo is a flirty little goldfish with a habit of being Figaro's counselor.

Walter Catlett as ""Honest"" John Worthington Foulfellow, a sly anthropomorphic red fox, and the main antagonist of the film, who tricks Pinocchio twice in the film.
Gideon the Cat, Honest John's mute, crafty, and anthropomorphic feline sidekick. He was originally intended to be voiced by Mel Blanc of Looney Tunes fame (in his second work for Disney until his final work in Who Framed Roger Rabbit), but the filmmakers removed his dialogue from the script in favor of a mute performance (e.g. Harpo Marx) just like Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, Gideon's hiccups were provided by Blanc.

He speaks with an Italian accent, and curses in Italian when he gets angry, though he is identified as a gypsy. He is the only antagonist of the film to be part of the official Disney Villains line-up.
Judels also voiced the devious and sadistic Coachman, owner and operator of Pleasure Island, who enjoys turning unruly boys into donkeys.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
In September 1937, during the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, animator Norman Ferguson brought a translated version of Carlo Collodi's 1883 Italian children's novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio to the attention of Walt Disney. After reading the book ""Walt was busting his guts with enthusiasm"" as Ferguson later recalled. Pinocchio was intended to be the studio's third film, after Bambi. However, due to difficulties with Bambi (adapting the story and animating the animals realistically), it was put on hold and Pinocchio was moved ahead in production.


=== Writing and design ===
Unlike Snow White, which was a short story that the writers could expand and experiment with, Pinocchio was based on a novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed in the early stages of animation.

Early scenes animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly like that of a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were ""rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet"" and felt that they should ""forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards"". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.
However, Disney found that the new Pinocchio was too helpless and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, in the summer of 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a ""Soup Eating Sequence"" in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. ""The only thing that makes him a cricket is because we call him one,"" Kimball later joked.


=== Casting ===

Due to the huge success of Snow White, Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio, which marked the first time an animated film had used celebrities as voice actors. He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards, also known as ""Ukelele Ike"", as Jiminy Cricket. Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 12-year-old child actor Dickie Jones, who had previously been in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick, Walter Catlett as Foulfellow the Fox, Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman, and Christian Rub as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub.
Another voice actor recruited was Mel Blanc, best remembered for voicing many of the characters in Warner Bros. cartoon shorts. Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.


=== Animation ===

Animation began in September 1938. During the production of the film, the character model department was headed by Joe Grant, whose department was responsible for the building of three-dimensional clay models of the characters in the film, known as maquettes. These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists. The model makers also built working models of Geppetto's cuckoo clocks, as well as Stromboli's gypsy wagon and the Coachman's carriage. However, owing to the difficulty animating a realistic moving vehicle, the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation. Then each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox. The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the rostrum camera. Like Snow White, live-action footage was shot for Pinocchio with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime, supervised by Hamilton Luske. Rather than tracing, which would result in stiff unnatural movement, the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation (though slightly exaggerated).
Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation. In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters, effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters. This includes vehicles, machinery and natural effects such as rain, lightning, snow, smoke, shadows and water, as well as the fantasy or science-fiction type effects like Fairy Dust. The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who mainly worked on Fantasia contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy's wand. Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year-long animation of the water effects, which included splashes, ripples, bubbles, waves and the illusion of being underwater. To help give depth to the ocean, the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground, and put in less detail as the surface moved further back. After the animation was traced onto cels, the animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look. To save time and money, the splashes were kept impressionistic. These techniques enabled Pinocchio to be one of the first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation. Ollie Johnston remarked ""I think that's one of the finest things the studio's ever done, as Frank [Thomas] said, 'The water looks so real a person can drown in it, and they do.'""


== Soundtrack ==

The songs in Pinocchio were composed by Leigh Harline with lyrics by Ned Washington. Leigh Harline and Paul J. Smith composed the incidental music score. The soundtrack was first released on February 9, 1940. Jiminy Cricket's song, ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", became a major hit and is still identified with the film, and later as the theme song of The Walt Disney Company itself. The soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Original Score.


== Themes ==

M. Keith Booker considers the film to be the most-down-to-earth of the classic Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic, and notes that the film's protagonist has to work to prove his worth, which he remarked seemed ""more in line with the ethos of capitalism"" than most of the Disney films. Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like Pinocchio and Bambi (1942) were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls. Mark I. Pinksy said that it is ""a simple morality tale — cautionary and schematic — ideal for moral instruction, save for some of its darker moments"", and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children.
Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is ""an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing"" and that the film is ""ultimately an assimilationist fable"". He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class, intended to relay the message that indulging in ""the pleasures of the working class, of vaudeville, or of pool halls and amusement parks, led to a life as a beast of burden"". For Sammond, the purpose of Pinocchio is to help convey to children the ""middle-class virtues of deferred gratification, self-denial, thrift, and perseverance, naturalized as the experience of the most average American"".


== Reception ==


=== Initial release ===

Pinocchio went into release accompanied by generally positive reviews. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times gave the film five out of five stars, saying ""Pinocchio is here at last, is every bit as fine as we had prayed it would be—if not finer—and that it is as gay and clever and delightful a fantasy as any well-behaved youngster or jaded oldster could hope to see."" Time gave the film a positive review, saying ""In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard Snow White set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself."" The film won the Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, the first Disney film to win either.
Initially, Pinocchio was not a box-office success. The box office returns from the film's initial release were both below Snow White's unprecedented success and below studio expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million negative cost – twice the cost of Snow White – Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that Pinocchio returned rentals of less than one million by September 1940, and in its first public annual report, Walt Disney Productions charged off a $1 million loss to the film. Barrier relays that a 1947 Pinocchio balance sheet listed total receipts to the studio of $1,423,046.78. This was primarily due to the fact that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European and Asian markets overseas, and hindered the international success of Pinocchio and other Disney releases during the early and mid-1940s. Joe Grant recalled Walt Disney being ""very, very depressed"" about Pinocchio's initial returns at the box office. RKO recorded a loss of $94,000 for the film.


=== Modern acclaim ===
Many film historians consider this to be the film that most closely approaches technical perfection of all the Disney animated features. Film critic Leonard Maltin said, ""with Pinocchio, Disney reached not only the height of his powers, but the apex of what many critics consider to be the realm of the animated cartoon."" Despite its initial struggles at the box office, a series of reissues in the years after World War II proved more successful, and allowed the film to turn a profit. By 1973, the film had earned $13 million from the initial 1940 release and four reissues; further reissues in subsequent years have brought Pinocchio's lifetime gross to $84,254,167 at the box office.
In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Filmmaker Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time in a 2001 article written for The Guardian and in 2005, Time named it one of the 100 best films of the last 80 years, and then in June 2011 named it the best animated movie of ""The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films"".
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its ""Ten top Ten""—the best ten films in ten ""classic"" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Pinocchio was acknowledged as the second best film in the animation genre, after Snow White. It was nominated for the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, and received further nominations for their Thrills and Heroes and Villains (Stromboli) lists. The song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" ranked number 7 on their 100 Songs list, and the film ranked 38th in the 100 Cheers list. The quote ""A lie keeps growing and growing until it's as plain as the nose on your face"" was nominated for the Movie Quotes list, and the film received further nomination in the AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals list.
On Rotten Tomatoes, a website which aggregates film reviews, the film has the website's highest rating of 100%, meaning every single one of the 45 reviews of the film, from contemporaneous reviews to modern re-appraisals, on the site are positive with an average rating of 9.1 out of 10. The general consensus of the film on the site is ""Ambitious, adventurous, and sometimes frightening, Pinocchio arguably represents the pinnacle of Disney's collected works - it's beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant.""


== Reissues and home media ==
With the re-release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1944 came the tradition of re-releasing Disney films every seven to ten years. Pinocchio was theatrically re-released in 1945, 1954, 1962, 1971, 1978, 1984, and 1992. RKO handled the first two reissues in 1945 and 1954, while Disney itself reissued the film from 1962 on through its Buena Vista Distribution division.
In 1985, it was released on VHS in North America for the first time and on UK VHS in 1988 for the first time. The 1992 re-issue was digitally restored by cleaning and removing scratches from the original negatives one frame at a time, eliminating soundtrack distortions, and revitalizing the color.
The more comprehensive digital restoration that was done for the 1992 re-issue was released on VHS in 1993, followed by its fourth VHS release and first release on Disney DVD in 1999. The second Disney DVD release and final issue in the VHS format premiered as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classics Collection VHS/DVD line on March 7, 2000. The Gold Classic VHS/DVD release returned to the Disney Vault on January 31, 2002.
A special edition VHS and DVD of the film was released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2003. The fourth DVD release and first Blu-ray Disc release (the second Blu-ray in the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series) was released on March 10, 2009. Like the 2008 Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray release, the Pinocchio Blu-ray package featured a new restoration by Lowry Digital in a two-disc Blu-ray set, with a bonus DVD version of the film also included. This set returned to the Disney Vault on April 30, 2011. A Signature Edition was released on Digital HD on January 10, 2017 and was followed by a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on January 31, 2017.


== Legacy ==

In 1987, Filmation released a ""thinly-veiled"" animated sequel to Pinocchio, entitled Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night. Set a year after Pinocchio became a real boy, the movie received mainly negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Disney sued Filmation for copyright infringement, but Filmation won the lawsuit on the grounds that Collodi's work is in the public domain.
Many of Pinocchio's characters are meetable characters at Disney parks. Pinocchio's Daring Journey is a popular ride at the original Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Park in Paris. Pinocchio Village Haus is a quick service restaurant at Walt Disney World that serves pizza and macaroni and cheese. There are similar quick-service restaurants at the Disneyland parks in Anaheim and Paris as well, with almost identical names.
Disney on Ice starring Pinocchio, toured internationally from 1987 to 1992. A shorter version of the story is also presented in the current Disney on Ice production ""One Hundred Years Of Magic"".
Aside from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy, and SNES games based on the animated film, Geppetto and Pinocchio also appear as characters in the game Kingdom Hearts. The inside of Monstro is also featured as one of the worlds. Jiminy Cricket appears as well, acting as a recorder, keeping a journal of the game's progress in Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and, Kingdom Hearts II. Pinocchio's home world was slated to appear in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, but was omitted due to time restrictions, although talk-sprites of Pinocchio, Geppetto, Honest John and Gideon have been revealed. As compensation, this world appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, under the name ""Prankster's Paradise"", with Dream world versions of Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Geppetto, Cleo, Monstro and the Blue Fairy appearing.


== Cancelled sequel ==
In the mid-2000s, DisneyToon Studios began development on a sequel to Pinocchio. Robert Reece co-wrote the film's screenplay, which saw Pinocchio on a ""strange journey"" for the sake of something dear to him. ""It's a story that leads Pinocchio to question why life appears unfair sometimes,"" said Reece. John Lasseter cancelled Pinocchio II soon after being named Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2006.


== Live-action film ==
On April 8, 2015, Deadline reported that Disney is developing a live action film based on the animated Pinocchio, with Peter Hedges penning the script. As of May 2017, Sam Mendes is in talks to direct the movie from Chris Weitz's script. Six months later, it was announced that Mendes would no longer be directing the film.

5,"A hologram bracelet or energy bracelet is a small rubber wristband fitted with a hologram. Manufacturers have said that the holograms ""optimise the natural flow of energy around the body, and so improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility"". Only anecdotal evidence supports these claims and tests performed by the Australian Skeptics, the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, and the RMIT's School of Health Sciences have been unable to identify any effect on performance.


== Products ==

Hologram bracelets include a small hologram which manufacturers say is ""programmed"" through an undisclosed process. Power Balance, who have manufactured the bracelets since 2007, say that the programming ""mimics Eastern philosophies"". The holograms are most usually installed in bracelets and wristbands but are also sold as pendants or necklaces, anklets, shoe inserts, pet tags, or separately for users to apply to the back of a watch, for example.
Manufacturers including Power Balance and EFX Performance make no claims on their websites for their products, but carry testimonials from users who say that they improve athletic performance. Until 2010, Power Balance said that their bracelets helped improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility because the holograms are embedded with an ""electrical frequency"" that restores the body's ""electrical balance"" on contact with its natural energy field. In December 2010, following a successful legal action by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Power Balance admitted that there was no credible scientific evidence for these claims.


== Response ==
Mark Hodgkinson, writing in the Daily Telegraph in 2010, called hologram bracelets a fad with many professional athletes seen wearing them and several actively endorsing them. Footballers David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo have worn them, and tennis players Sam Querrey and Mardy Fish both wore them during the final of the 2010 Queen's Club Championships. Endorsements for the Power Balance bracelet have come from Shaquille O'Neal, Rubens Barrichello, and the London Wasps rugby team, while ice hockey team the Cardiff Devils announced a partnership with Power Balance in early 2010. NASCAR reported in 2011 that many drivers wore EFX Performance bracelets with the Hendrick Motorsports and Stewart-Haas Racing teams entering into licensing deals.
Several groups have investigated the effects of hologram bracelets on athletic performance. A 2011 study by RMIT University's School of Health Sciences found that there was an overall decrease in the balance and stability of wearers, although it was not statistically significant and the overall conclusion was that the bracelets had no effect on performance. The Australian Skeptics group found that the bracelets has no more than a placebo effect.
Research by the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, commissioned by the BBC, also found that wearing the bracelets had no effect on performance in standard sports industry tests, adding that neither the physiology or the biology of wearers was changed. However, Dr Gareth Irwin who carried out the tests said that there may be changes in performance because of the placebo effect, a view which has been echoed by sports psychologists. Sports psychologist Victor Thompson says the bracelets play on superstition, simply giving people the expectation that they can improve their sporting performance. Cricket coach Jeremy Snape said he prefers that athletes have belief in themselves rather than in an external product, while Roberto Forzoni described the bracelets as ""gimmicks"" which allow athletes to avoid addressing real issues in their performance, with the high-profile endorsements giving the sense of belonging to an elite group of athletes.

8,"Jane Marple, usually referred to as Miss Marple, is a fictional character appearing in 12 of Agatha Christie's crime novels and in 20 short stories. Miss Marple is an elderly spinster who lives in the village of St. Mary Mead and acts as an amateur consulting detective. Alongside Hercule Poirot, she is one of the most loved and famous of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first appearance was in a short story published in The Royal Magazine in December 1927, ""The Tuesday Night Club"", which later became the first chapter of The Thirteen Problems (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in The Murder at the Vicarage in 1930.


== Origins ==
The character of Miss Marple is based on Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, née West), and her cronies. Agatha Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was ""the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies – old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl"". Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. When Michael Morton adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.
There is no definitive source for the derivation of the name 'Marple'. The most common explanation is that the name was taken from Marple railway station in Stockport, through which Christie passed. Alternatively, Christie may have taken the name from a family named Marple, who lived at Marple Hall near her sister Madge's home at Abney Hall.


== Character ==
The character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, The Murder at the Vicarage, is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books she becomes more modern and a kinder person.
Miss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with Sir Henry Clithering, a retired commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, for official information when required.
Miss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the ""well-known author"" Raymond West appears in some stories including Sleeping Murder and Ingots of Gold, which also feature his wife Joan, a modern artist (though prior to their marriage she is referred to as ""Joyce Lemprière"", in The Thirteen Problems stories). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating maid, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side, lives in.
Miss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (A Caribbean Mystery, 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as ""genteel""; indeed, a gentlewoman. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the gentleman detective. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In They Do It with Mirrors (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a cathedral close, and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline ""Carrie"" Louise Serrocold.
While Miss Marple is described as 'an old lady' in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in ""At Bertram's Hotel"", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ""Sleeping Murder"", 41 years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in The Murder at the Vicarage, the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in A Caribbean Mystery.
Little is known about Marple's background, except that she has two younger sisters. One of them is the mother of Raymond, and the other is mother to Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (The Thumb Mark of St. Peter).

== Films ==


=== Margaret Rutherford ===
Although popular from her first appearance in 1930, Jane Marple had to wait thirty-two years for her first big-screen appearance, starring Margaret Rutherford. These were popular and successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side to Rutherford.
Rutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).
Murder, She Said (1961, directed by George Pollock) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This first film was based on the 1957 novel 4:50 from Paddington (U.S. title, What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it.
The other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were Murder at the Gallop (1963), based on the 1953 Hercule Poirot novel After the Funeral (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); Murder Most Foul (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel Mrs McGinty's Dead; and Murder Ahoy! (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from They Do It With Mirrors (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to The Mousetrap. Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the spoof Hercule Poirot adventure The Alphabet Murders (1965).
The music to all four films was composed and conducted by Ron Goodwin and is still played on radio today. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations on each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the violin. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from Stanley Black. Black had worked with Pollock on ""Stranger in Town"" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.
Rutherford, who was 70 years old when the first film was made, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, Stringer Davis, appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.


=== Angela Lansbury ===
In 1980, Angela Lansbury played Miss Marple in The Mirror Crack'd (EMI, directed by Guy Hamilton), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Geraldine Chaplin, Tony Curtis, and Kim Novak. Edward Fox appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes.
Lansbury later starred in the TV series Murder, She Wrote as Jessica Fletcher, a mystery novelist who also solves crimes. The character of Jessica Fletcher is thought to be based on a combination of Miss Marple, Agatha Christie herself, and another Christie character, Ariadne Oliver, who often appears in the Hercule Poirot mysteries.


=== Ita Ever ===
In 1983, Estonian stage and film actress Ita Ever starred in the Russian language film adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel A Pocket Full of Rye (using the Russian edition's translated title, The Secret of the Blackbirds) as the character of Miss Marple.


== Television ==
American TV was the setting for the first dramatic portrayal of Miss Marple with Gracie Fields, the legendary British actress, playing her in a 1956 episode of Goodyear TV Playhouse based on A Murder Is Announced, the 1950 Christie novel.
In 1970, the character of Miss Marple was portrayed by Inge Langen in a West German television adaptation of The Murder at the Vicarage (Mord im Pfarrhaus).
In 2015, CBS planned a ""much younger"" version of the character, a granddaughter who takes over a California bookstore.


=== Helen Hayes ===
American stage and screen actress Helen Hayes portrayed Miss Marple in two American made-for-TV movies near the end of her decades long acting career, both for CBS: A Caribbean Mystery (1983) and Murder with Mirrors (1985). Sue Grafton contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story Murder Is Easy, playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.


=== Joan Hickson ===

From 1984 to 1992, the BBC adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled Miss Marple. Joan Hickson played the lead role. In the 1940s, Joan appeared on-stage in an Agatha Christie play, Appointment with Death, which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, ""I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple"". (Coincidentally, Hickson had played a housekeeper in Murder, She Said, the first film in which Margaret Rutherford played Miss Marple.)  In addition she portrayed a maid in the 1937 film, Love from a Stranger, which starred Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone, another Agatha Christie play adaptation. As well as portraying Miss Marple on television, Hickson also narrated a number of Miss Marple stories on audio books. In the ""Binge!"" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue #1343–1344 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers picked Hickson as ""Best Marple"" in the ""Hercule Poirot & Miss Marple"" timeline.

=== Geraldine McEwan (2004–2008)/Julia McKenzie (2009–2013) ===

Beginning in 2004, ITV broadcast a series of adaptations of Agatha Christie's books under the title Agatha Christie's Marple, usually referred to as Marple. Geraldine McEwan starred in the first three series. Julia McKenzie took over the role in the fourth season.
The adaptations are notable for changing the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by Julie Cox in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in A Murder Is Announced) that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.

12,"Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator from Kentucky since 1985. A member of the Republican Party, he has been the Majority Leader of the Senate since January 3, 2015. He previously served as Minority Leader from 2007 to 2015. He is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate. McConnell is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.
During the administration of President Barack Obama, McConnell was known to the left as being an obstructionist, while opinion on the right was sharply divided. Some on the right praised him for tenacity and courage, while others criticized him for being part of the political establishment and not keeping his promises to conservatives. McConnell has gained a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician. However, this reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to pass a replacement for the Affordable Care Act in 2017.
From early 2016, McConnell refused to schedule Senate hearings for Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, to replace Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Garland's nomination remained before the Senate for 294 days, from March 16, 2016, until it expired on January 3, 2017, more than double the time of any other Supreme Court nomination. Later, McConnell used the so-called ""nuclear option"" to lower the threshold for overriding filibusters for Supreme Court nominees to a simple majority, with the aim of confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Court.


== Early life and education ==
McConnell is of Scots-Irish and English descent, the son of Addison Mitchell McConnell, and his wife, Julia (née Shockley). McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, in Sheffield, Alabama, and raised as a young child in nearby Athens.
As a youth, McConnell overcame polio, which he was struck with at age 2. He received treatment at the Warm Springs Institute in Georgia, which potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life. In 1990, McConnell said that his family ""almost went broke"" because of costs related to his illness.
When he was eight, McConnell's family moved to Georgia. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Louisville, where he attended duPont Manual High School. He graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964. McConnell was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He has maintained strong ties to his alma mater and ""remains a rabid fan of its sports teams."" In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.
In March 1967, shortly before graduating from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve at Louisville, Kentucky. In August 1967, after five weeks of military training at Fort Knox, he received an honorable discharge for medical reasons (optic neuritis).


== Early career ==
McConnell began interning for Senator John Sherman Cooper (R-KY) in 1964, and his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate eventually himself. Later, McConnell was an assistant to Senator Marlow Cook (R-KY) and was a Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald R. Ford, where he worked alongside future Justice Antonin Scalia. In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County Judge/Executive, the former top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky. He was re-elected in 1981.


== U.S. Senate ==


=== Elections ===
1984

In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last returns came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin—only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%. McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called ""Where's Dee"", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston, implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to ""Switch to Mitch"".
1990

In 1990, McConnell faced a tough re-election contest against former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.
1996

In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%, even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. In keeping with a tradition of humorous and effective television ads in his campaigns, McConnell's campaign ran television ads that warned voters to not ""Get BeSheared"" and included images of sheep being sheared.
2002

In 2002, he was re-elected against Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%, the largest majority by a statewide Republican candidate in Kentucky history.
2008

In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.
2014

In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary. The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. Senator in a primary by either party since 1938. He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election. Although polls showed the race was very close, ultimately McConnell defeated Grimes by 56.2%–40.7%, resulting in a margin of victory of 15.5 percentage points – one of his largest margins of victory, second only to his 2002 margin.


=== Leadership ===
During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, McConnell was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Republicans maintained control of the Senate after both elections. He was first elected as Majority Whip in the 108th Congress and unanimously re-elected on November 17, 2004. Senator Bill Frist, the Majority Leader, did not seek re-election in the 2006 elections. In November 2006, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell to replace Frist as Minority Leader. After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.


=== Tenure ===


==== Reputation ====
According to The New York Times, in his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was ""something of a centrist"". In recent years, however, McConnell has veered sharply to the right. He now opposed collective-bargaining rights and minimum-wage increases that he previously supported, and abandoned pork barrel projects he once delivered to the state of Kentucky. He believed that Reagan's popularity made conservatism much more appealing.
According to a profile in Politico, ""While most politicians desperately want to be liked, McConnell has relished—and cultivated—his reputation as a villain."" The Politico profile also noted ""For most of Obama's presidency, McConnell has been the face of Republican obstructionism."" According to Salon, ""Despite McConnell's reputation as the man who said his No. 1 goal was to stop President Obama from winning a second term, it's been McConnell at the table when the big deals—be they over threatened government shutdowns, debt defaults or fiscal cliffs—have been finalized.""
Reporter Alec MacGillis wrote a book about Mitch McConnell, published by Simon & Schuster on December 23, 2014, titled The Cynic, which alludes to the author's belief that McConnell mostly acts the way he does for political gains and not out of ideology.
With a 49% disapproval rate in 2016, he had the highest disapproval rate out of all senators. McConnell has repeatedly been found to have the lowest home state approval rating of any sitting senator.


==== Foreign policy ====
After winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1984, McConnell backed anti-apartheid legislation with Chris Dodd. McConnell went on to engineer new IMF funding to ""faithfully protect aid to Egypt and Israel,"" and ""promote free elections and better treatment of Muslim refugees"" in Myanmar, Cambodia and Macedonia. According to a March 2014 article in Politico, ""McConnell was a 'go-to guy' for presidents of both parties seeking foreign aid,"" but he has lost some of his idealism and has evolved to be more wary of foreign assistance.

In August 2007, McConnell introduced the Protect America Act of 2007, which allowed the National Security Agency to monitor telephone and electronic communications of suspected terrorists outside the United States without obtaining a warrant. McConnell was the only party leader in Congress to oppose the resolution that would authorize military strikes against Syria in September 2013, citing a lack of national security risk.
On March 27, 2014, McConnell introduced the United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions bill, which would provide additional funding and instructions to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in response to the 2014 Crimea crisis.
In September 2016, the Senate voted 71 to 27 against the Chris Murphy–Rand Paul resolution to block the $1.15 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen has been accused of war crimes. Following the vote, McConnell said: ""I think it's important to the United States to maintain as good a relationship with Saudi Arabia as possible.""


==== Campaign finance ====
McConnell argued that campaign finance regulations reduce participation in political campaigns and protect incumbents from competition. He spearheaded the movement against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (known since 1995 as the ""McCain–Feingold bill"" and from 1989 to 1994 as the ""Boren–Mitchell bill""), calling it ""neither fair, nor balanced, nor constitutional."" His opposition to the bill culminated in the 2003 Supreme Court case McConnell v. Federal Election Commission and the 2009 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. McConnell has been an advocate for free speech at least as far back as the early 1970s when he was teaching night courses at the University of Louisville. ""No issue has shaped his career more than the intersection of campaign financing and free speech,"" political reporter Robert Costa wrote in 2012. In a recording of a 2014 fundraiser McConnell expressed his disapproval of the McCain-Feingold law, saying, ""The worst day of my political life was when President George W. Bush signed McCain-Feingold into law in the early part of his first Administration.""
On January 2, 2013, the Public Campaign Action Fund, a liberal nonprofit group that backs stronger campaign finance regulation, released a report highlighting eight instances from McConnell's political career in which a vote or a blocked vote (filibuster), coincided with an influx of campaign contributions to McConnell's campaign. Progress Kentucky, a SuperPAC focused on defeating McConnell in 2014, hosted a press conference in front of the Senator's Louisville office to highlight the report's findings.


==== Flag Desecration Amendment ====
McConnell opposed the Flag Desecration Amendment in 2000. According to McConnell: ""We must curb this reflexive practice of attempting to cure each and every political and social ill of our nation by tampering with the Constitution. The Constitution of this country was not a rough draft. It was not a rough draft and we should not treat it as such."" McConnell offered an amendment to the measure that would have made flag desecration a statutory crime, illegal without amending the Constitution.


==== Health policy ====
In August 2001, McConnell introduced the Common Sense Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 2001. The bill would require that a health care liability action must be initiated within two years, non-economic damages may not exceed $250,000, and punitive damages may only be awarded in specified situations.
McConnell voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act) in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. In 2014, McConnell repeated his call for the full repeal of Obamacare and said that Kentucky should be allowed to keep the state's health insurance exchange website, Kynect, or set up a similar system. McConnell is part of the group of 13 Senators drafting the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors. The Senator refused over 15 patient advocacy organization's requests to meet with his congressional staff to discuss the legislation. This included groups like the American Heart Association, March of Dimes, American Lung Association. and the American Diabetes Association.
McConnell received the Kentucky Life Science Champion Awards for his work in promoting innovation in the life science sector.
In 2015, both houses of Congress passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It was vetoed by President Obama in January 2016.
After President Trump took office in January 2017, Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, began to work on a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They faced opposition from both Democrats and moderate Republicans, who claimed that the bill would leave too many people uninsured, and more conservative Republicans, who protested that the bill kept too many of the ACA's regulation and spending increases, and was thus not a full repeal. Numerous attempts at repeal failed. On June 27, after a meeting with President Trump at the White House, McConnell signaled improvements for the repeal and replacement: ""We're not quite there. But I think we’ve got a really good chance of getting there. It’ll just take us a little bit longer."" During a Rotary Club lunch on July 6, McConnell said, ""If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur.""


==== Economy ====
In July 2003, McConnell sponsored the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2003. The bill would protect small businesses from litigation excesses and limit the liability of non-manufacturer product sellers.
McConnell was the sponsor of the Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008. The bill, which did not pass, would have allowed states to engage in increased offshore and domestic oil exploration in an effort to curb rising gas prices.
In June 2008, McConnell introduced the Alternative Minimum Tax and Extenders Tax Relief Act of 2008. The bill was intended to limit the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax.

In an interview with National Journal magazine published October 23, 2010, McConnell explained that ""the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" Asked whether this meant ""endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president,"" McConnell clarified that ""if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it's not inappropriate for us to do business with him.""
In September 2010, McConnell sponsored the Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2010. The bill would have permanently extended the tax relief provisions of 2001 and 2003 and provided permanent Alternative Minimum Tax and estate tax relief.
In 2010, McConnell requested earmarks for the defense contractor BAE Systems while the company was under investigation by the Department of Justice for alleged bribery of foreign officials.
In June 2011, McConnell introduced a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment. The amendment would require two-thirds votes in Congress to increase taxes or for federal spending to exceed the current year's tax receipts or 18% of the prior year's GDP. The amendment specifies situations when these requirements would be waived.
In December 2012, McConnell called for a vote on giving the president unilateral authority to raise the federal debt ceiling. When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) called for an up or down vote, McConnell objected to the vote and ended up filibustering it himself. In 2014, McConnell voted to help break Ted Cruz's filibuster attempt against a debt limit increase and then against the bill itself.
After two intersessions to get federal grants for Alltech, whose president T. Pearse Lyons made subsequent campaign contributions to McConnell, to build a plant in Kentucky for producing ethanol from algae, corncobs, and switchgrass, McConnell criticized President Obama in 2012 for twice mentioning biofuel production from algae in a speech touting his ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy.
In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress). It was a bill that ""punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination."" McConnell said that he opposed the legislation because it would ""line the pockets of trial lawyers"", not help women.
In July 2014, McConnell expressed opposition to a U.S. Senate bill that would limit the practice of corporate inversion by U.S. corporations seeking to limit U.S. tax liability.


==== Environment ====
McConnell expressed skepticism that climate change is a problem, telling the Cincinnati Enquirer editorial board in 2014, ""I'm not a scientist, I am interested in protecting Kentucky's economy, I'm interested in having low cost electricity."" 
McConnell was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, McConnell has received over $1.5 million from the oil and gas industry since 2012.


==== Gun rights ====
On the weekend of January 19–21, 2013, the McConnell for Senate campaign emailed and robo-called gun-rights supporters telling them that ""President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms."" McConnell also said, ""I'm doing everything in my power to protect your 2nd Amendment rights."" On April 17, 2013, McConnell voted against expanding background checks for gun purchases.


==== Iraq War ====
In October 2002, McConnell voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq. McConnell supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In 2010, McConnell ""accused the White House of being more concerned about a messaging strategy than prosecuting a war against terrorism.""
In 2006, McConnell publicly criticized Senate Democrats for urging that troops be brought back from Iraq. According to Bush's Decision Points memoir, however, McConnell was privately urging the then President to ""bring some troops home from Iraq"" to lessen the political risks. McConnell's hometown paper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, in an editorial titled ""McConnell's True Colors"", criticized McConnell for his actions and asked him to ""explain why the fortunes of the Republican Party are of greater importance than the safety of the United States.""
Regarding the failure of the Iraqi government to make reforms, McConnell said the following on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer: ""The Iraqi government is a huge disappointment. Republicans overwhelmingly feel disappointed about the Iraqi government. I read just this week that a significant number of the Iraqi parliament want to vote to ask us to leave. I want to assure you, Wolf, if they vote to ask us to leave, we'll be glad to comply with their request.""
On April 21, 2009, McConnell delivered a speech to the Senate criticizing President Obama's plans to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, and questioned the additional 81 million dollar White House request for funds to transfer prisoners to the United States.


==== Fundraising ====

From 2003 to 2008, the list of McConnell's top 20 donors included five financial/investment firms: UBS, FMR Corporation (Fidelity Investments), Citigroup, Bank of New York, and Merrill Lynch.
In April 2010, while Congress was considering financial reform legislation, a reporter asked McConnell if he was ""doing the bidding of the large banks."" McConnell has received more money in donations from the ""Finance, Insurance and Real Estate"" sector than any other sector according to the Center for Responsive Politics. McConnell responded ""I'd say that that's inaccurate. You could talk to the community bankers in Kentucky."" The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute ""endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks"", said McConnell. He expressed concern that the proposed $50 billion, bank-funded fund that would be used to liquidate financial firms that could collapse ""would of course immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready to bail out large banks"". In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: ""We have read that the Republicans have a plan for financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth."" According to one tally, McConnell's largest donor from the period from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, was Bob McNair, contributing $1,502,500.


==== 2016 Supreme Court vacancy ====
In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell, speaking of President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court (to fill the vacancy caused by Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016) said, ""One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'""


==== 2016 presidential election ====
McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Following Paul's withdrawal, McConnell stayed neutral for the remainder of the primary. On May 4, 2016, McConnell endorsed then presumptive nominee Donald Trump. ""I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching the nomination."" 
On multiple occasions, McConnell criticized Trump but continued to endorse Trump's candidacy. On May 27, 2016, after Trump suggested that a Federal Judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell responded, ""I don't agree with what he (Trump) had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else."" On July 31, 2016, after Trump had criticized the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, a Muslim soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell stated, ""Captain Khan was an American hero, and like all Americans, I'm grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like Captain Khan and their families have made in the war on terror. All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services."" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell stated: ""As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.""
With regards to the US response to intelligence findings that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks undertaken to influence the American election, after Trump won the election, Senator McConnell expressed ""support for investigating American intelligence findings that Moscow intervened."". Prior to the election however, when FBI Director James Comey, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and other officials met with the leadership of both parties to make the case for a bipartisan statement warning Russia that such actions would not be tolerated ""McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics,"" The Washington Post reported, citing accounts of several unnamed officials.
On February 7, 2017, McConnell stopped Senator Elizabeth Warren who was reading out statements opposing Jeff Sessions's nomination as federal judge that had been made by Ted Kennedy and Coretta Scott King, on the grounds of Senate Rule XIX. He defended his decision by saying ""She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,"" a statement which was turned into a battle cry by Warren supporters.
On April 2, McConnell denied knowing anything about potential wiretapping of Trump by the Obama administration, saying there was an ongoing investigation.

13,"printk is a function that prints messages and is used in the C Programming Language exclusively for the Linux Kernel. It accepts a string parameter called the format string, which specifies a method for rendering an arbitrary number of varied data type parameter(s) into a string. The string is then printed to the kernel log.
It provides a printf-like abstraction and its parsing of the format string and arguments behave exactly the same way. It acts as a debugging tool for kernel programmers who need this function for logging messages from the kernel.
The printk function prototype is:

In kernel mode, you can't use the standard C library, so printf is not available, hence the need for printk.


== Difference with printf ==


=== Logging Levels ===
printk has an optional prefix string: Loglevel.
Loglevel specifies the type of message being sent to the kernel message log. The syntax with loglevel is:

Different Loglevels, along with their numerical values, are shown here:
When a log level is not specified, the default log level is KERN_WARNING, unless a different default has been set in the kernel itself.
Loglevels are defined in <linux/kern_levels.h>. Which log levels are printed is configured in the /proc/sys/kernel/printk sysctl file (format: console level, default message level, minimum console level, default console level).


=== Pointer formats ===
The %p format is extended to support advanced parameter formatting. For example: %pISpc of a struct sockaddr * would print an IPv4/v6:port in the usual way (e.g. ""1.2.3.4:12345"" or ""[1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8]:12345"" depending on the address family). Extensive format list in the Format Reference.


== Description ==
The function tries to grab the console semaphore (console_sem). If it succeeds, the output is logged and the console drivers are called. If it is not possible to grab the semaphore the output is placed into the log buffer. The current holder of the console semaphore (console_sem) will notice the new output in release_console_sem and will send it to the consoles before releasing the semaphore.
One effect of this deferred printing is that code which calls printk and then changes console_loglevel may break. This is because console_loglevel is inspected when the actual printing occurs.
printk() can be called from anywhere in the Kernel at any time. It can be called from interrupt or process context. It can be called while a lock is held. It can be called simultaneously on multiple processors, yet it does not require the caller to hold a lock.

17,"The Natural Resources Stewardship Project was a Canadian non-profit organization that presented itself as undertaking ""a proactive grassroots campaign to counter the Kyoto Protocol and other greenhouse gas reduction schemes while promoting sensible climate change policy."" The group was founded in October 2005 but failed from lack of funding.
A report in the Toronto Star on January 28, 2007 stated that the organization had not revealed who funds the Stewardship Project. The Guardian and Vancouver Sun stated in 2008 that the organization is funded by energy firms.
Until April 2008, it was headed by global warming skeptic Tom Harris, formerly Ottawa director of the consulting firm High Park Group, and, until later in 2008, Tim Ball, formerly Professor of Geography at the University of Winnipeg. Harris has stated that the NRSP was set up on the initiative of the High Park Group.
NRSP has been mentioned in at least two op-ed pieces. [1]
According to the Toronto Star, the group has been described by critics as an Astroturf organization.

26,"Charles Stuart (7 November 1677 – 12 December 1677) was the first of two sons and third of seven children born from the marriage between James, Duke of York (later James II of England & VII of Scotland) and Mary of Modena. He was styled Duke of Cambridge, but never formally created so, because he died so young.


== Life ==
At the time of his birth at St James's Palace, Charles was the second surviving child of James and Mary, a sister, Catherine Laura, having died the previous year. Another sister, Isabella, one year older than Charles, died at the age of four in 1681. At the time of Charles' birth, his uncle, Charles II of England, had no legitimate children and his queen consort, Catherine of Braganza, was reaching the age of 40 and it was clear enough that she would have no children and that the Duke of York would succeed as King.
Because all of James' sons with his first wife, Anne Hyde, were dead, the newborn Charles would then succeed to the throne, which was a possibility that caused much concern in England and Scotland because both James and Mary were Catholics and the majority of people wanted a Protestant monarch. Like so many of his brothers and sisters, the infant Duke lived for a little more than a month, dying on 12 December the same year he was born, but his parents' beliefs cost them their crowns. Charles was buried in Westminster Abbey, on 13 December 1677. His younger brother was James Francis Edward Stuart, The Old Pretender.


== Arms ==
During his short life, Charles bore a coat of arms, as a grandson of a British Sovereign, consisting those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of five points ermine.

27,"Gatundu is a small town in Kiambu County of Kenya. It is known for the first Kenyan president Jomo Kenyatta who lived about three kilometres away from the town, as well as his son, Uhuru Kenyatta, now the 4th President of Kenya and former Member of Parliament representing Gatundu South Constituency. The town is located on a hill surrounded by many farms and residences.


== Demographics ==
Gatundu has an approximate population of 20,000 people who reside and work within and near the town.


== Location ==
Gatundu town is located west of Thika about 29 Kilometers, road distance through Mang'u and north of Kiambu about 44 Kilometers, road distance through Ruiru. It is currently in Kiambu County. Back in 1960s-2007, Gatundu was in Kiambu District which would later be split and Gatundu itself became a District. Gatundu town hosted the district headquarters. Kenyatta Road connects the town to the newly constructed Thika Highway. It is road used to access Nairobi from Gatundu. The town is located on a hill which makes it difficult to expand.


== Administration ==
Gatundu is the administrative headquarters of Gatundu and constituency. It also hosts the Gatundu sub- county offices, under the Government of Kiambu led by William Kabogo as the governor.
Gatundu sub-county has two constituencies: Gatundu North Constituency and Gatundu South Constituency. Gatundu South Constituency is represented by Moses Kuria (MK) as the Member of Parliament after Jossy Ngugi Nyumu died in office in May 2014. Moses Kuria was announced the area MP in August 2014 without a by-election after the only opponent, Kiarie Kamere stepped down.
Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, the current president of Kenya was the area MP for 2 terms from 2002-2013.
Gatundu North Constituency is currently represented by Kigo Njenga as the Member of parliament.
Gatundu Law Courts are located near the Gatundu District hospital. Modern law courts were built after the old ones once caught fire. The law courts were officially opened in March 2014 by the Kenya's Chief Justice Dr. Willy Mutunga.


== People and religion ==

The Gatundu people on social media formed a registered group to create oneness and self-reliance among the youth and entire community at large. Qwetu Welfare Association aims at creating employment through development initiatives and charitable projects in Gatundu.
Gatundu belongs to rural highland north of capital Nairobi. Local people are mainly of the Kikuyu people also called the Agikuyu. The town also has several people from other ethnic groups in Kenya presented in the region for business purposes.
The people in this town are mostly Christians. Several churches are present, including
Martyrs of Uganda Catholic Church
Oasis of Hope
P.C.E.A Marima
Christian Church international C.C.I.
Gospel Power Center
among others.


== Economy ==
The main economic activity in Gatundu town is business. Businessmen and businesswomen in this town do their day-to-day activities in various businesses. A two storey modern market in the town attracts many buyers and sellers from the neighboring villages and towns. There is only one supermarket called Happy Supermarket and several general stores.

The neighboring villages are agricultural productive and therefore feed the market with fresh agricultural commodities.


== Financial institutions ==
Due to investments and businesses in the town, there are various banks, microfinace institutions and SACCO'S including:
Equity Bank
Family Bank
KCB
Co-operative Bank
Pamoja Women Development Programme
Tai SACCO
Eekuria SACCO
Unaitas SACCO


== Transport and communication ==
The local public service vans, minibuses and taxis play a major role in transport industry of this town. Vans (also called matatus) transport passengers from the town to other towns including Nairobi city, Thika, Ruiru, Juja and Kamwangi towns. A big challenge is the road network. Except the roads connecting the town to Nairobi and Thika, all the other roads are dry weather roads which makes it impassable during rainy seasons to connect to the highly productive villages.

Motorbikes also called ""boda bodas"" are common in the town. Together with tuk tuks, they offer transport services within the town and the surrounding villages.
The area is covered well by the local mobile service providers in Kenya namely safaricom, Orange and Airtel. Mobile phones are therefore commonly used as the means of communication. Several cyber cafes also assist with internet services.
There is also Gatundu Post Office.


== Academic institutions ==
The town lacks higher institutions of learning. There is Gatundu Primary School, a public school. Private primary schools are many including:
Happy Times
Gloria Primary School
Good Luck Primary school
Harti Primary School


== Higher Institutions of Learning ==
The town lacks major higher institutions of learning like universities and colleges. However, Mama Ngina University College has been proposed in the region. Currently, there is Gatundu Institute of Business Studies.


== Health institutions ==
Gatundu Level 4 Hospital serves almost all health needs of the people in this region.
On 13 August 2013, construction was launched on a Chinese-funded expansion to the Gatundu District Hospital, Gatundu Level IV Hospital, in Kenya. The 5300 square meter expansion included a modern medical wing with five-floors, four elevators, outpatient services, an emergency department, 12 ICU beds, 84 beds, medical laboratory, maternity unit, operating theater, wards, and several units of medical equipment, including CT scanners and X-ray scanners. The assistance by China was in response to a request by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2011 costing about 11 million USD, with an estimated construction time of 20 months. On 13 April 2016, President Uhuru Kenyatta officially opened the new wing of Gatundu Level 4 hospital.
St. Jude Nursing Home located at Gatundu-Juja road is a private hospital. Other private clinics are also established in the region including:

It is situated in the east of province in the Valle del Genal. The municipality is situated approximately 22 kilometres from Ronda and 113 from the provincial capital of Málaga. It belongs to the comarca of Serranía de Ronda.

The town had been one of the White Towns of Andalusia, with buildings traditionally whitewashed. In spring 2011, buildings in the town (including the church and gravestones) were painted smurf-blue by Sony Pictures to celebrate the premiere of the Smurfs movie. 4,000 litres (880 imp gal; 1,100 US gal) of paint were used. In December 2011, Sony offered to repaint the town white. Citizens voted to leave the buildings painted blue, as an estimated 80,000 tourists visited in the six months following the repainting.

38,"In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many other states are known to exist only in extreme situations, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter, and quark-gluon plasma, which only occur in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high-energy color-charged matter respectively. Some other states are believed to be possible but remain theoretical for now. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.
Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, but as well as neutral atoms, it contains a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.
The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.


== The four fundamental states ==


=== Solid ===

In a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The forces between particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by force, as when broken or cut.
In crystalline solids, the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different crystal structures, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, iron has a body-centred cubic structure at temperatures below 912 °C, and a face-centred cubic structure between 912 and 1394 °C. Ice has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.
Glasses and other non-crystalline, amorphous solids without long-range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.
Solids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of sublimation, and gases can likewise change directly into solids through deposition.


=== Liquid ===

A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the temperature and pressure are constant. When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being water, H2O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its critical temperature.


=== Gas ===

A gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
In a gas, the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an ideal gas), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point, or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.
At temperatures below its critical temperature, a gas is also called a vapor, and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the vapor pressure of the liquid (or solid).
A supercritical fluid (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and critical pressure respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract caffeine in the manufacture of decaffeinated coffee.


=== Plasma ===

Like a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a ""sea"" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron ""sea"" allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.
A gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways. e.g. Either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are ""free"", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.
The plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either lightning, electric sparks, fluorescent lights, neon lights or in plasma televisions. Also plasma appears in some types of flame, the Sun's corona, and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.


== Phase transitions ==

A state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of states distinguished from any other set of states by a phase transition. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states. The appearance of superconductivity is associated with a phase transition, so there are superconductive states. Likewise, ferromagnetic states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties. When the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called mesophases. Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology. 
The state or phase of a given set of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions, transitioning to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence; for example, solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature. Near absolute zero, a substance exists as a solid. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its melting point, boils into a gas at its boiling point, and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.
Forms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. Superfluids (like Fermionic condensate) and the quark–gluon plasma are examples.
In a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An aqueous solution is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).


== Non-classical states ==


=== Glass ===

Glass is a non-crystalline or amorphous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of silicate plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers. Thermodynamically, a glass is in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.


=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===
A plastic crystal is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an orientational glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a quenched disordered state.
Similarly, in a spin glass magnetic disorder is frozen.


=== Liquid crystal states ===

Liquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the nematic phase consists of long rod-like molecules such as para-azoxyanisole, which is nematic in the temperature range 118–136 °C. In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.
Other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in liquid crystal displays.


=== Magnetically ordered ===
Transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.
In a ferromagnet—for instance, solid iron—the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a magnetic domain). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent magnet, which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The magnetization disappears when the magnet is heated to the Curie point, which for iron is 768 °C.
An antiferromagnet has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in nickel(II) oxide (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.
In a ferrimagnet, the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is magnetite (Fe3O4), which contains Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions with different magnetic moments.
A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name ""liquid"" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a ferromagnet, where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an antiferromagnet, where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by geometrically frustrated magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must ""choose"" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.


=== Microphase-separated ===

Copolymers can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form nanometer-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.
Ionic liquids also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.


== Low-temperature states ==


=== Superfluid ===

Close to absolute zero, some liquids form a second liquid state described as superfluid because it has zero viscosity (or infinite fluidity; i.e., flowing without friction). This was discovered in 1937 for helium, which forms a superfluid below the lambda temperature of 2.17 K. In this state it will attempt to ""climb"" out of its container. It also has infinite thermal conductivity so that no temperature gradient can form in a superfluid. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in quantized vortices.
These properties are explained by the theory that the common isotope helium-4 forms a Bose–Einstein condensate (see next section) in the superfluid state. More recently, Fermionic condensate superfluids have been formed at even lower temperatures by the rare isotope helium-3 and by lithium-6.


=== Bose–Einstein condensate ===

In 1924, Albert Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose predicted the ""Bose–Einstein condensate"" (BEC), sometimes referred to as the fifth state of matter. In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.
In the gas phase, the Bose–Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman, of JILA at the University of Colorado at Boulder, produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose–Einstein condensate is ""colder"" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) quantum levels, at temperatures very close to absolute zero (−273.15 °C).


=== Fermionic condensate ===

A fermionic condensate is similar to the Bose–Einstein condensate but composed of fermions. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.


=== Rydberg molecule ===
One of the metastable states of strongly non-ideal plasma is Rydberg matter, which forms upon condensation of excited atoms. These atoms can also turn into ions and electrons if they reach a certain temperature. In April 2009, Nature reported the creation of Rydberg molecules from a Rydberg atom and a ground state atom, confirming that such a state of matter could exist. The experiment was performed using ultracold rubidium atoms.


=== Quantum Hall state ===

A quantum Hall state gives rise to quantized Hall voltage measured in the direction perpendicular to the current flow. A quantum spin Hall state is a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the Quantum Hall state of matter.


=== Photonic matter ===

Photonic matter is a phenomenon where photons interacting with a gas develop apparent mass, and can interact with each other, even forming photonic ""molecules"". The source of mass is the gas, which is massive. This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no rest mass, and cannot interact.


=== Dropleton ===

A ""quantum fog"" of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid, rather than existing as discrete pairs.


== High-energy states ==


=== Degenerate matter ===

Under extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as degenerate matter, which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, ""degenerate"" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents two fermionic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.
Electron-degenerate matter is found inside white dwarf stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. Neutron-degenerate matter is found in neutron stars. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally free neutrons outside an atomic nucleus will decay with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as Jupiter and in the even more massive brown dwarfs, which are expected to have a core with metallic hydrogen. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.


=== Quark matter ===

In regular cold matter, quarks, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the strong force into hadrons that consist of 2–4 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactively decay.
Strange matter is a type of quark matter that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 2–3 solar masses), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as strange quarks, a heavier analogue of the common down quark. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.
Quark–gluon plasma is a very high-temperature phase in which quarks become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of gluons, subatomic particles that transmit the strong force that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in particle accelerators, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark–gluon plasma was discovered at CERN in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.
At high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct color-flavor locked (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is superconductive for color charge. These phases may occur in neutron stars but they are presently theoretical.


=== Color-glass condensate ===

Color-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a ""gluonic wall"" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark–gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.


== Very high energy states ==
Various theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the baryon asymmetry in the universe, but little is known about it. In string theory, a Hagedorn temperature is predicted for superstrings at about 1030 K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At Planck temperature (1032 K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these state and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these statws are important in cosmology because the universe may have passed through these states in the Big Bang.
The gravitational singularity predicted by general relativity to exist at the center of a black hole is not a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of spacetime at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location, leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.


== Other proposed states ==


=== Supersolid ===

A supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties. Similar to a superfluid, a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape. Although a supersolid is a solid, it exhibits so many characteristic properties different from other solids that many argue it is another state of matter.


=== String-net liquid ===

In a string-net liquid, atoms have apparently unstable arrangement, like a liquid, but are still consistent in overall pattern, like a solid. When in a normal solid state, the atoms of matter align themselves in a grid pattern, so that the spin of any electron is the opposite of the spin of all electrons touching it. But in a string-net liquid, atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin. This gives rise to curious properties, as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.


=== Superglass ===

A superglass is a phase of matter characterized, at the same time, by superfluidity and a frozen amorphous structure.


=== Dark matter ===

While dark matter is estimated to comprise 83% of the mass of matter in the universe, most of its properties remain a mystery due to the fact that it neither absorbs nor emits electromagnetic radiation, and there are many competing theories regarding what dark matter is actually made of. Thus, while it is hypothesized to exist and comprise the vast majority of matter in the universe, almost all of its properties are unknown and a matter of speculation, because it has only been observed through its gravitational effects.

39,"Lawrence Montaigne (February 26, 1931 – March 17, 2017) was a Jewish-American actor, writer, dancer, and stuntman. As an actor, he was known for his appearances on many 1960s-era television shows such as Star Trek.


== Life and career ==
Born in New York, but later raised in Rome, Italy, Montaigne spoke several languages - a skill he used to his advantage in securing roles in international productions. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was only one platoon apart in the Parris Island boot camp from his future friend Steve McQueen.
He appeared in the role of Dr. Chauncy Hartlund in the 1965 Perry Mason episode, ""The Case of the Carefree Coronary."" In 1966, Montaigne portrayed the Romulan Decius in the Star Trek episode ""Balance of Terror""; he had nearly been cast as Mr Spock when it was possible that Leonard Nimoy would appear on Mission Impossible. A year later, he portrayed the Vulcan Stonn, the paramour of Spock's intended bride T'Pring, in the episode ""Amok Time""—a role that he reprised in 2006 in the unofficial mini-series Star Trek: Of Gods and Men.
Additionally, he guest starred on Batman, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Blue Light, Mission: Impossible, The Time Tunnel, The Invaders, Perry Mason, McCloud, and The Feather and Father Gang.
His motion picture appearances include roles in The Great Escape (1963), Captain Sindbad (1963), Tobruk (1967), The Power (1968), The Psycho Lover (1970), Escape to Witch Mountain (1975), Framed (1975), Young Lady Chatterley (1977), Deadly Blessing (1981) and Dakota (1988). During the 1980s, Montaigne taught film at North Texas State University.
For some years, Montaigne lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, and translated medical texts for a publishing firm. In 2007, Montaigne voiced a guest starring role in the pilot episode of the web series Star Trek: The Continuing Mission.
Montaigne died on March 17, 2017, at the age of 86.

40,"Vincent E. Egan was an executive and entertainment company founder. Egan founded VEE Corporation for the Sesame Street Live touring shows. He was a founder of the Event and Arena Marketing Conference. By 2009, Vincent had been married and divorced twice.


== Life ==
Vincent E. Egan was raised in north Minneapolis. As a young adult, he worked for GM as a district sales manager primarily in Montana. In 1970, he returned to Minnesota and bought a Dayton farm on 2.5 acres. He kept the farm despite taking a job in Chicago in 1970. The job he took was as a marketer with the Ice Follies, which had a show segment with the Sesame Street Muppets. He was elevated through the ranks until he was vice president of marketing and operations. However, in 1978, he was fired after a disagreement with his boss thus returned to his Dayton farm. He looked for a job as a shoe salesman to no avail.
After months of unemployment, in the late 1979 and 1980, Egan focused on the idea of family entertainment. As at the time, there were only three touring family shows, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and two ice shows, Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice. He based it off his time working for the Ice Follies which had a segment with those Sesame Street Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson's company and Children's Television Workshop, who were interested. Egan refinanced his home mortgage for $25 thousand in additional funding and found an equity investor. With the funding for his corporation that he started on March 14, 1980, VEE Corporation was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children's Television Workshop for the characters.
The first Sesame Street Live show opened in September 1980 at the Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington, Minnesota for a five-day run. That show was successful. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at Madison Square Garden's 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people. Egan was able to expand to Henson's Muppets tours in the mid-1980s and other show.
Around 2000, Egan purchased the equity fund's stake in the corporation. On April 1, 2015, Blue Star Media, LLC purchased VEE Corporation with Egan continuing on as a consultant. On December 1, 2016, Vincent E. Egan died.

=== 1859–1864 ===
The separation of Queensland as a separate colony in 1859 lead to the establishment of an initial 16 electoral districts, returning 26 members (that is, some elected multiple representatives, number of members in parentheses): 

Members elected during this period:
Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1860–1863


=== 1864–1872 ===
In 1864, the Additional Members Act created six more electoral districts, each with 1 member, resulting in the following set of electorates (number of members in parentheses):

This made a total of 22 electorates with 32 members.
Members elected for this period:

=== 1872–1878 ===
The Electoral Districts Act (1872) resulted in 42 one-member electorates for the 1873 election, while in 1875 the Cook District Representation Act added the Electoral district of Cook.
Four electorates were renamed:
Hamlet of Fortitude Valley became Fortitude Valley
Town of Brisbane became Brisbane City

Two electorates were abolished:
Eastern Downs
Western Downs
Twenty-two new electorates were introduced at the 1873 elections (by the 1872 Act) plus Cook in 1876, resulting in the following set of electorates (number of members shown in parentheses) :

So 22 electorates with 2 abolished and 22 introduced resulted in 42 electorates each returning 1 member (1873) and 43 electorates each returning 1 member (1876).

It was not until his court appearance a year later (June 22, 2006) that he confessed to having stolen a total of 97 maps from six institutions — Boston Public Library, Harvard University (Houghton Library), Newberry Library (in Chicago), New York Public Library (the Rare Book and Map Divisions), and Yale University (Beinecke Library and the Sterling Memorial Library) in the United States, as well as the British Library in London. At the time of his arrest, the British Library had already identified him as a suspect and was about to call in the police. Smiley originally said he had been stealing maps for approximately seven years but later reduced that figure to four years.
In August 2015, Ronald Grim, a curator of the Boston Public Library, traveled to an antiquities dealer in New York to confirm what he recognized to be a map stolen from the library years prior. It was a rare map advertised in that New York antiques dealer’s summer catalog, and had been created by explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1612. It provided a description of the New England coast and what would later become Canada. According to library records, the map was last seen by Forbes Smiley inside the library on January 2, 2003. A photograph of the map taken by the library in 1992 was key in proving the map was owned by the Boston Public Library, and after months of legal wrangling it was finally returned.
The recovery of the Champlain map led to discussions on whether Smiley (still living on Martha’s Vineyard) stole more maps than recorded, and what more can be done to recover them.


== Sentencing ==
At his federal sentencing on September 27, 2006, Judge Janet Bond Arterton took note of his cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation: ""If you steal human treasures, then you will go to prison, but if you help recover them, this will be taken into account and weighed in the balance"". Since all but ten of the 97 maps Smiley admitted stealing had been recovered, he was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment. Later, in May 2007, he was ordered to pay US$2.3 million in restitution. (The original valuation on the stolen maps had been over US$3 million.) Reported losses by a handful of leading dealers who had unwittingly sold stolen maps acquired from Smiley ran to more than US$400,000 each in three cases; no details have been given about any reimbursement. A second sentencing before a state judge, Richard Damiani, on 13 October 2006, confirmed the earlier sentence, though the judge was critical of the trust placed in Smiley's statements by his federal counterpart.


== Coverage ==
The case was widely covered across the United States and elsewhere. Smiley pleaded guilty and he was never cross-examined. Apart from the details he supplied himself, much of the available information came from journalists. Some suspected that Smiley had taken more maps than he admitted. Each of the affected libraries issued lists of missing maps. Several of the entries matched copies of books, now missing their maps, which Smiley had examined. For example, Smiley had admitted stealing from Harvard University an example of the map of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, illustrating a letter from Hernán Cortés (1524), but a prior photograph of the example missing from Yale's Beinecke Library proved instead that it was theirs.
Several questions remain unanswered, in particular about the origin and purpose of high quality facsimiles of early maps, some found on Smiley's person when he was arrested, and others in books he examined.
Smiley is the subject of a non-fiction book, The Map Thief: The Gripping Story of an Esteemed Rare-Map Dealer Who Made Millions Stealing Priceless Maps, written by Michael Blanding and published by Gotham Books on May 29, 2014.


== Legacy ==

As a result of Smiley's thefts, research libraries are now more aware of the vulnerability of maps illustrating volumes in their rare book collections, and are improving their documentation and security procedures. At the same time they appreciate the importance to scholars of continued access to such works. The changes are noticeable at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library, where a comprehensive program of cataloging and digitizing the early map collection is under way, funded largely by a donation of US$100,000 from William Reese, who had acted as Yale's advisor throughout the Smiley affair. Some libraries now monitor their reading rooms with continuous video surveillance.
Smiley was not the first major map thief. Miles Harvey's book The Island of Lost Maps — about the convicted map thief Gilbert Bland — describes a number of earlier thieves including two Europeans active in or before 2001. However, Smiley may be responsible for more financial and cultural loss than any of his predecessors.
Smiley was released from prison on January 15, 2010.

46,"Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 0-4-0 represents one of the simplest possible types, that with two axles and four coupled wheels, all of which are driven. The wheels on the earliest four-coupled locomotives were connected by a single gear wheel, but from 1825 the wheels were usually connected with coupling rods to form a single driven set.
The notation 0-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself, rather than in an attached tender.
In Britain, the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod-coupled driving wheels.
Under the UIC classification used in Europe and, in more recent years, in simplified form in the United States, an 0-4-0 is classified as B (German and Italian) if the axles are connected by side rods or gearing and 020 (French), independent of axle motoring. The UIC's Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored, which would be 0-2-2-0 under the Whyte notation.


== Overview ==
The term Four-coupled is often used for 0-4-0 locomotives. Four-wheeled is also sometimes used, but this term can also encompass other wheel arrangements, for example Stephenson's Rocket which was an 0-2-2 four-wheeled locomotive.
0-4-0 locomotives were built as tank locomotives as well as tender locomotives. The former was more common in Europe and the latter in the United States, except in the tightest of situations such as that of a shop switcher, where overall length was a concern. The earliest 0-4-0 locomotives were tender engines and appeared as early as c. 1802. 0-4-0 tank engines were introduced in the early 1850s. The type was found to be so useful in many locations that they continued to be built for more than a century and existed until the end of the steam era.

Richard Trevithick's Coalbrookedale (1802), Pen-y-Darren (1804) and Newcastle (1805) locomotives were of the 0-4-0 type, although in their cases the wheels were connected by a single gear wheel. The first 0-4-0 to use coupling rods was Locomotion No. 1, built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. Stephenson also built the Lancashire Witch in 1828, and Timothy Hackworth built Sans Pareil which ran at the Rainhill Trials in 1829. The latter two locomotives later worked on the Bolton and Leigh Railway.
A four-wheeled configuration, where all the wheels are driving wheels, uses all the locomotive's mass for traction but is inherently unstable at speed. The type was therefore mainly used for switchers (United States) and shunters (United Kingdom). Because of the lack of stability, tender engines of this type were only built for a few decades in the United Kingdom. They were built for a longer period in the United States.
The possible tractive effort of an 0-4-0 within normal axle load limits was not enough to move large loads. By 1900, they had therefore largely been superseded for most purposes by locomotives with more complex wheel arrangements. They nevertheless continued to be used in situations where tighter radius curves existed or the shorter length was an advantage. Thus, they were commonly employed in dockyard work, industrial tramways, or as shop switchers.
The wheel arrangement was also used on specialised types such as fireless locomotives, crane tanks, tram engines and geared steam locomotives. It was also widely used on narrow gauge railways.


== Usage ==


=== Australia ===
In New South Wales, Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum has preserved twelve 0-4-0 steam locomotives and eight 0-4-0 diesel locomotives, a total of twenty (20) examples, all on the one site.


=== Angola ===

The Catumbela Sugar Estate in Angola operated a narrow gauge line on the estate. One of their 0-4-0 locomotives, Rührthaler Maschinen-Fabrik 963 of 1929, was later rebuilt with a diesel engine.


=== Finland ===

Finland had the E1 and Vk4 classes with an 0-4-0 wheel arrangement.
The E1 was a class of only two locomotives, numbered 76 and 77.
The Vk4 was also a class of only two locomotives, built by Borsig Lokomotiv Werke (AEG) of Germany in 1910. The Vk4s were used at a fortress, and were eventually also used in dismantling the fortress, after which one locomotive went into industrial use and was scrapped in 1951. The other was sold to the Finnish Railways and nicknamed Leena. It became no. 68 and is now the oldest working broad gauge locomotive in Finland, being preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.


=== Indonesia ===
The Semarang-Cheribon Stoomtram Maatschappij (SCS) imported 27 standard gauge 0-4-0T locomotives of the B52 class between 1908 and 1911, originally to operate services from Kalibrodi-Semarang to Tanggung and Yogyakarta. They were built by Sächsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz, Germany. They were a modern locomotive design for the time, equipped with a superheater.
The largest allocation of B52 class locomotives was in Tegal, Central Java for services to Purwokerto. Some were later converted to tram engines and worked in Tegal and Purwokerto.
All 27 locomotives were in existence at the end of 1960, but by 1970 only 15 units remained. Two locomotives have been preserved, B5212 at the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Museum of Transport and B5210 at the Railway Museum Ambarawa.


=== New Zealand ===
The NZR A class of 1873 consisted of three engine types of similar specification but differing detail. They were British and New Zealand-built and several were preserved.


=== South Africa ===


==== Brunel gauge ====

In 1847, the government of the Cape Colony established harbour boards at its three major ports, Table Bay, Port Elizabeth and East London. While railway lines were laid at all these harbours, trains were for the most part initially hauled by oxen or mules. The first steam locomotives to see service at these harbours were 7 ft 1⁄4 in (2,140 mm) Brunel gauge engines which were placed in service on breakwater construction at Table Bay Harbour in 1862 and East London Harbour in 1874.
At Table Bay Harbour a third Brunel gauge 0-4-0T locomotive was acquired from Fletcher, Jennings & Co. in 1874 to haul tip-wagons from the Victoria Basin excavation site to the breakwater which was being constructed simultaneously.
The East London Harbour’s construction locomotives were 0-4-0 vertical boiler engines, similar in appearance to the American Grasshopper type. Four of them were acquired from Alexander Chaplin & Co. between 1873 and 1880, although the first one was only placed in service in 1874.
A fourth locomotive was added at Table Bay Harbour in 1879, a 0-4-0 well-tank engine, also built by Fletcher, Jennings.
Three 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotives entered breakwater construction service in Table Bay Harbour, two in 1881 and one more in 1893, built by Black, Hawthorn & Co.


==== Standard gauge ====

In September 1859 Messrs. E. & J. Pickering, contractors to the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company for the construction of the Cape Town-Wellington railway line, imported a small 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) broad gauge 0-4-0 side-tank steam locomotive from England for use during the construction of the railway. This was the first locomotive in South Africa. In 1874 the locomotive was rebuilt to a 0-4-2T configuration before it was shipped to Port Alfred, where it served as construction locomotive on the banks of the Kowie river and was nicknamed Blackie. It has been declared a heritage object and was plinthed in the main concourse of Cape Town station.

The first railway locomotive to run in revenue earning service in South Africa was a small broad gauge 0-4-0WT well tank engine named Natal, manufactured by Carrett, Marshall and Company of Leeds. It made its inaugural run from Market Square to Point station in Durban during the official opening of the first operating railway in South Africa on Tuesday, 26 June 1860.
In 1865, the Natal Railway Company obtained a saddle-tank locomotive with a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement from Kitson and Company. This was the Natal Railway’s second locomotive and was named Durban.
In 1878, while construction work by the Kowie Harbour Improvement Company was underway at Port Alfred, the Cape Government Railways acquired one broad gauge 0-4-0ST locomotive named Aid from Fox, Walker and Company of Bristol for use as construction locomotive on the east bank of the Kowie river.


==== Cape gauge ====
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of 0-4-0 tank- and saddle-tank locomotives were imported into South Africa, many of them for use in harbours. Many of these locomotives came into South African Railways (SAR) stock in 1912, but were never classified.

In 1873 and 1874, three Cape gauge saddle-tank locomotives, built by Manning Wardle, were placed in service by the Cape Government Railways, two on the Midland System in 1873 and the third on the Western System in 1874. They were the first Cape gauge locomotives to enter service in South Africa.
In 1874, a third saddle-tank locomotive, also built by Manning Wardle, was delivered to the Midland System of the CGR in Port Elizabeth. The locomotive was of a smaller design than the earlier locomotives of 1873.
Between 1875 and 1882, six saddle-tank locomotives with domeless boilers and three with domes were placed in service on all three Systems of the CGR. They were all designated 1st Class when a classification system was adopted.
In 1881, two Cape gauge saddle tank locomotives with a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement were placed in service by Teague and Company, who operated Teague’s Tramway at the Kimberley diamond mine. In 1885 one was sold to the mine and the other to the Cape Government Railways (CGR) for use during the construction of a temporary rail bridge across the Orange River at Norvalspont. In the process the CGR locomotive, nicknamed Coffee Pot, became the first locomotive to run across the border between the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State.
Thirteen saddle-tank locomotives were acquired by the Table Bay Harbour Board from Black, Hawthorn and Company, Chapman and Furneaux and Hawthorn Leslie and Company between 1881 and 1904. Eleven survived to come into SAR stock in 1912, but were not included in the renumbering schedules or classified.

In 1889 the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorwegmaatschappij (NZASM) obtained its first six locomotives for use on the new line which was being constructed from Johannesburg to Boksburg, one 13 Tonner and five very similar 14 Tonners.
In 1889 and 1890 the NZASM obtained three 10 Tonner tramway locomotives for use on the new line from Johannesburg to Boksburg which became known as the Randtram line.
In 1891 five saddle-tank locomotives were imported, built by Neilson and Company for the Natal Government Railways (NGR). One was later sold to the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway (PPR), where it was named Natal, while two more went to the Durban Harbour. The remaining two were later included in the NGR's Class K. In 1912, four of these locomotives survived, including the ex PPR locomotive, to be taken onto the SAR roster as obsolete unclassified locomotives.
Between 1894 and 1902 eight saddle-tank locomotives were acquired by the Port Elizabeth Harbour Board for shunting service at the Port Elizabeth Harbour, four built by Black, Hawthorn in 1894 and 1895, two by Chapman and Furneaux in 1900 and two by Hudswell, Clarke in 1902.

In 1902 the Harbours Department of the Natal Government placed a single 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotive in service as harbour shunter in Durban Harbour. It was built by Hudswell, Clarke and named Congella.
In 1903, a single 0-4-0ST locomotive, built by New Lowca Engineering, was delivered to the Port Elizabeth Harbour Board.
After the Harbour Boards were disbanded, some locomotives entered SAR harbour service as previously owned. Two locomotives named Stormberg and Thebus were originally built by Hudswell Clarke for the South African Public Works Department in 1903. They were acquired by the SAR in 1916, but were named instead of being classified and numbered.
The CGR acquired a single self-contained Railmotor with a 0-4-0T+4 wheel arrangement for low-volume passenger service. The railmotor was a 0-4-0 side-tank locomotive with a passenger coach as an integral part of the locomotive itself, with a four-wheeled bogie under the coach end.

In 1907, the Central South African Railways also acquired a single self-contained Railmotor with a 0-4-0T+4 wheel arrangement.
In 1929, the South African Railways acquired a single self-contained Clayton railmotor with a 0-4-0+4 wheel arrangement for low-volume passenger service. The vehicle was a vertical boilered steam locomotive with a passenger coach which was an integral part of the locomotive itself.
In 1941, long after the Harbour Boards had ceased to exist, a contractor’s locomotive which had been imported c. 1939 for use on the Foreshore land reclamation project in Cape Town was bought by the SAR for use as dock shunter in Table Bay Harbour. It had been built in 1909 by Orenstein & Koppel and on the SAR it was numbered SAR-H&NW no. 69.


==== Narrow gauges ====

Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank condensing locomotives were placed in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in the Cape Colony. They were the first condensing steam locomotives to enter service in South Africa. They were later rebuilt as conventional well-tank locomotives.
In 1899, Rand Mines acquired two narrow gauge tank steam locomotives from Avonside Engine Company and in 1900 a similar locomotive was delivered to Reynolds Brothers Sugar Estates in Natal. In 1915, when an urgent need arose for additional narrow gauge locomotives in German South West Africa during the First World War, these three locomotives were purchased second-hand by the South African Railways.

In 1900 the British War Office placed two Sirdar class 0-4-0T tank steam locomotives in service on a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge line near Germiston in the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, where the Royal Engineers had established a siege park during the Second Boer War. The locomotives were built by Kerr, Stuart and Company. At the end of the war, the two Sirdar locomotives were sold to a farmer, who used them on a firewood line between Pienaarsrivier and Pankop, until the line and locomotives were taken over by the Central South African Railways (CSAR). In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the SAR, they were renumbered with an ""NG"" prefix to their numbers. When a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced by the SAR somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were designated Class NG1.
In 1902, the Cape Government Railways placed a single narrow gauge tank steam locomotive in service on the Avontuur branch, built by Manning Wardle, classified Type C and named Midget. In 1912, this locomotive was assimilated into the South African Railways and renumbered. It was sold to the West Rand Consolidated Mines near Krugersdorp in 1921.
A single small 5-ton locomotive, built by Krauss & Company, was purchased by the Cape Government Railways c. 1903 and placed in service as construction engine on the narrow gauge Avontuur branch out of Port Elizabeth.


=== United Kingdom ===


==== Tank locomotives ====

The tank engine version of the wheel arrangement began to appear in the United Kingdom in the early 1850s, with the first significant class being six saddle tanks designed by Robert Sinclair for the Caledonian Railway.

By 1860 the type was very popular and it continued to be built in significant numbers for both mainline and industrial railways, almost to the end of steam traction. Hudswell Clarke were supplying industrial saddle tanks until at least 1947, and both Barclay and Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns until 1949.
An interesting variation on this theme were the traction engine based railway locomotives built by Aveling and Porter.
The last British Railways 0-4-0ST dock shunters were built by Horwich Works as late as 1955 and survived until 1966.


==== Tender locomotives ====

During the 1840s, the wheel arrangement was widely used by Edward Bury on the bar-framed locomotives built for the London and Birmingham Railway. However, with the exception of a few isolated examples used by the smaller companies such as the Cambrian Railways, the Furness Railway and the Taff Vale Railway, and four examples built by Edward Fletcher (engineer) of the North Eastern Railway between 1854 and 1868, the 0-4-0 tender locomotive had been largely superseded on Britain's mainline railways by 1850.


=== United States of America ===


==== Tank locomotives ====

An early example of the 0-4-0 vertical boiler type was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Atlantic no. 2, built in 1832 by Phineas Davis and Israel Gartner. In the United States, the 0-4-0 tank locomotive was principally used for industrial railway purposes.


==== Tender locomotives ====

In the United States, the Best Friend of Charleston was the first locomotive to be built entirely within the United States. It was built in 1830 for the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company by the West Point Foundry of New York.
The John Bull was built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Camden and Amboy Railroad in New Jersey in 1831, but was later rebuilt as a 4-2-0.
The Pennsylvania Railroad kept producing 0-4-0 classes long after all other major railroads had abandoned development of the type, building their final A5s class into the 1920s. The A5s was a monster among 0-4-0s, larger than many 0-6-0 designs, with modern features found on few others of its type, such as superheating, power reverse, piston valves, and several others. The Pennsy continued to build the type because it had a large amount of confined and tight industrial track, more than most other railroads had.


== 0-4-0 Diesel locomotives ==
The wheel arrangement was also used on a number of small 0-4-0DM diesel-mechanical shunters produced by John Fowler & Co. and other builders in the 1930s and earlier. Similarly, it was perpetuated on a number of diesel-mechanical and 0-4-0DH diesel-hydraulic classes between 1953 and 1960 (see the List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes). Many of these were later sold for industrial use.
There are 0-4-0DE diesel-electric locomotives too, although small in number. The smallest diesel switchers, such as the EMD Model 40, were of this arrangement.

47,"A Federal Firearms License (FFL) is a license in the United States that enables an individual or a company to engage in a business pertaining to the manufacture or importation of firearms and ammunition, or the interstate and intrastate sale of firearms. Holding an FFL to engage in certain such activities has been a legal requirement within the United States since the enactment of the Gun Control Act of 1968. The FFL is issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE, commonly known as the ""ATF"").


== History ==
The Federal Firearms License was established to implement the Gun Control Act of 1968. The FFA required all manufacturers and dealers of firearms who ship or receive firearms or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce to have a license, and forbade them from transferring any firearm or most ammunition to any person interstate unless certain conditions were met. As a practical matter, this did not affect the interstate commerce in firearms or ammunition. It was with the adoption of the Gun Control Act in 1968, which repealed most of the FFA, that the lawful interstate trade of firearms was limited almost entirely to persons holding a Federal Firearms License in the United States.


== Types ==


== Special Occupational Tax Classes ==
Certain types of firearms, accessories and other weapons are currently restricted under the National Firearms Act (NFA). In addition to a current FFL (of whatever ""type"" is applicable), the ATF requires that business owners who are planning to import, manufacture or deal in restricted materials also pay a Special Occupational Tax, or ""SOT"" (thereby making the business owner a ""Special Occupational Taxpayer"").
Class 1 SOT status requires an importer FFL, either Type 8 or 11.
Class 2 SOT status requires a manufacturer FFL, either Type 7 or 10.
Class 3 SOT status requires a dealer or manufacturer FFL, either Type 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11.


== Collectors of Curio and Relic (C&R) Firearms ==
C&R firearms are defined in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 478.11 as those ""...of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons."" To be recognized by ATF as a C&R firearm, a firearm must fall into at least one of the following three categories:
Firearms manufactured more than 50 years prior to the current date, not including replicas
Firearms certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum that exhibits firearms as curios or relics of museum interest
Any other firearms that derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event. Proof of qualification of a particular firearm under this category requires evidence of present value and evidence that like firearms are not available except as collector's items, or that the value of like firearms available in ordinary commercial channels is substantially less.
C&R firearms include most manually operated and semi-automatic firearms used by a military force prior to 1967. This includes most firearms used by the warring nations in World War I and World War II. However, the firearm must normally also be in its original configuration to retain the C&R designation. So, for example, an unaltered Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle used by the German Army in World War II is a C&R firearm – but the same rifle ""sporterized"" with a new stock and finish is generally not considered a C&R firearm. There is an ambiguous point in how the license is currently administered, in that some firearms altered by the militaries that issued them have been confirmed by the ATF to retain C&R status, though whether this applies to all such conversions (the examples given by the ATF were the Spanish M1916 Guardia Civil, FR-7, and FR-8 Mausers) also remains ambiguous. However, as long as the receiver (the part of the firearm that is regulated by the ATF) is over 50 years old (was manufactured before 1967) the firearm qualifies as a Curio & Relic – ATF states explicitly that, in addition to newer firearms it individually approves, firearms automatically achieve C&R status upon turning 50, provided they are in original configuration. If modified significantly, the 50 year clock resets to the date of modification. (Specific examples are available in the ATF FAQs.) Certain automatic firearms have been designated as C&R firearms, and a C&R may be used to acquire these as well.
Collectors may acquire C&R firearms in interstate commerce, e.g., via mail or phone order or the Internet, or in person. (This is especially important for collectors of pistols and revolvers since they may not otherwise be acquired outside a collector's state of residence.) Collectors are not considered to be FFL dealers and have no special privileges concerning non-C&R firearms, nor may they ""engage in the business"" of regularly selling C&R firearms to persons who do not have an FFL. Selling of a C&R firearms does not require an FFL transfer across state lines, only if the firearm has a collectable status. The purpose of the C&R license is to enable a collector to acquire C&R firearms for his/her personal collection and not to become a firearms dealer.


=== Curio & Relic Compliance Inspections ===

(D) At the election of a licensed collector, the annual inspection of records and inventory permitted under this paragraph shall be performed at the office of the Attorney General designed for such inspections which is located in closest proximity to the premises where the inventory and records of such licensed collector are maintained.
—ATF 2005 Regulations page 18. (ATF Publication 5300.4)

Licensed collectors may also elect to have the inspection conducted at their homes. While C&R compliance used to consist of just bringing the bound book to the appropriate office, Inspectors are now (2009) often requiring that collectors bring their inventory (collection) to their office if they can not inspect them in the home.


=== Conversion of C&R firearms ===
Any firearm sold as a C&R firearm once changed out of its original configuration cannot be resold as a C&R firearm. In regard to conversions; certain pistols have been approved for sale with added safety conversions (i.e. Polish and Romanian Tokarev pistols, to which a manual safety was added to meet import requirements). Certain other modifications, such as period sporterisations, are arguably C&R qualified as they represent the gun culture of the period. An example would be a Lee–Enfield or 98K Mauser military rifle that had been converted into a continental style sporter before World War II. These common conversions occurred more than 50 years ago, and represent a sub-type of special interest to collectors.


== Antique guns ==
Federal law defines guns manufactured in or before 1898 as ""antique"", (27 CFR §478.11) and they are generally unregulated in federal law. They may be bought and sold across state lines without an FFL. The only exceptions are short-barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, and machine guns, which are regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Unlike C&R guns, antique guns can be re-arsenalized, sporterized, re-barreled, or re-chambered, yet they will still retain their Federally exempt status. Even if every part except the receiver is replaced, a pre-1899 firearm still qualifies as an antique. FFL holders have been directed not to enter Pre-1899 guns into their Bound Books.


== Record keeping ==
FFL holders are required to keep a registry of firearms sales in an ATF-approved Bound Book, or a computerized equivalent using ATF-approved software. Licensed dealers must also maintain file copies of Form 4473 or eForm 4473 ""Firearms Transaction Record"" documents, for a period of not less than 20 years after the date of sale or disposition. When retiring or otherwise relinquishing a license, these records are sent to the ATF's Out-of-Business Records Center. Licensed collectors are not required to send their records to the ATF when relinquishing their license. The ATF is allowed to inspect, as well as request a copy of the Form 4473 from the dealer during the course of a criminal investigation. In addition, the sale of two or more handguns to a person in a five business day period must be reported to ATF on Form 3310.4.


== Conditions of application ==
ATF will approve the application if the applicant:

51,"The Dutch East Indies Campaign of 1941–42 was the conquest of the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) by forces from the Empire of Japan in the early days of the Pacific Campaign of World War II. Forces from the Allies attempted unsuccessfully to defend the islands. The East Indies were targeted by the Japanese for their rich oil resources which would become a vital asset during the war. The campaign and subsequent three and a half year Japanese occupation was also a major factor in the end of Dutch colonial rule in the region.


== Background ==
The East Indies was one of Japan's primary targets if and when it went to war because the colony possessed abundant valuable resources, the most important of which were its rubber plantations and oil fields; the colony was the fourth-largest exporter of oil in the world, behind the U.S., Iran, and Romania. The oil made the islands enormously important to the Japanese (see below), so they sought to secure the supply for themselves. They sent four fleet carriers and a light carrier along with the four fast battleships of the Kongō class, 13 heavy cruisers and many light cruisers and destroyers to support their amphibious assaults in addition to conducting raids on cities, naval units and shipping in both that area and around the Indian Ocean.
Access to oil was one of the linchpins of the Japanese war effort, as Japan has no native source of oil; it could not even produce enough to meet even 10% of its needs, even with the extraction of oil shale in Manchuria using the Fushun process. Japan quickly lost 93 percent of its oil supply after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order on 26 July 1941 which froze all of Japan's U.S. assets and embargoed all oil exports to Japan. In addition, the Dutch government in exile, at the urging of the Allies and with the support of Queen Wilhelmina, broke its economic treaty with Japan and joined the embargo in August. Japan's military and economic reserves included only a year and a half's worth of oil. As a U.S. declaration of war against Japan was feared if the latter took the East Indies, the Japanese planned to eliminate the U.S. Pacific Fleet, allowing them to overtake the islands; this led to the attack on Pearl Harbor.


== Declarations of war ==
In late November, the Netherlands government in the East Indies under the Dutch government-in-exile (already at war with Imperial Japan's Axis power ally Germany in Europe) began preparing for war against Japan itself: ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy were sent to sea and the KNIL Air Force was mobilised. On 4 December, three days after having decided on a policy of war against America, Britain and the Netherlands, the Japanese government decided instead to ""treat the Netherlands as a quasi enemy until actual hostilities ... occur."" This was in the hopes that the Dutch would not preemptively destroy oil installations before the Japanese were ready to invade. On 8 December 1941, in a public proclamation, the Netherlands declared war on Japan. By 7:00 a.m. on the day of the attack, the East Indies government had warned merchantmen at sea to make for the nearest port. At that hour, the governor general made a public announcement over the radio that the Netherlands ""accepts the challenge and takes up arms against the Japanese Empire."" Instructions had been telegraphed to the embassy in Tokyo at 2:30 a.m., even before news of the attack on Pearl Harbor had reached the Dutch government in London at 4:00. The instructions were only received on the evening of the next day, and the declaration of war was finally handed to the Japanese foreign minister, Shigenori Tōgō, by the Dutch ambassador, J. C. Pabst, on the morning of 10 December. The Swedish ambassador agreed to handle Dutch interests for the duration of the conflict.
The Dutch declaration did not alter the Japanese decision, and the latter's declaration of war did not come until 11 January 1942. When Japan was charged with waging a ""war of aggression"" before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1946, it was argued that her attitude towards the Netherlands proved otherwise, since the Dutch had declared war first. The tribunal rejected this, on the grounds that Japan's sole intention was ""to give less time to the Netherlands for destroying oil wells."" They found that the Netherlands' declaration was in self-defence.


== Campaign ==
General Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, began the campaign by sending the 16th Army under command of General Hitoshi Imamura to attack Borneo. On 17 December, Japanese forces successfully landed on Miri, an oil production centre in northern Sarawak, with support from a battleship, an aircraft carrier, three cruisers and four destroyers.
Initially, the Japanese forces launched air strikes on key areas and gained air superiority. Following the airstrikes, landings were made at several locations targeting airfields and other important points in the area. In addition to the landings at Miri, the Japanese forces made landings at Seria, Kuching, Jesselton and Sandakan between 15 December 1941 and 19 January 1942. After these main objectives in Borneo were completed, the Japanese forces planned a three-pronged assault southward using three forces named Eastern Force, Center Force and Western Force. The aim of this assault was to capture the oil resources in the East Indies. The Eastern Force was to advance from Jolo and Davao and move on to capture Celebes, Amboina and Timor, while protecting the Center Force's flank. The Center Force was to capture oil fields and airfields in Tarakan Island and Balikpapan. Both these forces would support the Western Force, which was to attack and capture the oil refineries and airfields in Palembang. The Japanese forces launched the assault on 11 January and landed at Tarakan.

To coordinate the fight against the Japanese, the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces combined all available land and sea forces under the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM or ABDA) banner. This command was activated on 15 January 1942, with the overall commander being British Field Marshal Sir Archibald Wavell. The command structure had the American Army Air Force Lieutenant General George Brett as deputy commander, the British Lieutenant General Henry Royds Pownall as chief of staff; under them were the American Admiral Thomas C. Hart as naval commander, the Dutch Lieutenant General Hein ter Poorten as ground forces commander, and the British Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse as the air commander. Although the forces were combined, they had differing priorities: the British believed the defense of the territory of Singapore and the eastern entrances to the Indian Ocean (the route to British Ceylon and British India) to be paramount, the Americans and Australians did not want a total penetration of Southwest Asia that would deprive them of bases necessary for any serious counterattack, and the Dutch considered Java and Sumatra, their ""second homeland where [they] had been trading and living for over three centuries"", to be the most important place to defend.
Even the combined forces could not stop or even slow the Japanese advance due to their much greater numbers; to face the Japanese attacking naval forces, the ABDA command had a conglomerate of ships drawn from any available units, which included the U.S. Asiatic Fleet (fresh from the fall of the Philippines), a few British and Australian surface ships, and Dutch units that had previously been stationed in the East Indies. Major forces included two seaplane tenders (USS Langley and Childs), two heavy cruisers (USS Houston and HMS Exeter), seven light cruisers (HNLMS De Ruyter, Java and Tromp, USS Marblehead and Boise, HMAS Hobart and Perth), 22 destroyers, and, perhaps their greatest strength, 25 American and 16 Dutch submarines. Being based on Java, these ships had to take on the central and western prongs of the three-headed Japanese assault; the central force's combat ships, the light carrier Ryūjō, the seaplane tenders Sanyo Maru and Sanuki Maru, three light cruisers and 16 destroyers, while the western force contained five heavy cruisers, and seven destroyers. In addition, four Japanese fleet carriers (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryū and Sōryū) and the four Kongō-class battleships were in the theater of operation.

The Japanese forces were using Tarakan airfield as a forward airbase by 17 January, and Balikpapan was also captured a week later. However, the Dutch garrisons had destroyed the oil fields before they were captured by the Japanese in both cases. Several Japanese vessels were destroyed or damaged due to naval and air counterattacks from the Allied forces, but the defending Dutch battalions were overrun by the Japanese forces. By 28 January, the Japanese had taken control of the airfields at Balikpapan, and their aircraft were operating from them. By the end of January, Japanese forces had captured parts of the Celebes and Dutch Borneo. By February, Japanese forces had landed on Sumatra and encouraged a revolt in Aceh.
Most of the naval components of the allied force were crushed in the battles of Java Sea, Sunda Strait and Second Java Sea; the only American ship larger than a destroyer to survive was the old cruiser Marblehead. In addition, the land forces on the islands were quickly overwhelmed and most major resistance was overcome within two months of the initial assaults, although a guerrilla campaign in Timor was successfully waged for a time. The ABDA command was dissolved at about 01:00 on 1 March, less than two months after its inception, by Admiral Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich, Governor-General of the East Indies.
Allied operations in Indonesia (except Sumatra) were later controlled by the South West Pacific Area command, under General Douglas MacArthur.


== Aftermath ==

Allied forces did not attempt to retake the islands of Java, Sumatra, Timor, or Bali during the war. Japanese forces on those islands surrendered at the conclusion of World War II. Most of the Japanese military personnel and civilian colonial administrators were repatriated to Japan following the war, except for several hundred who were detained for investigations of war crimes, for which some were later put on trial. About 1,000 Japanese soldiers deserted from their units and assimilated into local communities. Many of these soldiers provided assistance to Indonesian Republican forces during the Indonesian National Revolution.

52,"Dinah McNabb was a unionist politician in Northern Ireland.
Born in Lurgan, McNabb studied at Queen's University, Belfast. She was elected to Armagh County Council for the Ulster Unionist Party, and was then elected at the Northern Ireland general election, 1945 in North Armagh, serving until her retirement in 1969.
McNabb was a strong supporter of the Lord's Day Observance Society and throughout the 1940s campaigned against greyhound racing on Sundays, particularly in her home town of Lurgan.
McNabb was a bitter opponent of the development of the new town of Craigavon in the area she represented, and was in particular concerned that compensation payments to farmers took no account of their attachment to the land. In February 1966, she gave a thirty-minute speech attacking the project, which culminated in her resignation from the government. She lent support to other projects, and led calls for the construction of a bridge or tunnel to connect Northern Ireland with Britain.
McNabb also served as the first Chairman of the 1966 Committee of backbenchers, from its establishment until 1968, and was the President of the Federation of Soroptimists of Great Britain and Ireland.

53,"VMware Horizon View is a commercial desktop-virtualization product developed by VMware, Inc for Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X Operating Systems. Its was first sold under the name VMware VDM, but with the release of version 3.0.0 in 2008 it was changed to ""VMware View"" which then became ""Horizon View"" with the launch of version 6 in April 2014. 


== Features ==
VMware Horizon View provides remote-desktop capabilities to users using VMware's virtualization technology. A client desktop operating-system - typically Microsoft Windows 7, Vista or XP - runs within a virtual environment on a server. The VMware View product has a number of components which are required to provide the virtual desktops, including:
VMware vSphere for Desktops (includes ESXi, VMware's hypervisor)
VMware vCenter Server (management of virtualization environment)
View Composer (advanced View management, with automation and cloning)
View Manager (administration of the View Environment)
View Client (communication between View and the desktop OS)
VMware ThinApp (application virtualization)
View Persona Management (user profile management)
vShield Endpoint (offloaded desktop antivirus)
Although VMware licenses vSphere hypervisor per physical CPU-socket, it licenses VMware View per concurrent desktop. The bundled hypervisor, vSphere for Desktops, is functionally equivalent to vSphere Enterprise Plus.
VMware View has two licensing options, Enterprise and Premier. Enterprise comes with vSphere for Desktops, vCenter Server, and View Manager, and has an MSRP of $150 per concurrent desktop. View Composer, Persona Management, vShield Endpoint, and ThinApp are included in the Premier edition at an MSRP of $250 per concurrent desktop.
In order to transport a view of the desktop to users, keyboard, video, mouse and other interactions travel over a LAN connection. VMware View supports both the Microsoft-developed RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and the Teradici-licensed PCoIP (PC-over-IP) protocol.
Users establish client connections to VMware View sessions by running a VMware View Client on a local host. The product supports most versions of Windows, along with Mac OS X. Specific embedded clients are also supported for a large number of thin clients, for a list of supported clients refer to the VMware website.
An open-source product called ""VMware View Open Client"" can connect from a Linux or Mac OS X desktop to remote Windows desktops managed by VMware View. The client uses rdesktop under-the-hood to connect to the host. The VMware View Open Client was abandoned in 2013.
An HTML5 Client for VMware View is available to enable access to VMware View desktops directly from within any HTML5-compatible web browser such as Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox (for Windows, Linux, Mac and Chrome OS devices, such as Chromebooks).
Ubuntu 12.10 can login to VMware View desktops directly from the login screen.

54,"The Emirate of Mount Lebanon was an autonomous subdivision in the Ottoman Empire. The Emirate is considered to be an historical precursor of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate established in 1861, which was, in turn, the precursor of the Lebanese Republic of today. Historians have given different names to this entity: Shuf Emirate, Emirate of Jabal Druze, Emirate of Mount Lebanon, as well as Ma'an Emirate. The boundaries were not well defined. The town of Baakleen was the capital of the emirate during the Ma'an period until Fakhr-al-Din II chose to live in Dar El Qamar (nowadays Deir el Qamar) due to a water shortage in Baakleen. Dar El Kamar remained the capital until Bashir Shihab II ascended to the throne and made Beiteddine the capital. Beiteddine remains the capital of the Chouf District today.
Fakhr-al-Din II, the Druze prince and Lebanon's most prominent leader, was a strongman who was given leeway by the Ottomans to subdue and destroy other provincial leaderships in Ottoman Syria on their behalf, and who was himself destroyed in the end, to make way for a firmer control by the Ottoman state over the Syrian eyalets. The 'emir' was thus the dominant warlord in the Lebanese mountains.
Fakhr al-Din established a subtle symbiosis between the Maronites of Kisrawan and the Druzes of the Shuf mountains. After his downfall, the Ottomans tried different ways to break up this symbiosis, but all efforts failed. In the end, they returned power to the Maans in the person of Ahmad al-Maani, the grandnephew of Fakhr al-Din, in 1667.
The Maan and Shihab government of different parts of Mount Lebanon, between 1667 and 1841, was an Ottoman iltizam, or tax farm, rather than a dynastic principality, and the multazims were never reigning princes. The relations between the Porte and the Shihab emirs revolved around the payment of taxes, and the official legitimation of their position as multazims. Such was the precariousness of their position that over the more than three centuries of the two dynasties (1516–1840) only two significantly strong leaders emerged, Fakhr-Al-Din I (1516–1544) and his grandson Fakhr al-Din II (1591–1635). Bashir Shihab II (1788–1840) was also an important prince but he was viewed as a tyrant at the period rather than a leader. That led to the 1840 revolution against Bashir and his Egyptian allies .


== Maanid dynasty ==

The Ma‘ans came to power in the early 16th century, and both Fakhr al-Din I and Fakhr al-Din II greatly expanded the territory of the original Imarat al-Shuf while acting as the principal local tax farmer (multazim) for the Ottoman state.
In general, the tax-farming system meant that the multazims always served at the sultan's pleasure, and given this degree of insecurity they would try to collect as much tax as they could, within the limits of the taxpayers' physical ability to pay.


=== Fakhr al-Din I (1516–1544) ===
Fakhr al-Din I (1516–1544), was supposedly awarded with the emirate of the Shuf after fighting on the side of Selim I at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. In any case, he emerged soon afterwards as a local force, and was the first member of the Ma'an dynasty to serve the Ottomans.
The Ottomans divided the territories they conquered from the Mamluks into wilayas, sanjaks and nahiyas, and assigned qadis and military governors to the larger administrative divisions. However, they farmed out the task of tax collection to powerful local leaders, who maintained their positions by a combination of bribing local Ottoman officials and asserting themselves over less local power-holders.
The Ma'an family holdings (muqata'ah) were originally divided among the three wilayas of Damascus, Tripoli, and Sidon. The family had not been prominent under the Mamluks, but was strong enough under the Ottomans to be in charge of dividing the tax-farms assigned to it among a number of lesser local notables. By the end of his reign, Fakhr al-Din I's authority extended from the borders of Jaffa to Tripoli.


=== Qurqumaz (1544–1585) ===
Fakhr al-Din was succeeded by his son Qurqumaz, who was involved in frequent conflicts both with his neighbours and with the Ottomans, as the tax-farming system involved constant power struggles.
In 1544 the emir Qurqumaz succeeded his father Fakhr al-Din. In 1585, a caravan transporting the taxes collected in Egypt and Syria was plundered at Djun 'Akkar. The Ottomans, suspecting the Ma‘an of complicity and of having sheltered the criminals, invaded Lebanon. The emir Qurqumaz shut himself up in the inaccessible rock of Shakif Tirun near Jezzine and died there, 'of chagrin or poison', in 1585.
Qurqumaz was succeeded by his thirteen-year-old son, who became Fakhr al-Din II in 1591, after a hiatus of six years.


=== Fakhr-al-Din II (1591–1635) ===
Fakhr-al-Din II (1591–1635) was the most renowned of the Maanid rulers, although his position was as precarious as that of his predecessors and his successors.
In 1587, with the accession of Shah Abbas I, Safavid power began to revive, and the Ottoman–Persian Wars were soon resumed. In Syria, the Safavids could use local Shiite political leverage against the Ottomans.
To reduce the Shiite danger, the Ottomans turned to the Maans, who stood chastened and subservient after the successful Ottoman expedition sent against them in 1586. Their choice fell on Fakhr al-Din Maan, the son of Qurqumaz. In about 1590, Fakhr al-Din was appointed governor of the Sanjak of Sidon, to which the Sanjak of Beirut was subsequently attached. In 1598, as the wars between the Safavids and the Ottomans broke out again, he was also appointed governor of the Sanjak of Safad, which gave him direct control over the pro-Safavid Shiites of Jabal Amil.
In the 1610s he defeated his two principal opponents, Yusuf Sayfa and Amir Mansur ibn Furaykh. This, coupled with his attack on Damascus in 1607 (together with other local lords), evidently alarmed the Ottomans. In an attempt to achieve independence for Lebanon, he concluded a secret agreement with Ferdinand I of Tuscany, pledging to support each other against the Ottomans. After discovering the agreement, the Ottomans ordered Ahmad al Hafiz, governor of Damascus, to attack him. Fakhr al-Din temporarily abdicated in favour of his brother Yunus and his son Ali, and spent the next five years in exile in Europe. He only returned when his friend Muhammad Pasha became governor of Damascus in 1618. When he returned to Lebanon he ruled more or less unchallenged for the next fifteen years, as the Ottomans were too engrossed in their wars with the Safavids to give any serious attention to the situation.
In 1623, Mustafa Pasha, the new governor of Damascus, engaged him in battle, and was decisively defeated at Anjar in the Biqa Valley. Impressed by the victory, the Ottoman Sultan gave him the title of ""Sultan al Barr"" (Sultan of the Mountain).
Fakhr al-Din, in his later years, came to control the whole territory of modern Lebanon. Even then, the Shuf remained his power base. The control of the Sanjak of Safad, and also of the Sanjak of Ajlun and other parts of Transjordan, were at least as important, politically, as the control of the sanjaks of Beirut and Sidon, or the different mountain nahiyas of the Sanjak of Tripoli, in the Eyalet of Tripoli.
Eventually, however, the wali of Damascus, Kücük Ahmed Pasha, was despatched at the head of an army against Fakhr al-Din, who was defeated, captured and taken to Istanbul, where be was executed in 1635 along with Yunus and Ali.


=== Later emirs ===
The dynasty continued, greatly weakened, until the death of Ahmad (reigned 1658–1697) when its functions were taken over by the Shihab family.


== Shihab dynasty ==

When the last male descendant in the Maan family line died in 1697, his vassals chose Haydar al-Shihab as emir. The Shihab (or Chehab) family was somewhat unusual in a region politically dominated by Druze dynasties, as they were nominally practitioners of Sunni Islam.
The Shihabs, starting in 1711, introduced a unique system of fiscal cantons in the Shuf mountains and Kisrawan, and later in the northern Lebanon, giving their regime a special character within the Ottoman system. The Shihab emirs were appointed as multazims of their territories on an annual basis, and their position in this respect was always precarious, yet they remained at the top of the feudal hierarchy.
Under their government, the Druze and Maronite sheikhs of the different cantons worked in co~operation. Even the Druze sheikhs who were most vehemently opposed to the Shihab regime could not find a workable alternative to the Shihab system, for as long as this system remained in place.


=== Haydar al-Shihab (1697–1732) ===
Haydar was a Sunni, though his mother was a Druze from the Maan clan. He spent the next decade trying to win the support of various Druze and Shia clans in southern and central Lebanon. His rivals called in help from the Ottomans in 1711, but before the Ottoman expeditionary force could arrive, Haydar defeated his local rivals at the Battle of Andara and seized the former Mann capital of Deir el Qamar.
Through intermarriage, Haydar effected an alliance with two powerful Druze groups, the Abu-Lamma family and the Janbulad Family. That alliance lasted for most of the 18th century.


=== Milhim al-Shihab (1732–1753) ===
Milhim al-Shihab succeeded Haydar in 1732. Milhim repeatedly succeeded in avoiding the payment of the regular amount of taxes to the Ottoman authorities, and in 1748 the governor of Damascus launched a punitive expedition against him.
In the 1750s, Milhim attempted to acquire a firman confirming his authority over the Shuf and that of his nephew Quasim over Byblios, but the attempt failed, as the political climate in Istanbul changed after the death of Sultan Osman III in 1757.
After his abdication in 1753, the administration was run by Mansur and Ahmad al-Shihab for several years (1753–1763), and then by Qasim al-Shihab. A power struggle ensued, and in the 1760s Yusuf al-Shihab emerged as administrator of the Shuf.


=== Yusuf al-Shihab (1770–1788) ===

Yusuf, son of Mulhim, gained the title of emir in 1770. It is not clear whether or not Yusuf converted to Christianity, as he participated in both Muslim and Christian religious services and visited Druze and Christian shrines. During this period, the Lebanese mountains were relatively quiet, although feuds between individual families still frequently flared into violence. The status quo was shattered with the Mamluk invasion of Syria in 1770. Yusuf al-Shihab aided the Mamluks and his troops even briefly occupied Damascus. But in the aftermath of the Mamluk withdrawal, Sultan Mustafa III appointed Cezzar Ahmed Pasha to the governorship of Sidon. From his stronghold in Acre, Cezzar Ahmed steadily acquired territories that had been held by vassals of the Shihab clan.
In 1789, when there was an attempted coup against Cezzar Ahmed, he became convinced that Yusuf al-Shihab was behind it. In reprisal, he moved his army into Lebanon where he defeated the Shihabs in a battle in the Bekaa Valley. In defeat, Yusuf abdicated, and his vassals then chose his cousin Bashir.


=== Bashir Shihab II (1788–1841) ===

Bashir (usually referred to as Bashir II to distinguish him from Haydar's father) was emir until 1841, making him the longest-reigning emir of the Lebanese mountains. He was viewed as a tyrant at the time. In this period, Lebanon suffered from two famines. Also, Bashir destroyed everything that Fakhreddine had tried to establish: a strong Lebanon where all communities live in peace and harmony together. He made the Emirate weak because Mount-Lebanon and his prince were under the rule of the Jezzar of Acre and the Wali of Sidon, whereas it was exactly the opposite during Fakhreddine's reign. Also, he was the first leader that tried to split the Lebanese by establishing a policy consisting of religious discrimination. Bashir openly acknowledged that he was a Christian, marking a transition by which Maronites displaced the Druzes as the main power in the Lebanese Mountains. The Abi-Lamma clan, a Druze family who was a close ally of the Shihabs, also became Christians around the same time. After the death of Cezzar Ahmed in 1804, Bashir II moved to destroy' the feudal families his predecessors had relied upon as allies.
When Ibrahim Pasha moved his army into Syria in 1831, Bashir II offered his allegiance to the Egyptian forces and was granted extensive authority over much of Lebanon. He used his power to extract extra taxes and to impose military conscription, extremely unpopular measures that led to wide-scale revolts by Druze and Christian peasants. After the withdrawal of the Egyptian army in 1840, Bashir II surrendered to the British fleet anchored off Beirut and went into exile.


=== Bashir Shihab III (1841) ===

After Bashir II went into exile, the Ottoman sultan appointed Bashir III, Bashir II's distant cousin, as emir in 1841, but it was not it popular choice. Not long after his appointment the new emir called the principal Druze families to Deir el Qamar to discuss his tax policies. The families showed up armed and besieged him in his palace in October 1841. The stalemate ended when the sultan withdrew his appointment and Bashir III went into exile.
With that, the Shihab dynasty collapsed. There were attempts to restore Bashir III as Emir after the civil unrest in Lebanon in 1861, but they were unsuccessful.


== 1840–1860 Partition ==

In the mid-1840s, the population of the Emirate was estimated at around 300,000, of which less than 100,000 lived in ""mixed districts"".

Following continued animosity and fighting between the Maronites and the Druze, representatives of the European powers proposed to Sultan Abdülmecid I that the Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. The Sublime Porte was finally compelled to relinquish its plans for the direct rule of the Lebanon, and on December 7, 1842, the sultan adopted prince Metternich's proposal and asked Assad Pasha, the governor (wali) of Beirut, to divide the Mount Lebanon, into two districts: a northern district under a Christian Kaymakam and a southern district under a Druze Kaymakam, both chosen among tribal leaders. Both officials were to report to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut.

Carlos Green, who is blind, has received a wild card invitation to compete in the shot-put, while Shanntol Ince has received a wild-card to compete in swimming. Ince ""was born with her right leg significantly shorter than her left"".


== Disability classifications ==
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation (the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness); cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes (there is often overlap between this and other categories); visual impairment, including blindness; and Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

57,"Lüneburg is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southeast and clockwise) the districts of Lüchow-Dannenberg, Uelzen, Heidekreis and Harburg, and the states of Schleswig-Holstein (district of Lauenburg) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (district of Ludwigslust-Parchim).


== History ==
The Amt of Lüneburg appeared in 1862. At that time the Amt of Lüne moved its seat from Lüne Abbey into the Lüneburg Riding Academy and its name was changed. The district was established after the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866. From 1867 the Ämter of Lüneburg, Bleckede and the town of Lüneburg became parts of the district of Lüneburg, which was exclusively responsible for taxes and the military.
The history of the region has always been influenced by the town of Lüneburg: see there for more details.
In 1993 the municipality of Amt Neuhaus joined Lower Saxony and the District of Lüneburg. This region had always been ruled by Lüneburg before the division of Germany made it a part of East Germany after 1945. It is hence one of the very few municipalities of the former East Germany that are now in a state that was formerly in West Germany.
The district is one of the core areas for monuments and archaeological discoveries from prehistory. Ernst Sprockhoff noted 17 sites west of the Ilmenau and 32 east of it. The most outstanding are the sites of the Soderstorf Necropolis and the Oldendorfer Totenstatt.


== Geography ==
The district is characterised by the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide) in the south and the riverside woodlands along the Elbe. Though most of the district is located south of the river, there is a small portion around the municipality of Amt Neuhaus on the opposite side.


== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
the heraldic lion of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg
the hearts of the Danish national arms (since Duke Wilhelm of Lüneburg was married to a Danish princess in the 14th century)

62,"Juan Pérez de Montalbán (1602 – 25 June 1638) was a Spanish Catholic priest, dramatist, poet and novelist.


== Biography ==
He was born at Madrid. At the age of eighteen, he became a licentiate in theology. He was ordained priest in 1625, and appointed notary to the Inquisition. In 1619 he began writing for the stage under the guidance of Lope de Vega, who is said to have assisted him in composing El Orfeo en lengua castellana (1624), a poem obviously intended to compete with Jáuregui's Orfeo, published earlier in the same year.
Montalbán's father, a publisher at Madrid, issued a pirated edition of Quevedo's Buscón, which roused an angry controversy. The violence of these polemics, the strain of overwork, and the death of Lope de Vega so affected Montalbán that he became insane; he died at Madrid on 25 June 1638. His last work was a eulogistic biography of Lope de Vega in the Fama póstuma (1636).


== Works ==
His plays, published in 1635–1638, are all in the manner of Lope de Vega. They were staged with much success, but, with the exception of Los Amantes de Teruel, achieved no permanent standing. Montalbán almost rivaled Lope de Vega in dramatic productiveness, but, according to one critic, he followed that writer's conventional manner, flimsiness in construction, and carelessness in execution too closely. Another critic called the plays other than Amantes little more than clever improvizations.
The prose tales in Sucesos y prodigios de amor, en ocho novelets ejemplares (1624) and Para todos: Exemplos morales, humanos y divinos (1632) were very popular. George Ticknor characterized “The Disastrous Friendship,” a tale in the former collection, as one of the best in the Spanish language. “Aurora and the Prince,” was translated into English by Thomas Stanley (1647).
A libellous attack on Quevedo, entitled El Tribunal de la justa venganza (1635), is often ascribed to Montalbán. Montalbán's reputation was such that sometimes his name appeared on works by other writers.

64,"Raffaele Nuzzo (born 21 February 1973) is a former Italian footballer. He spent most of his career in the Italian Serie C1 and Serie C2, in the role of a backup goalkeeper.


== Career ==


=== Internazionale ===
Born in 1973, in Monza, which at the time was in the Province of Milan (now in the Province of Monza and Brianza), Nuzzo started his professional career at F.C. Internazionale Milano, one of the major Italian clubs of the region, initially joining the team's youth side.
Since the 1992 season, he spent his career on loan at various Serie C2 clubs, as Internazionale had more experienced players as their second goalkeeper, such as Beniamino Abate, Luca Mondini, Marco Landucci and Andrea Mazzantini. He played 26 out of 34 league matches for Fasano, and his performances secured him a move to Livorno, a team with the aim of obtaining promotion to Serie C1. He played 2 matches for the Serie C2 runners-up, but the club failed to obtain promotion as they lost in the playoffs. The following season, he moved to Gualdo of Serie C1, which had finished in fifth place the previous season. Due to the departure of Davide Torchia and Oscar Verderame, he became one of the team's first choice keepers, along with the more experienced Marco Savorani. Although Gualdo finished just above the relegation zone, Nuzzo's performances earned him a place in Internazionale's first team, as third goalkeeper behind Andrea Mazzantini, but ahead of the young youth products. He was on the bench for the second leg of the club's victorious 1994 UEFA Cup Final (Beniamino Abate was on the bench for the first leg). In the 1998–99 season, Internazionale signed Sébastien Frey, which led to Mazzantini's departure from the club in the January transfer window, while Nuzzo remained as the team's third-choice keeper. He played his only match in Serie A and for Internazionale on the last matchday of the Serie A season, on 23 May 1999, when he came on as a substitute for starting goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca in the last minute of Inter's match against Bologna, with the score 2–1; the match ended in a 3–1 victory for Inter.
In June 1999, Nuzzo left for FA Premier League side Coventry City on loan, along with Antonio Caruso. Following Steve Ogrizovic's recovery from injury, who was originally the team's second goalkeeper, Nuzzo was sent back to Internazionale in November. His only Coventry appearance was one to forget. It came in the League Cup against Tranmere Rovers, as the second tier team trounced their Premier League opponents 5–1.


=== Reggiana ===
After he returned from his spell in England, Nuzzo was signed by Reggiana in January 2000. In his first season with the team, he played as a backup to Mirko Bellodi and Beniamino Abate, replacing the recently departed Alberto Maria Fontana. In his second season with the team, he played as Lorenzo Squizzi's backup. As the club also had Andrea Artich and Michele Nicoletti, he left for England again in February 2001, joining Wigan Athletic, but did not make a single first team appearance for the club.
He returned to Reggiana in the 2001–02 season, where he continued to serve as the team's backup goalkeeper, for Patrick Bettoni. In 2002–03 season, however, he played as the team's first choice keeper, ahead of Luca Mondini, making 19 appearances. The following season, however, Mondini was restored as the team's first choice keeper. In the 2004–05 season, Gabriele Paoletti succeed Mondini as Reggiana's first choice keeper, and Nuzzo played one match for the team throughout the season, which ultimately ended in relegation to Serie C2 in 2005.
In his final years with club, he finally became the team's first choice keeper, as the club had only signed the inexperienced Davide Bagnacani as an additional goalkeeper, who had recently graduated from Piacenza Calcio's youth system.
After the club lost in the promotion playoffs in 2007, Nuzzo retired from professional football, and was replaced by Marco Ambrosio and Luca Tomasig.

66,"The River Irwell ( UR-well) is a 39-mile (63 km) long river which flows through the Irwell Valley in North West England. Its source is at Irwell Springs on Deerplay Moor, approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Bacup. It forms the boundary between Manchester and Salford and empties into the River Mersey near Irlam.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irwell's lower reaches were a trading route that became part of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. In the 19th century, the river's course downstream of Manchester was permanently altered by the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896. The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and led to the development of Trafford Park which became the largest industrial estate in Europe. Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford, such as the Anaconda Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014.
The river became severely polluted by industrial waste in the Industrial Revolution, but in the second half of the 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve water quality, restock it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife. Stretches of the river flowing through Manchester and Salford have attracted large-scale investment in business and residential developments, such as Salford Quays, and other parts have become important wildlife havens. The Irwell is used for recreational activities, such as pleasure cruising, rowing, racing and fishing.


== Course ==
From its source to the confluence with the River Mersey the Irwell is about 39 miles (63 km) long. Rising on the moors above Cliviger, it flows south through Bacup, Rawtenstall, Ramsbottom and Bury before merging with the River Roch near Radcliffe. Turning west, it joins the River Croal near Farnworth before turning southeast through Kearsley, Clifton and the Agecroft area of Pendlebury. It then meanders around Lower Kersal and Lower Broughton. It bisects Salford and Manchester, joining the rivers Irk and Medlock, and then turns west toward Irlam, as part of the Manchester Ship Canal. Its course ends just east of Irlam, where it empties into the Mersey.


== Natural history ==

Until the early 19th century the Irwell was well stocked with fish and other wildlife, with people living near Manchester Cathedral using its water for drinking and other domestic purposes. However, during the Industrial Revolution, increasing levels of pollution caused by waste products discharged into the river by local industries proved fatal to wildlife, with fish stocks disappearing completely by about 1850. This situation abated somewhat during the 20th century, with a slow improvement in water quality leading to fresh populations of roach, bream and chub, and sightings of brown trout have become increasingly common.
Problems with water quality in some of the former Manchester Docks basins became apparent with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality to such an extent that the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than 30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.
Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are located close to the banks of the Irwell, near to its confluence with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, a 88 800 m² site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the predominance of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs.
Herons, cormorants, mute swans, kingfishers and many species of geese and ducks are regularly sighted on the river. The Manchester Ship Canal near Salford Quays is one of the top ten sites in Britain for diving ducks, providing a winter home to approximately 3,000 common pochard and 2,000 tufted ducks.


== Geology ==

The Irwell is all that remains of the shallow seas that covered most of south-east Lancashire in the Late Carboniferous period, when deposits of mud and sand were laid down. During the Permian and Triassic periods, red sandstones were deposited under arid, desert conditions and these became compressed into beds of shales, New Red Sandstone and Manchester marls, alternating with layers of gritstone . The glaciers of the Pleistocene period radically re-shaped the landscape and then retreated, leaving behind deposits of sand, pebbles and boulder clay that formed the fluvioglacial ridges of the lower Irwell Valley. Ashclough, a 50 800 m² site which comprises the steep banks of the river between Prestolee and Little Lever, has been designated an SSSI because of its geological interest, primarily because it is the best site in the area displaying the Ashclough marine band and its associated strata. Ashclough is a site of national importance for interpreting the coal measure palaeogeography of Great Britain.


== River Irwell catchment area ==
The River Irwell catchment area extends from the moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the catchment area is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of 1,456 millimetres (57.3 in) per annum compared to 1,231 millimetres (48.5 in) per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors at an altitude of between 350 metres (1,150 ft) and 450 metres (1,480 ft) AOD and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between 20 metres (66 ft) and 150 metres (490 ft) AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying Millstone Grit, both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The Millstone Grit is, in turn, underlain by limestone rocks from the lower Carboniferous period. The surface deposits comprise thick peat in the upper reaches, with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in the lower parts. The sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer, whilst the boulder clay is a non-aquifer. The higher, steeper slopes of the upper part of the catchment provide a large source of erodible material and debris which is transported downstream to the lower, flatter parts of the catchment. Where the channel is constricted, this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity.


== History ==

The origins of the name ""Irwell"" are uncertain but many accept the Anglo-Saxon origin, ere-well, meaning ""hoar or white spring"". Flint scrapers, knives and other materials associated with neolithic man were discovered on Kersal Moor in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There have been isolated finds of artefacts characteristic of this period along the Irwell valley, and a possible hunting site was excavated at Prestwich Golf Course in 1982, which produced a quantity of Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age flints. Neolithic tools have also been found in the River Roch near Bury and in Radcliffe, and Bronze Age burial sites have been found in Bury and Shuttleworth. The first recorded human settlements were those of the Celtic tribe, the Brigantes, who farmed the uplands and lower reaches of the river in the late iron age. In AD 79 the Roman Empire conquered these tribes, building forts at the confluences of the Irwell and the rivers Irk and Medlock and naming the town Mamucium. They also built a ford with rectangular stone blocks at Cornbrook, which is thought to be the first man-made structure to span the river. For four hundred years the Pax Romana brought peace, but their withdrawal in AD 410 left the tribes at the mercy of the Saxons, who renamed the town Manigceastre. The Danes later seized, and all-but destroyed Manigceastre, and absorbed what was left of the tribes. The Danelaw ruled until AD 920 when the Norsemen were expelled by Edward the Elder.
In the Middle Ages the town, which was now known as Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most important part of the gift was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, and even in the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.


=== 19th century ===
During the Industrial Revolution factories, mills and terraced hovels grew up along the river banks. Edward Corbett, the Borough Engineer of Salford, wrote in his 1907 book The River Irwell of his father's experiences around 1819, of seeing ""large shoals of fish, chiefly gudgeon but also other fish, rising to the flies"" from a vantage point on New Bailey bridge, (now Albert Bridge) in Manchester. Local industry dumped toxic chemicals into the river, such as gas-tar, gas-lime and ammonia water, and by 1850 fish stocks had all but disappeared. In 1860 the Irwell was described as ""almost proverbial for the foulness of its waters; receiving the refuse of cotton factories, coal mines, print works, bleach works, dye works, chemical works, paper works, almost every kind of industry."" In 1862 the Scottish geologist Hugh Miller wrote about the Irwell, in his book First Impressions: The English People, describing it as:

The hapless river—a pretty enough stream a few miles higher up, with trees overhanging its banks, and fringes of green sedge set thick along its edges—loses caste as it gets among the mills and the printworks. There are myriads of dirty things given it to wash, and whole waggon-loads of poisons from dye-houses and bleachyards thrown into it to carry away; steam-boilers discharge into it their seething contents, and drains and sewers their fetid impurities; till at length it rolls on—here between tall dingy walls, there under precipices of red sandstone—considerably less a river than a flood of liquid manure, in which all life dies, whether animal or vegetable, and which resembles nothing in nature, except, perhaps, the stream thrown out in eruption by some mud-volcano.

In the Victorian era passenger boat trips were popular but cut-short by the foul smells from the river. In 1862 the Corporation of Salford promoted an Act of Parliament enabling them to establish a River Conservancy Committee; they appointed a river inspector, and had to power to take action against anyone polluting the river. The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 was designed to solve the problems of river pollution, but it was largely ineffective. It did, however, lay the groundwork for the more draconian legislation which followed, and in 1891 the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was formed. Local authorities were ordered to provide sewage treatment facilities, and industrial concerns were told to use the best practical means of preventing pollution. Salford was one of the first authorities in the Irwell watershed to install intercepting sewers and sewage treatment works at Mode Wheel Sewage works.
One of the most famous characters associated with the river during this time was Mark Addy, who was born in a tenement on The Parsonage near Blackfriars Bridge in Manchester in 1838. Whenever anyone was in difficulty in the river, the cry would go up ""Bring Mark Addy!"" and he would race to the rescue. He was awarded a number of medals including the gold and silver medals from the Humane Society for the Hundred of Salford, and the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal. In 1878 he became the only civilian ever to be awarded the Albert Medal (first class), His final rescue was on Whit Monday in 1889, when he saved a young boy from a particularly sewage-laden section of the river. After this he became ill, and died of tuberculosis in 1890 aged 51. He had rescued over 50 people from the river during his lifetime.


=== 20th century ===

In 1939, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was superseded by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further deterioration of the river. In 1951, the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared to be replaced by the Mersey River Board, which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1965. During a 1950s television documentary entitled River of Irwell, the watercourse was described as ""The hardest worked river in the world"".
In 1946, there was serious flooding in Salford, caused by a bottleneck at a bend in the river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, the decision was made to straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.
In a question to the House of Commons in 1950 the Member of Parliament for Rossendale, Mr. Anthony Greenwood, highlighted the lamentable condition of the Irwell and one of its main tributaries, the River Roch:

Today I am afraid that fish in most of those rivers are virtually extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and looks down at the noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that ""melancholy stream""... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: ""The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal."" The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: ""There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold."" The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.

In 1951, it was announced that flood defence works were to be carried out on the stretch of the river passing through Lower Broughton between Cromwell Bridge and Gerald Road Bridge, although local property owners and shopkeepers were outraged at being asked to bear part of the cost. Work on the 8-foot-thick (2.4 m) concrete wall did not get underway until June 1952 and was still only nearing completion when, in August 1957, nearby homes were threatened by flooding during heavy rain.


==== 1970s ====

A report in the Manchester Evening News in 1971 stated that Bury Angling Society had signed an agreement with Bury Corporation giving them fishing rights along four miles (6 km) of the river between Summerseat and Radcliffe. The secretary of the society was quoted as saying:

Extensive tests have been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are satisfied that the water will support fish life. Roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing. It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.

The report went on to state that the society ""intends to carry out stocking operations soon"". In 1972 the newspaper reported that ""tiddlers"" (small fish) had been seen swimming in the ""notorious inky Irwell"" near Peel Park, Salford. The Deputy chief water quality officer for Salford, Mr. Eric Harper, said:

Ten years ago, any fish getting as far down as Salford would have been killed almost immediately by the pollution in the water. Although the river there is now a great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will probably not be able to live long. These had probably got into the main river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. But I think it is real progress.

Mr Harper went on to say that the Irwell had been well stocked with fish along its whole length 100 years ago but refused to guess when it would reach the same state again. In 1974 all of the river authorities were merged into the Regional Water Authorities. In the 1974 annual report of the North West Water Authority (NWWA), it was said that the river ""once internationally famous, or infamous as the epitome of river pollution, is now in a much better state as compared with its condition at the time of a special survey carried out nine years ago."" This was reported in an article in The Manchester Evening News on 26 October of that year which stated that:

During nine years of pollution control work reviewed by the North West Water Authority, the biggest improvement had been in the Bolton District, where effluent from five dilapidated sewage plants and two paper mills were now being treated at the Ringley Fold Works [but] there has been little reduction in pollution from the river Roch. At Bacup the headwater of the Irwell is discoloured by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is being done to stop the ochre seepage. Fish do exist in the stretch between Rossendale and Bury and fish are to be introduced in stretches between Radcliffe and Manchester. However, it is feared that it will be many years before fish will be able to breed freely in the river. 


==== 1980s ====
In 1980, a scheme for improving a section of the river between Littleton Road and Adelphi Weir in Salford for boating purposes was included in Greater Manchester Policy Committee's capital programme for 1981/82. County Councillors at a recent committee meeting had criticised the condition of the river, with the councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham calling it ""quite revolting and horrible"". A spokesperson for the NWWA said that, although the river had a reputation for being polluted, it was getting much better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied. She added that tests were being carried out to show the improved cleanliness of the Irwell and that 600 trout had recently been put in the river at Summerseat, near Bury. The proposals were welcomed by both Salford University and Agecroft Rowing Club, with the university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race. Later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted along the banks of the Irwell between Broughton and Pomona Dock in a £650,000 ""green finger"" scheme to ""bring the countryside into the heart of industrial Salford"". The dossier outlining the scheme, prepared by Salford's Technical Services Officer, emphasised the ""bleak character"" of the Irwell Valley with ""many constructions by the river that are decaying and rotting"" and said ""the main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into the water upstream."" The report recommended that ""even more support should be given to the NWWA in their pollution control of the River Irwell.""
Throughout the 1980s, sightings of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre were reported in local newspapers. In February 1981 the Manchester Evening News reported that ""ten jacksharps [sticklebacks], about two inches long"" had been spotted by a site manager working on the Mark Addy public house, which was then being built on the disused New Bailey Landing Stage, below New Bailey Street, on the border of Manchester and Salford. Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. In 1983 over 100 canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could ""transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester"". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16 km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still ""a class 4 river – top of the pollution chart"". During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187 proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches on the side of the river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8 km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre ""mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford – the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000 new jobs over the next 10 years"". The Manchester Ship Canal Company also announced a £70 million redevelopment scheme for Pomona Docks in Salford, to include a marina, homes, offices and other commercial developments.


==== 1990s ====

In 1990, the newly formed Mersey and Irwell Packet Company launched regular tourist trips along the river from a landing stage opposite the Granada Studios Tour entrance in Quay Street, taking in the stretch from Castlefield to Salford Quays. This was not universally welcomed as, by September of that year, a retired chemical engineer claimed that the pleasure boat was ""leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on the river bed"". However, in 1991 a feature article appeared in the magazine Lancashire Life extolling the virtues of the cruise, and stating that the Irwell ""once thought a liability is in fact a major asset to urban regeneration ... now the twin cities compete to befriend her, to dress her in finery and proudly introduce her back into society. And the public are cordially invited back onto her waters."" During 1994, construction work began on a new £1.3M footbridge to link Manchester and Salford, to be known as Trinity Bridge. The box-girder and steel cable construction was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava to represent a ship in full sail as the centrepiece of the £50M Chapel Wharf Regeneration Scheme, which was expected to breathe new life into a run-down area of Salford and to create up to 8,000 new jobs. In May 1995 a new 30-mile (48 km) long multimillion-pound arts trail, to be known as the Irwell Sculpture Trail, was reported in the Manchester Evening News and in June 1997 work began on the £10 million Lower Irwell Valley Flood Defence Scheme in Lower Kersal.


=== 21st century ===

In July 2000 there was a setback for the clean-up programme when a pollution incident affected approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) of the river between Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom, causing the death of more than 36,000 fish. The large number of fish killed, however, did serve to illustrate how much the river had improved from the lifeless, ""melancholy stream"" of the 1950s. In 2005 a £1M project to make the river ""the cleanest it has been for decades"" was announced by United Utilities. The improvements included fitting filters on sewers in Lower Broughton to ensure litter was not washed into the river, as part of a scheme to improve overflows across Adlington, Wigan, Chorley, Rochdale and Bury. Then in October 2008 United Utilities announced that work on the Ringley Fold Wastewater Works in Stoneclough, to be completed by the end of the year, should increase the number of fish in the river and ""massively improve the environment locally so walkers, canoeists and anglers will all reap the benefits."" The company said that this was to be the biggest scheme that they had undertaken in the region, and the project manager was quoted as saying:

""Reducing the amount of phosphate in the water is the main driver behind the scheme. New legislation states that the amount of phosphate in waste water should be one milligram per litre because it causes water to clog with algae and reduces the amount of oxygen in the water, which results in less aquatic life and fish.""

The treatment plant, which was built in the 1930s and last updated in the 1970s, treats waste water from a population of half a million, from Bolton, Prestwich, Whitefield and Clifton.
There was another pollution incident in March 2008 when twenty miles of the river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution at a cost of £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.


== Commerce ==


=== Mersey and Irwell Navigation ===

In the late 17th century, the Warrington businessman Thomas Patten had made the River Mersey navigable as far as Warrington and suggested that there would be significant commercial value in extending this along the Irwell as far as Manchester. In 1721, Parliament authorised the alteration with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act, and by 1736 work had been completed by creating eight canal locks along the 20-mile (32 km) route from Warrington to Manchester, allowing access to boats of up to 51 tonnes. The waterway, which became known as the Mersey & Irwell Navigation, played a central role in the cotton industry of the 18th century that spearheaded the Industrial Revolution.


=== Bridgewater Canal ===

When Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater built the Bridgewater Canal, the task of crossing the Irwell was one of the main obstacles he faced. The solution was to build a canal-carrying bridge across the river, the first barge aqueduct in England. The aqueduct, which opened in 1761, measured 12 metres (39 ft) high and 200 metres (656 ft) long, and became one of the wonders or the age. The Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Bridgewater Canal competed for trade to and from Manchester for the next 120 years and specially designed barges with a shallow draft, known as ""Mersey flats"", were used on both waterways. Over the years both trade and rivalry continued to grow with each company offering reduced freight charges or special rates and concessions to gain business from the other. The most important cargo carried was raw cotton from Liverpool to Manchester but timber, dyewoods, pig iron, lead, copper, nails, tar, sand, grain and flour were also carried. Passenger services had been operating on the Bridgewater Canal for some years and in 1807 the Irwell and Mersey Navigation Company began to compete with daily services between Runcorn and Manchester. In 1816 they began to use packet steamers. However, in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened; packet boat services went into decline, and ceased to operate completely in the 1860s. In Manchester two other canals used the Irwell as a point of access: the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal from 1809, and the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal from 1839. The previous year, the short Hulme Locks Branch Canal had also connected the Irwell to the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield. All are now non-navigable, although the first is under restoration.


=== Manchester Ship Canal ===

As the 19th century progressed, the increasing need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues charged by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which was at the time the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began. The canal, which was made by greatly deepening and widening the eastern section of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, opened on 1 January 1894. It reduced the shipping costs of raw cotton to the mills and the dispatching the finished cloth overseas. The canal had helped the region to become the centre of the Industrial Revolution, and it had transformed Manchester into England's third largest port, despite being 40 miles (64 km) inland. As the canal was built, it became clear that Brindley's famous aqueduct would have to be demolished, as it allowed insufficient headroom for the freighters that the canal would carry. Fortunately, in 1896 the councillors of Eccles paid to have the aqueduct moved to the spot it occupies today, alongside the canal. The Bridgewater Canal is now carried over the Manchester Ship Canal by the equally celebrated Barton Swing Aqueduct, which was completed in 1893 with the novel idea of ""opening"" by rotating 90 degrees to allow ships to pass.
The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks led to the development of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.


== River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme ==

The lower reaches of the Irwell have flooded many times in its history, the most well documented being the floods of 1866, 1946, 1954, 1980, 2007 and 2015. In December 1816 rapidly thawing snow caused the river to flood, sweeping away a considerable amount of property including building materials and livestock. Locals reported the height of the river to have been almost as great as a more serious flood of 1768. A local public house, the Black Boy, suffered extensive damage as the water caused the rear wall to collapse, a local brewery was flooded with the loss of all its stock, and a Mersey Flat came free of its moorings, hitting Regent Bridge. In 1866, the ""year of the great Flood"", rain fell for three continuous days commencing on Tuesday 13 November. By the end of the first day, the river had risen 14 feet (4.3 m) above normal at Peel Park, street lamps could not be lit and mills were brought to a stop. In all, £1 million of property was damaged, 450 hectares of land was flooded, 700 people had to be rescued from wrecked homes, but only one man died by drowning. The height of the flood was marked by an obelisk erected in Peel Park. The construction of the ship canal is said to have reduced the risk of flooding, by providing a larger outlet below Regent bridge. In 1946 in Salford 5,300 properties were flooded, and 600 were flooded in 1954.
To alleviate such problems two flood storage basins with a capacity of 650,000 cubic metres (850,000 cu yd) have been constructed to the west of Littleton Road, Kersal, at a cost of around £11 million. As part of the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme, the defences help to protect some 3,000 properties in Kersal and Lower Broughton against a 1 in 75 year flood. Concerns have been raised that a 1 in a 100-year flood would breach these defences and cause some £55 million damage to property. The defences proved successful on 22 January 2008, when the worst flooding to hit the region in thirty years caused the Irwell to burst its banks further downstream in the centre of Manchester.
In March 2015 work began on a £12m upgrade to the flood defence scheme to upgrade the protection to cope with a 100-year flood. The scheme, which was due to be completed in December 2015, involves creating a flood storage basin to the north of the Castle Irwell student village. An area of 29 hectares will be excavated and the material will be used to construct a 3 metre high embankment around the site.


== Regeneration ==

A large urban regeneration project, The Salford Quays Development Plan, was published in 1985 and work began a few years later to redevelop the site for residential, business and leisure purposes. The Salford Quays waterside development has made living by the Irwell, and the Manchester Ship Canal into which it flows, fashionable once again.
There are further plans to ""turn the tide on the years of neglect and once again embrace the River Irwell as a fundamental part of Manchester and Salford's heritage and future economic and social growth. The vision is to reinvent the central Manchester conurbation as the major waterfront destination in Northern England."" A number of key stakeholders are involved in the development of this regeneration vision. These include Manchester, Salford and Trafford councils, Manchester Ship Canal Company, Environment Agency, Mersey Basin Campaign, local businesses, landowners, community groups and the wider Manchester, Salford and Trafford communities.


=== Irwell City Park ===
In 2007 Manchester City Council, Salford City Council and Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council prepared planning guidance to support the delivery of a project for the restoration of the river and creation of a new urban park, to be called Irwell City Park. The intention is to develop 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) of riverside between The Meadows and Peel Park in the north, through Salford and Manchester city centres, Ordsall and Pomona Dock areas, around to Salford Quays and Trafford Wharfside. The three authorities formally adopted the draft Planning Guidance in March 2008. The Guidance sets out the guidelines that the councils will use as a material consideration in determining applications for planning permission and other matters in the Irwell City Park area. It also establishes a set of principles to ensure the provision of a continuous riverside cycle/walkway, and the high quality design of new public open spaces and other infrastructure. An application is to be made to the North West Development Agency in October 2008 to support pre-project implementation work, including design and technical feasibility work.


== Sport on the Irwell ==
Rowing has existed along the river in Manchester and Salford since 1823. A regatta was inaugurated on 12 September 1842 on a straight course from Throstle's Nest Weir to Regent Road Bridge. Racing continued in Manchester with events such as Agecroft Regatta and Warburton Regatta. At the turn of the 20th century, rowing was very popular in the area with many local clubs such as Nemesis, Prince of Wales, Minerva, Didsbury and Agecroft all competing regularly. With the decline in the condition of the water, by the Second World War only Agecroft and Broughton rowing clubs were still active.
Agecroft Rowing Club was formed in 1861, making it one of the oldest open membership rowing clubs in the world. The club was originally based in the grounds of Agecroft Hall and then a short distance downstream at Littleton Road. However, the river became impossible for eight's and fours to pass due to the encroachment of weeds and river life following the clean up of the environment. The club now operates from a boat house next to the Salford Watersports Centre at Salford Quays, which it has shared with the University of Salford Boat Club since 2004. The boat house, which the sport's governing body, British Rowing, has nominated as the North West Centre of Excellence, also hosts the Two Cities Boat Race, which has been held on the river since 1972.
This river is home to the Salford Friendly Anglers' Society, the oldest angling society in the world, founded in 1817.

70,"Progressive southern gospel music is music that is written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. Progressive southern gospel is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of gospel music and southern gospel.
Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of progressive Southern gospel varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme, as with most Christian music, is praise, worship or gratitude to God and/or Christ.


== Origins ==
Progressive southern gospel is an American music genre that has grown out of southern gospel over the past couple of decades. The style can trace its roots to groups like The Nelons in the 1980s, who appeared regularly on events with traditional Southern gospel groups despite their sound which was called ""middle of the road"" at the time.
Current progressive southern gospel is characterized by its blend of traditional southern gospel instrumentation with elements of modern Country and pop music. Hints of other styles are frequently employed in the mix as well. In some progressive Southern gospel, you can hear a touch of Cajun, Celtic, Bluegrass, or even Southern rock.
Where traditional southern gospel more often emphasizes blend and polish, progressive southern gospel tends to be presented with a more emotional tone. Vocalists are known for experimenting, stretching, scooping, slurring, and over accentuating melodies and diction.
Lyrically, progressive southern gospel songs are patterned after traditional southern gospel in that they maintain a clear evangelistic and/or testimonial slant. In many cases, lyrical content and/or Country diction are the only elements separating a progressive southern gospel artist from a pop oriented, contemporary Christian music artist.


== Impact of The Gaither Homecoming Series ==
In the early 1990s, songwriters Bill and Gloria Gaither developed an enterprise known as The Gaither Homecoming Series. This did much to introduce progressive southern gospel to the masses. Through video and television distribution many progressive southern gospel artists such as The Martins, The Hoppers and The Isaacs became household names. The series has also taken these groups to such places as Ireland, Sydney, London, and South Africa, not to mention almost every major U.S. city for live concerts.


== Artists ==
Several groups have made progressive southern gospel their genre of choice. One of the most popular and outstanding of these are The Crabb Family. With origins that go back to the country gospel genre this group has now become one of the leaders in progressive southern gospel and has even crossed over to contemporary Christian as well.
Another group that has made a huge impact on the progressive southern gospel genre would be The Isaacs. This group is deeply rooted in Bluegrass gospel but over the last decade has erupted onto the progressive scene with such hits as ""Friend To The End"", ""Stand Still"", ""Carry Me"" and the a capella spiritual ""I Have A Father Who Can"".
Other artists in the progressive southern gospel genre include The Talley Trio, The Jody Brown Indian Family, Keith Caldwell, The Hoppers, and The Martins.",en,Progressive southern gospel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_southern_gospel
71,"The Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra (Croatian: Dubrovački simfonijski orkestar) is a professional musical orchestra from the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia and the chief musical representative of the Dubrovnik region. In its work it carries on with the musical history started in the earlier Republic of Dubrovnik (then Ragusa).


== History ==
Music in Dubrovnik advanced with the support of the most affluent nobility. The first musical groups were formed to perform concerts in celebration of the city's patron, Saint Blaise (locally Sveti Vlaho). For these performances only the most talented musicians were selected.
As the number of musicians in the Republic increased, the Senate decided to introduce qualified professors who could teach music to the youth. Apart from teaching, these professors played in the orchestra Knez's Music (Croatian: Kneževe glazbe). Musical influence during this time mostly came from the Italian city states, so the professors during this time were mostly from Italy. Young musicians extended their musical education most often in the ciies of Naples and Rome.
In modern times, an orchestra was formed on August 25, 1925 under the name Dubrovnik Philharmonic Orchestra. The first symphony concert was held in the Marin Držić Theatre under the Polish conductor Tadeusz Sygietynski, then the conductor of the Warsaw Opera company. Reviews of the performance were good, and the activities of the orchestra were soon financed by the local government.
Over the years the orchestra changed its name several times. In 1946 it took on the name Dubrovnik City Orchestra. In 1992, it began to work closely with the Dubrovnik Summer Games and changed its name to the Dubrovnik Festival Orchestra. The current name was adopted in 1995.
Over the years many well-known conductors and performers have played with the orchestra: Lovro von Matačić, Zubin Mehta, Kirill Kondrashin, Ernst Märzendorfer, Henryk Szeryng, Mstislav Rostropovich, Antonio Janigro, Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrakh, Sviatoslav Richter and others.


== Present ==
The orchestra regularly performs at the Dubrovnik Summer Games. Its repertoire includes many of Dubrovnik's 18th century classics, especially those of Luka Sorkočević and Ivan Mane Jarnović. The orchestra also holds concerts in the atrium of the Rector's Palace, as well as performing around Croatia and internationally.

72,"The Anderson Platoon (French: La Section Anderson, released in 1966 in Europe, 1967 in the US) is a documentary feature by Pierre Schoendoerffer about the Vietnam War, named after the leader of the platoon - Lieutenant Joseph B. Anderson - with which Schoendeorffer was embedded. Two decades later, a sequel was released as Reminiscence.


== Background ==
In summer 1966, France Soir news magazine director and French public channel ORTF producer Pierre Lazareff proposed that war reporter and director Pierre Schoendoerffer complete the ""unachieved"" war documentary Schoendoerffer began in 1954.
Back in May 1954, Schoendoerffer was covering the First Indochina War for the French army's cinematographic service SCA. At the siege of Dien Bien Phu, he filmed the battle between the French Union forces and the Viet Minh, but his reels were captured when he surrendered to the enemy.
After the departure of the French forces from Vietnam in 1956, the U.S. Army replaced it several years later and fighting soon flared again, at the beginning of the Vietnam War.
Arguing that ""the war was the same, the French only switching with the Americans"", Lazareff convinced the French veteran to return to Vietnam as a kind of second chance to complete his war documentary.


== Plot ==
The French war cameraman and First Indochina War veteran Schoendoerffer (38), already famous for his celebrated masterpiece The 317th Platoon (1965), returns to Vietnam.
On 1 August 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division (United States) is sent to South Vietnam. The following year in September, Schoendoerffer joins it and follows a 33-man platoon of GIs led by Black West Pointer Lieutenant Joseph B. Anderson (24) until October 1966.


== Reception ==
The Anderson Platoon has been shown in more than 20 countries and won several prizes, including an Oscar on April 10, 1968 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.
1967: Prix Italia for Original Dramatic Program
1968: Emmy Award for the Best Documentary Film of 1967
1967: Academy Award for Documentary Feature
1968: Merit Award (BBC)


=== Anderson's comments ===
Some time after the film was released, Captain Joseph B. Anderson, Jr., the leader of the 1st Cavalry Division, U.S. Army after whom the film is named, commented on the film (and on his other experiences in Vietnam and in the military, in general) in Wallace Terry's book Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans (1984).
He observed, on page 227:

""After visiting different operations around the country, both army and Marine, he settled on the 1st Cav because of the new approach of our air mobility, or helicopter orientation. And he wound up with my platoon because of its racial mix - we had American Indians and Mexican-Americans, to - our success in finding the lost platoon, my West Point background and ability to speak French. He and the film crew stayed with us day and night for six weeks, filming everything we did. They spoke very good English, and I didn't speak good enough French. And Schoendoerffer had as much knowledge and experience about the war as any of us.

The film would be called The Anderson Platoon. And it would make us famous.""

On page 230, Captain Anderson discuses the death from friendly fire of a white soldier named Shannon, from California, who is introduced in the film at approximately 6'50"". Anderson states: ""I did write a letter to his folks, telling them he did an exceptionally good job. I did not describe the circumstances under which he was killed, because we were directed not to put those kinds of details in letters whatever the case may be."" He continues: ""The film describes the grenade as an enemy grenade. Which is not the real circumstances.""
On page 233, Captain Anderson notes: ""I spent my last months in the base camp at An Khe, an aide to the commanding general. Being featured in The Anderson Platoon had obviously helped my career.""

The sports programs at West Side CTC were cut due to a budget shortfall.


== Controversy ==
In the past, The Wyoming Valley West School district adopted a dress code, and soon after WSCTC also adopted a similar dress code. This was due to corruption in the school board, as there is corruption over the entire geographical area of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Not long after, the two representatives from Wyoming Valley West wanted more control over the WSCTC school board, as most of the students and funding comes from the WVW school district. It was said that if they did not get the control they wanted, they would pull out of WSCTC's partnership and discontinue sending their students, as well as discontinuing funding. This caused an uproar from the students and parents, because they were concerned their children would not receive the education they are entitled to by U.S. Law. A protest of students, parents, and alumni was held at a school board meeting, and soon after things did not work out in WVW's favor.
Wyoming Valley West has since decided to rejoin the JOC due to the extreme overpayment to the tech center.

75,"Christopher Anton Knight (born November 7, 1957) is an American actor and businessman. He is known for playing Peter Brady on the 1970s series The Brady Bunch. He has since gone on to become a successful businessman and enjoyed a semi-resurgence in the public eye with television appearances in the 2000s. His father, Edward Knight, was also an actor.


== Early career ==

After the end of his Brady Bunch appearances, Knight's acting career consisted mostly of making guest appearances on other television shows (Happy Days, The Love Boat), and occasional film roles (Just You and Me, Kid, Curfew, Good Girls Don't, The Doom Generation, and Nowhere). He reunited with his former Brady costars in the holiday TV movie A Very Brady Christmas (1988). Before the Brady Bunch series, he had had some small television roles, including an appearance on the first season of Mannix, in a 1967 episode called ""Coffin for a Clown"".


=== Computer career ===
In 1988, Knight, a self-described ""geek"", left acting to pursue a business career in the computer industry. He got a job as an accountant sales manager for Martec, Inc. and landed that company's first million-dollar sales deal within his first 18 months on the job, for which he was named Employee of the Year. In 1989, he was named Vice President of Design System Marketing and Sales at New Image Industry.
In 1991, he co-founded Visual Software, a pioneering 3D graphics company. In 1995, he founded Kidwise Learningware, a company that manufactures interactive educational products. In 1996, he joined the keyboard manufacturer Adesso, and in 1997, he became Vice President of Marketing at iXMicro, a video hardware company. In 1998, he founded his own TV tuner company, Eskape Labs; it was purchased by Hauppauge Computer Works in 2000.


=== Return to television ===
On April 17, 1994, Knight lost his professional wrestling debut in a ""Dark Match"" at the Spring Stampede in Chicago at the Rosemont Horizon. His adversary was another child star from 1970s television, the Partridge Family's Danny Bonaduce.
Knight appeared on a special episode of The Weakest Link that featured The Brady Bunch cast members squaring off against each other. Knight won the show and donated the proceeds ($49,000) to his selected charity, Zero Population Growth.
Continuing to pursue TV opportunities, Knight appeared on VH1's fourth season of The Surreal Life. The show garnered Knight more attention than he had received in quite some time, in part because he appeared shirtless on the show, revealing a well-built body. During his stint on the show, he began a romance with a castmate, model Adrianne Curry, winner of America's Next Top Model cycle 1, who is almost 25 years younger than Knight. After the show, the two moved in together and got engaged, as documented on the VH1 series My Fair Brady, which premiered on September 11, 2005. The series was renewed for another season, and the couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois, on May 29, 2006, in a Gothic-style wedding.
Knight was featured in Click Five's music videos for ""Just the Girl"", in which he played a high school teacher, and for ""Catch Your Wave"", as the hotel manager.

Knight and former Brady Bunch co-star Barry Williams appeared in a 2006 episode of That '70s Show, in which he and Williams portrayed a gay couple who moved in next door. The two have remained close friends since their Brady Bunch days, and Williams appeared several times on My Fair Brady. Florence Henderson, who played Carol Brady, Susan Olsen, who played Cindy Brady, and Mike Lookinland, who played Bobby Brady, also appeared in an episode of My Fair Brady. In one episode, Knight expressed how important it was for Curry to accept his close relationships with his former Brady Bunch co-stars.
Knight participated in VH-1's retrospective miniseries, I Love The '70s: Volume II. He, his family, and friends appeared on the season finale of NBC's Celebrity Family Feud on July 29, 2008. During the 2008–09 television season, Knight hosted the syndicated game show, Trivial Pursuit: America Plays. He has hosted a series of Jonathan Goodson-produced game show specials for the Michigan Lottery, Make Me Rich. The first special was scheduled for October 16, 2009, with a second scheduled for February 2010.


== Personal life ==
Knight proposed to Adrianne Curry on the season finale of My Fair Brady, on VH1, which aired on November 6, 2005. The show was renewed for a second season that began in June, 2006, and focused on the couple's wedding preparations. The couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois on May 29, 2006, in a gothic-style wedding. In a September 2007 episode of the talk show Dr. Phil dealing with large age gaps in relationships Curry and Knight appeared to discuss their marital issues with Phil McGraw. McGraw predicted that their style of arguing, particularly Knight's hurtful comments, was a strong predictor of impending divorce in couples. Knight's manager, Phil Viardo, told a celebrity gossip website on May 29, 2011, that Knight and his wife, Curry, were announcing their separation. The date was the couple's fifth wedding anniversary. On February 2, 2012, on G4's Attack of the Show, Curry said the divorce had been finalized. He married his fourth wife, Cara Kokenes, in November 2016.

He started work for Angang/Anshan Iron and Steel Group working at Qidashan mine, just north of Anshan. He was noted for his diligence and commitment to work, as well as his philanthropic works. These included attending his work two hours early every day for 15 years, many blood donations, campaigns to find bone marrow donors for children with leukemia and donating significant amounts of money to fund poor children's education, despite his own low earnings. He continues to live with his family in a single room, 40 square metre apartment that he first moved into in the 1980s. He has been offered improved accommodation but passed it up so that other colleagues could get better housing. For these acts, from 2010 onwards he has received many national level awards.
In 2011, a movie biography of Guo Mingyi was produced. The movie was directed by Chen Guoxing and Wang Jing, with the lead part played by Hou Yong and supporting parts by Jiang Hongbo, Li Qin and Feng Yuanzheng.
Guo is an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; he is ranked close to the end of the list of alternate members, which is ranked by number of confirmation votes received at the 18th Party Congress. His elevation to the Central Committee was notable in that he had no political or business experience prior to his joining the elite committee. In 2013, he was named a vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.


=== The ""Father-like Smile"" Gaffe ===
On Oct 23, 2013, Guo Mingyi posted on Sina Weibo describing an encounter with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of Communist Party and president of China. In the post he used the phrase ""smile like an affectionate father"" (慈父般的笑容) for Xi. The post raised a lot of attention and mockery because Xi is only 5 years his senior. Guo removed the phrase afterwards.

77,"Plectrohyla miahuatlanensis, or the Sierra Miahuatlan spikethumb frog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to Mexico and only known from its type locality near Candelaria Loxicha on the Sierra de Miahuatlán (part of Sierra Madre del Sur) in Oaxaca.


== Taxonomy ==
A revision of the family Hylidae from 2016 places this species in the genus Sarcohyla, but this classification is not yet widely adopted and as of late 2016, the Amphibian Species of the World labels it as ""provisional"". It belongs to the ""Plectrohyla bistincta group"" with the genus Plectrohyla, all of them moved to Sarcohyla in the 2016 revision. It is similar to Plectrohyla cembra and Plectrohyla sabrina.


== Description ==
The holotype, and the only known specimen, is a female that measured 42.5 mm (1.67 in) in snout–vent length. The coloration is distinctive: the dorsum is dark green, hidden surfaces are dark brown, flanks are yellow flanks, and canthal mask and lateral reticulations are dark brown. There is a yellow stripe that separates the dorsal from the ventral coloration on the limbs and above the cloaca. The fingers and toes are long and have large ovoid discs; webbing between the fingers is vestigial and slightly more developed between the toes.


== Habitat and conservation ==
The species' habitat is mesic pine-oak forest; a single female frog was found in late afternoon, inactive between the leaves of an arboreal bromeliad at 2,550 m (8,370 ft) above sea level. Other amphibians found at the locality were salamanders Craugastor mexicanus and Bolitoglossa oaxacensis and frogs of the Exerodonta sumichrasti group.
The area of type locality was covered with relatively intact forest at the time the holotype was collected in 2001. However, many slopes of the Sierra de Miahuatlan have been at least partially cleared for agriculture.

78,"Dogpatch USA is an abandoned theme park located in northwest Arkansas along State Highway 7 between the cities of Harrison and Jasper, an area known today as Marble Falls. It was opened in 1968, and was based on the comic strip Li'l Abner, created by cartoonist Al Capp and set in a fictional village called Dogpatch.
Dogpatch USA was a commercial success in its early years. Investors tried to parlay that success into a sister park, ""Marble Falls,"" planned with a ski resort and convention center. The venture failed and led to the park's closure in 1993. The property fell into disrepair. In August 2014, the park was purchased by Bud Pelsor and a business partner, who announced plans to restore the park and eventually re-open it. Beginning in December 2014, Pelsor opened the park to visitors for several events; these were the first occasions on which the park was open to visitors since its 1993 closing. In March 2016, Pelsor's business partner wanted to sell his share of the park, so the park was put up for sale again; however, Pelsor said he would be happy to maintain half-ownership in the park and sell the other half to a new business partner.
A forthcoming documentary about Dogpatch USA is currently in production by Jeff Carter Productions. Release date is unknown at this time.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
In 1966, Albert Raney, Sr. decided to sell his family's Ozark trout farm and listed it with O. J. Snow, a Harrison, Arkansas real estate agent. Snow examined the property and decided that the Raney farm was ideal for an amusement park based on pioneer themes, which was an idea he had entertained for years. He noted that features of the area resembled those pictured in the Li'l Abner comic strip: he imagined Mill Creek Canyon at the base of a 55-foot (16.8 m) waterfall could be the ""bottomless canyon"" featured in the comic strip, and the nearby tourist attraction Mystic Caverns (also owned by the Raney family) could become ""Dogpatch Cave"", where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed by a few unsavory Dogpatch characters.
Snow and nine or ten Harrison businessmen formed Recreation Enterprises, Incorporated (REI) to develop the land. Their first step was to get permission from Al Capp, the creator of Li'l Abner, for a park based on his work. According to an Arkansas Gazette article, Snow sent Capp home movies of the property and descriptions of the attractions. In addition to the trout farm and Mystic Caverns cave, Snow planned a variety of attractions and activities, including horseback riding, paddle boats, train rides, local arts and crafts shops, family-oriented theatrical presentations, a botanical garden, an apiary, and honey and fudge shops. Li'l Abner comic-strip characters who would roam the park and perform skits for the patrons. Snow also assured Capp that the park would be quiet and dignified and would not include roller coasters or thrill rides that would conflict with the rustic Li'l Abner theme. Capp, who had turned down other offers to use his characters in theme parks, accepted this one and became a partner, claiming he had once driven through the Ozarks and had pictured just such an area for the setting of his fictional ""Dogpatch"" town. On January 4, 1967, an article in the Northwest Arkansas Times stated that Capp's attorneys were finalizing the agreement. Capp approved of the plans for the park and granted REI the rights to use his characters.
Some state officials and Arkansas residents objected to the creation of the theme park because they thought that it would encourage negative hillbilly stereotypes. Lou Oberste of the Publicity and Parks Commission expressed reservations, and Commission Director Bob Evans agreed that Arkansas had difficulty shedding a similar image created by comedic actor Bob Burns.
In January 1967, Edwin T. Haefele of the Brookings Institution and Leon N. Moses, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University, were in Arkansas attending the Central Arkansas Urban Policy Conference. When reporters asked for their opinions of the Dogpatch project, they expressed doubts about the likelihood of its success, citing the failure of other theme parks that had popped up trying to replicate Disneyland's great success. They also felt that such theme parks tend to cause nearby property values to deflate and local businesses to relocate to more desirable areas. Despite these reservations, the Publicity and Parks Commission toured the property and decided to support the project, and the Harrison Chamber of Commerce approved the plans for the 825 acre (3.3 km2) park. In comparison, Disneyland originally called for only eight acres.


=== Building and opening the park ===
Al Capp and his wife attended the ground-breaking ceremony on Tuesday, October 3, 1967. Phase I of the project, at a cost of $1,332,000, included construction of the initial buildings and rides. A second phase, which included the construction of a train from Dogpatch to Marble Falls, a tram from the parking lot to the park entrance, the ""Skunk Hollow"" section of the park, a motel, and a golf course, was planned to be completed over the next two years at a cost of $2,000,000. In 1968, the name of the community post office was officially changed from Marble Falls to Dogpatch.
Under the direction of Jim Schermerhorn, an REI board member and experienced caver, Mystic Caverns, which was renamed ""Dogpatch Caverns"", was completely renovated. Dangerous conditions were corrected to ensure safety, and the additions included a better lighting system, walkway, and entrance. During renovation, while Schermerhorn was operating the bulldozer, a second cave was discovered next to Mystic Caverns. Realizing the potential value of this pristine cave, he had it blocked off so that it could be preserved untouched. It was named ""Old Man Moses Cave"" and put on the ""to do"" list along with the other projects intended for Phase II. Schermerhorn also acquired several authentic 19th century log cabins in the Ozark Mountains and had them dismantled, shipped, and reconstructed in the park. A watermill that had originally operated on the property circa 1834 was restored and made fully operational.
Dogpatch USA opened and welcomed about 8,000 visitors on May 17, 1968. The centerpiece of the park was a giant statue of the fictional town hero, Jubilation T. Cornpone. Capp unveiled the statue during his dedication speech to a crowd of about 2,000. Kim Capp, son of Al Capp, worked as the assistant Public Relations Director. General admission was $1.50 for adults and $0.75 for children. During the first year, the park's attractions included a railroad, surrey rides, trail rides, a stable, an apiary, a grist mill tour, a slide, a petting zoo, and a ""mule swing."" Fishing in the trout pond was another activity offered; the Dogpatch restaurant could then cook the trout for visitors. Artisans demonstrated their work, including candlemaking, glassblowing, and woodcarving, and local crafts were available for purchase, including handmade dulcimers, smoking chips, and embroidered aprons, though crafts produced elsewhere supplemented the local products. The ""alpine-style"" Dogpatch Inn provided accommodations for visitors. The park reported a net profit of about $100,000 at the end of the 1968 season.
Attendance expectations for the park were, in retrospect, extremely optimistic. David Wesley and Harrison Price of the Los Angeles consulting firm Economic Research Associates projected 400,000 patrons in the first year. They projected that within 10 years, annual attendance would exceed 1 million and annual revenue would be $5 million. However, Dogpatch USA hosted only 300,000 visitors in 1968. Estimates of attendance in its subsequent years have varied widely. According to a February 9, 1997 article in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, it never reported more than 200,000 visitors in any subsequent year. However, according to an August 10, 1997 article in the same newspaper, ""in the early 1970s, the park was attracting almost a million visitors each year.""


=== Jess Odom ownership ===
A disagreement arose among the members of REI with regards to investing the profits of the first year. Snow believed all the profits should be reinvested in the park, but the other members wanted to divide some of it among themselves. Jess Odom, an Arkansas businessman in search of an opportunity, bought REI members' shares for $750,000 and gained a controlling interest in the park in October 1968. Odom had been successful in several other endeavors, including the founding of a planned community northwest of Little Rock called Maumelle. In summer 1968, there were plans to expand the park further in time for next season's opening; the planned attractions were the ""Skunk Holler"" section, new shops, and more Li'l Abner-themed performances.
Odom signed a long-term licensing agreement with Capp, giving the park and any future Li'l Abner franchises the rights to use all characters, events, jargon, names, and titles until 1998. In return, Capp would receive two to three percent of the gross of admissions over the same time period.
According to some sources, in 1969, the cave discovered during construction, ""Old Man Moses Cave,"" was opened to park visitors. However, according to Mystic Caverns' owners, the Old Man Moses Cave was never opened to the public while it was part of Dogpatch, USA. Also in 1969, the first annual Miss Dogpatch pageant was held in the park. During that time, Orval Faubus, former governor of Arkansas, served as the president of Dogpatch, USA. Also in 1969 the B-movie 'It's Alive!' was partly filmed at the Dogpatch Theme park.
1969 marked a particularly popular year for rustic and hillbilly pop culture. Shows such as Green Acres, Petticoat Junction, and The Beverly Hillbillies were in vogue on American television, and a similar rustic-themed park just a few miles away near Branson, Missouri, Silver Dollar City, had become a huge success. The Li'l Abner comic strip was appearing in more than 700 newspapers daily throughout the country, which kept the fictional town of Dogpatch in the public eye. In 1968, Al Capp had granted New York restaurant chain Longchamps, Inc. the rights to use his characters and artwork in a planned Li'l Abner-themed restaurant franchise. Capp had also approved the creation of a Li'l Abner TV series, and the Dogpatch, USA operators hoped the park and series would mutually build each other's audiences.
Dogpatch USA was profitable in its first few years, and Odom expanded the park's amenities. By the 1970 opening day, a motel consisting of 60 mobile-home units had been completed, and a funicular to carry guests from the parking lot to the park entrance was a few weeks away from completion. In 1971, Odom, who foresaw unlimited potential for the park, bought out most of the remaining investors for $700,000 and became, essentially, the owner. Several new attractions were added in time for the 1972 season opening, including an ""Animal World"" section with a sea lion exhibit and an aviary with exotic birds, a children's water ride, and, as stated by the Harrison Daily Times, a ""unique boat train ride.""
In August 1972, Odom announced that he was financing the construction of a sister park, Marble Falls Resort and Convention Center, which was the first ski resort in Arkansas. The two parks were marketed together as a year-round attraction. The resort was ready for the Christmas season of 1972, though a winter storm prevented it from opening until after Christmas. The resort used snow machines to produce enough snow for skiing; the anticipated skiing season was December to mid-March. Marble Falls Resort and Convention Center included ski slopes, a toboggan run, an ice-skating rink, the 62-unit Marble Falls Inn, 36 condominiums, and 30 rental alpine chalets, though the condos and chalets weren't completed until after the initial opening. Odom also opened the Antique Auto Museum as part of the Marble Falls complex.
Odom also continued to expand Dogpatch, USA. New attractions during the 1973 season included a go-cart track named Pappy Yokum's Positively Petrifying Putt-Mobiles, a scrambler called Joe Btfsplk's Impending Disaster Machine, a shooting gallery called Scraggs Feudin' Range, a black light maze, and a swinging bridge. The Kissin' Rocks sculpture was also newly installed for the 1973 season. In 1974, more new attractions were added, including the thrill ride Hairless Joe's Kickapoo Barrel, an inflatable ""bouncing bag,"" a replica Native American village, and craft shops where artisans demonstrated pottery making, leather working, and woodworking.
Success seemed to be on the horizon for Odom and Dogpatch USA, but the many unforeseen events of the 1970s cast a dark shadow on Odom's dreams. Attendance figures throughout that decade were woefully short of expectations. In 1973, interest rates began to skyrocket, and a nationwide energy crisis kept many tourists home. In a bout of cancellations nicknamed the Rural purge, American television networks eliminated many shows with country themes, and the popularity of hillbillies waned. The Li'l Abner restaurant chain was never built. The proposed Li'l Abner TV series was never made; a pilot was produced and premiered as a television special on ABC-TV, but it received poor reviews and no network purchased the series.
The mild winter weather which visited Arkansas through the mid-1970s proved to be the undoing of Marble Falls as a ski resort, and its snow cannons and slopes sat idle much of the time. The modest profits of Dogpatch USA were not sufficient to keep the two parks afloat, and Odom, already $2 million in debt, was forced to borrow an additional $1.5 million in the unfavorable financial atmosphere of 1973.
In 1974, Odom partnered with the Department of Speech and Dramatic Arts at the University of Arkansas to create an in-park repertory theater in a venture called ""Arkansas Rediscovered"" or the American Revolution Bicentennial Project. The group of student performers was named the ""Boar's Head Players."" Odom and the university planned for the group to perform well-known plays and short children's productions and to develop new plays based on the history and culture of Arkansas. They planned for the new plays to premiere at Marble Falls in 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial celebration, and then the group would tour the state performing the new works. This venture turned into a huge disappointment; the group presented two of the five promised productions, and did not return for any of the following seasons. Today, this troupe is still active at the University of Arkansas.
In 1976, Union Planters Bank began foreclosure proceedings on $3.5 million in debts. In 1977, Al Capp and the Li'l Abner comic strip retired. Capp's retirement brought an end to one of the greatest advertisements for Dogpatch USA – the Li'l Abner comic strip. The same year, First National Bank of Little Rock began foreclosure proceedings on $600,000 in debts. In September of that year, Odom stated that, because Marble Falls had lost $50,000 to $100,000 a year since it opened, the ski slopes would be closed permanently. In subsequent years, various activities, including grass skiing, a gaming arcade, a 400-foot water slide, and a disco, were advertised at Marble Falls along with the resort accommodations. New attractions included the Slobbovian Sled Run, Grist Mill Puppet Theater, Rottin' Ralphies Rick-o-shay Rifle Range, and Barney Barnsmell's Skunk-works. New attractions in 1978 included Li'l Abner's Space Rocket, which was intended to simulate a flight into space.
Two personal injury lawsuits, seeking more than $200,000 in compensation, were brought against Dogpatch USA in 1979 and settled in 1980. By 1979, Dogpatch USA's income was less than its operating expenses, and attempts by Odom to get the town of Harrison, and later Jasper, to issue tourism bonds to refinance millions of dollars of debt were unsuccessful. That same year Odom announced that negotiations had been underway to sell the park to a private nonprofit group called God's Patch, Inc., which would turn Dogpatch USA into a Biblical-themed amusement park, but funding never materialized. New attractions in 1980 included a trained bear act, Castle's Country Bears, and the Shmoo, a character from the Li'l Abner comic strip, which appeared for the first time among the park's costumed characters.
The heat wave of 1980, one of the worst in Arkansas's history, made that year one of the worst for the park and marked the second consecutive year that Dogpatch USA operated without sufficient income. In October 1980, Union Planters Bank filed to take possession of both Dogpatch USA and Marble Falls. A month later, Dogpatch USA filed for bankruptcy. Union Planters Bank put Dogpatch USA up for sale in order to pay off $7 million' worth of loans.


=== OEI ownership ===
In 1981, Ozarks Entertainment, Inc. (OEI) bought Dogpatch USA for an undisclosed amount; it would retain ownership through 1986. Taking the park in new directions, OEI, under the leadership of General Manager Wayne Thompson, reduced the park staff by more than 50% and added many attractions. The amphitheater hosted concerts featuring stars such as Reba McEntire, Hank Thompson, and Ike and Tina Turner.
Thompson also brought in the corporate sponsorship of Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, and Tyson Foods, and superheroes including Spider-Man, Batman and Robin, and Captain America for personal appearances and autograph signing. Gospel and bluegrass shows were presented. Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse from the popular TV series The Dukes of Hazzard) was signed as the park's spokesman both onsite and in TV commercials. Dogpatch admission was relatively cheap compared to other theme parks around the country; a Money magazine survey in 1986 found that admission for a family of four was $34 at Dogpatch, while it was $84 at Disney World.
In 1981, Dogpatch Caverns and Old Man Moses Cave were sold to Bruce Raney (grandson of Albert Raney, Sr.) and a fellow investor. Old Man Moses Cave was renamed ""Crystal Dome"" and ""Dogpatch Caverns"" became ""Mystic Caverns"" again. According to Mystic Caverns' owners, the Crystal Dome was subsequently renovated and opened to the public for the first time in August 1981. Managed by Raney until they were sold to Omni Properties, Inc. in 1984, the twin caves continue to operate as tourist attractions.
In the 1980s, the ownership of Marble Falls was divided and changed until it became so entangled in legal problems that it was impossible to clearly identify who actually owned each part of the property. In 1982, Odom, under the name ""Buffalo River Resorts,"" began selling parcels of the resort for timeshares and condominiums; however, in June 1983, The Arkansas Time Share Act made it illegal to sell the timeshares because the banks held liens on the property. A 1984 court ruling created an exception for Buffalo River Resorts, although buyers had to be informed that the banks held liens on the property and thus could hypothetically repossess the timeshares if Odom's companies failed to pay their debts. This was followed by a drop in timeshare sales.


=== Telcor ownership ===
In 1987, The Entertainment and Leisure Corporation (Telcor) purchased a 90% stake in OEI. The other 10% was retained by Herb Dunn, Lynn Spradley and Jerry Maland, residents of the area. Telcor, a corporation formed to buy and manage theme parks and headed by Melvyn Bell of Bell Equities, owned two other parks at the time, Deer Forest Park in Coloma, Michigan and Magic Springs in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Wayne Thompson, who was general manager of the park, became President of Telcor with Sam Southerland as Vice President. Thompson and Southerland were principal owners of OEI, and Southerland actually managed the finances for all three Telcor parks. Under Thompson's leadership Telcor made renovations and improvements, and a new ride called the ""Space Shuttle"" was added.

In 1988, Wayne Thompson departed, and Lynn Spradley, a Dogpatch USA veteran of 14 years, became GM and managed the park through the 1991 season. During this time Spradley bemoaned the fact that Dogpatch USA was forced to spend much more per patron on promotional strategies to attract visitors than other theme parks, and that most kids did not know who the Li'l Abner characters were. By this time the comic strip had been out of print for more than 10 years.
Dogpatch USA floundered in the face of stiff competition in the Telcor years, especially from Silver Dollar City, which duplicated most of what Dogpatch USA offered but on a grander scale, and was an hour's drive to the north. What Silver Dollar City lacked, the Ozark Folk Center (a fully subsidized state park) in nearby Mountain View provided, and neither park was wrapped in an outdated cartoon franchise.
In 1991, after concerns from civic leaders that the park would not open for the 1991 season due to financial problems, it was indicated that if the park opened at all, it would open as a scaled down arts and crafts park. General admission was eliminated; patrons paid for each individual attraction instead. Telcor decided to save the money that the Capp estate was receiving for use of the name and characters, and with that one of the most distinctive aspects of the park—the Li'l Abner theme—was completely dropped and the name changed to Dogpatch, Arkansas.
The park was closed permanently on October 14, 1993.


== Post-closure ==

Security Bank of Harrison foreclosed on the Dogpatch, USA property in order to recover $485,000 in debt from park owner Melvin Bell. On December 20, 1994, the park was put up for auction on the courthouse steps in Jasper. The auction was handled by Jim Sprott, a Harrison lawyer whose wife Jan had been ""Daisy Mae"" at Dogpatch USA from 1968 through the 1970 season; Sprott himself had played Earthquake McGoon and Luke Scraggs. C.L. and Ford Carr of Leisuretek Corporation and Westek Corporation received a quit claim for the property. At that time, however, they neglected to do anything with the park.
In 1997, in response to a petition by residents, the U.S. Post Office changed the name of the Dogpatch Post Office back to Marble Falls, as it had been prior to 1968.
In late 2002, Ford Carr had the 141-acre (0.57 km2) site placed on eBay with a minimum bid requirement of $1 million. Although he was looking for a $4 million bid, there were no bidders. In 2005, it was reported by Arkansas Business that the property was for sale with an asking price $5 million, but the price was ""very negotiable.""
In 2005, 17-year-old Pruett Nance was driving an ATV through the property. Nance said he had permission from the owners to tour the property. While riding, Nance collided with a length of wire strung between two trees, and was severely injured and nearly decapitated. The question of whether or not the wire was put there maliciously, to dissuade vandalism, became the subject of a lawsuit the Nances filed against the park's owners. The suit eventually ended up in the Arkansas Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Nance. Nance was awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages, and his father, Stewart Nance, was awarded $400,000 in compensatory damages, for medical bills. When the park owners did not pay the judgment, the deed to Dogpatch was awarded to Pruett Nance, who became the new owner of the park.


=== Revitalization of Marble Falls ===
In 1988 Debra Nielson began buying parcels of the Dogpatch property. Eventually the area she owned included the ski lodge, convention center, roller rink, and motel. She renamed the acreage ""Serenity Mountain"". She moved into the Ski Lodge and operated a bed and breakfast there. She also opened a nondenominational church in one of the abandoned resort buildings. In December 1999 Nielson leased the abandoned skating rink to the Humane Enforcement and Legal Protection or HELP. HELP was a non profit group that provided therapeutic horse back riding free of charge.
A few businesses have revived sections of the Marble Falls property. Nielson sold some of the property to Fred Mullins, who opened an RV Park on the site of the former campgrounds. In 2004, Nielson sold another portion of the property, including the convention center, motel, restaurant, ice-skating rink, and a strip mall to Bob Richards and Randal Phillips. Phillips and his wife Debbie reopened it as ""The Hub"", a motorcycle-themed resort. The Hub features a 50-room hotel and a convention facility that seats 1,500 in theater style.


=== Bud Pelsor ownership ===
On August 13, 2014 what was left of the park was sold again, this time to Charles “Bud” Pelsor, the inventor of a ""spill proof"" dog bowl, and his partners for $2 million. Pelsor, who had recently purchased much of the surrounding land, announced that he planned to reopen the park as an ecotourism village. On December 8, 2014 the park was opened to the public for the first time since it closed 21 years earlier. That weekend, over 5,000 visitors toured the property in anticipation of a grand opening date in the future. Pelsor's plans included restoring the stream, trout farm and mill, featuring music performances, and opening a restaurant. The reopened park, he said, would be named the Village at Dogpatch.
Three buildings burned on the Dogpatch Grounds on February 22, 2015; the buildings were a total loss. Newton County, Arkansas officials have deemed the incident ""suspicious"". No one was reported to be injured in the blaze.
On May 16 and 17, the park was opened to the public for a second time. Several music groups performed, and artisans from around the Ozarks demonstrated and sold their crafts.
After several more events in 2015, in March 2016, Pelsor put the park up for sale for $3 million, explaining that his business partner, James Robertson, wanted to sell his share of the park, but Pelsor could not afford to buy him out. Pelsor said he would happy to remain co-owner by selling just half the park to a new business partner.


== Attractions ==
Trout Pond - Park visitors could rent fishing equipment and go fishing in the pond, which was deliberately overstocked so it would be easy to catch fish. Visitors could fish as much as they wanted and only had to pay for the fish they caught. The Dogpatch restaurant could prepare and serve guests' caught fish, or Dogpatch workers could clean and pack the fish in ice for guests to take home.
The pond was part of a trout farm that was operated by Albert Raney and his family beginning in the 1930s. In 1966, Raney sold the Trout Pond to the developers of Dogpatch USA, but the Raneys continued to operate the pond.
Dogpatch Caverns - A nearby show cave that was incorporated into the park. It had been a tourist attraction since the late 1920s, and in 1949 it was purchased by the Raney family and named Mystic Caverns. It was sold to the developers of Dogpatch USA in 1966, who renamed it ""Dogpatch Caverns."" The cave was renovated and many safety issues were addressed. During renovations, a second cave was discovered next door; it was named ""Old Man Moses Cave"" after a Li'l Abner cartoon character, and barricaded to preserve its pristine condition. According to some sources, ""Old Man Moses Cave"" was open to visitors in the 1969 season. Both caves were sold in 1981. ""Dogpatch Caverns"" was renamed ""Mystic Caverns"" once more, ""Old Man Moses Cave"" was renamed ""Crystal Dome,"" and, according to the current owners of the caves, it was at this time that ""Old Man Moses Cave"" was finally opened for tours.
Peter Bella Grist Mill - This was a historic mill originally built on the property in 1834. It was restored during the initial construction of Dogpatch in 1968. It fell into disrepair after the park's closure.
West Po'k Chop Speshul- This was a miniature train with passenger cars. It carried guests on a circular track around the park. At the time of its construction, it was the first and only railroad in Newton County, Arkansas.
Cornvention Center - This was a venue where musical performances were given.
Frustratin' Flyer - This was a steel Wild Mouse roller coaster. It was a ""Monster Mouse"" model manufactured by the Allan Herschell Company. Installed in 1968 for the park's debut, it operated until 1991. Dogpatch USA brochures after 1973 continued to show a Monster Mouse in operation. The mouse was sold between the 1991 and 1992 season.
Earthquake McGoon’s Brain Rattler - This was a toboggan roller coaster by Chance Rides. The ride was part of the park when it was opened in 1968. In early brochures it was depicted as being a track wrapped around an enormous tree, but the ride was actually made of metal. Since 1993, the ride has operated as the Wild & Wooly Toboggan at Little Amerricka amusement park in Marshall, Wisconsin.
Funicular Tram - A ""decliner inliner"", the tram was used to transport visitors from the parking lot into the park below. It was purchased from an unknown manufacturer in Switzerland and shipped to Dogpatch USA at a cost of $250,000. Installed in 1970 and opened at the beginning of the 1971 season, it could transport 1,700 guests per hour at a speed of 13.5 feet per second (4.1 m/s). As passengers descended into the Dogpatch USA valley they were given a short monologue about the park over the tram's PA system.
Boat Train Ride - This ride was introduced at the beginning of the 1972 season. A motorized lead boat piloted by a Dogpatch employee pulled a train of non-motorized boats behind it. The boats followed a route going up creek to the Grist Mill and back again.
Hairless Joe's Kickapoo Barrel - This ride was introduced in the 1974 season. It was a rotating thrill ride.
Barney Barnsmell's Skunk Works - This was introduced in 1977. It was a building full of complicated contraptions reminiscent of Rube Goldberg's designs. The machinery's purpose was the production of homemade soap; the Springfield News-Leader referred to the attraction as the ""Skunk Works Soap Factory.""
Slobbovian Sled Run - This was introduced in the 1977 season. Guests rode on sleds mounted on teflon runners. The sled run was intended to operate similarly to a waterslide but without water.
Li'l Abner's Space Rocket - The ride was added in 1978. It was a simulated trip into outer space.
Trash Eaters - The park had trash cans equipped with huge animal heads that ""ate"" (sucked) the trash out of patrons' hands. The heads were shaped like goats, pigs, and even razorbacks, and the unusual design encouraged patrons to properly dispose of their litter by making it an amusing experience. The trash eaters used an unusual design. There was a blower motor inside the trash eater ""house."" The inside of the ""house"" was sealed so that when the door was shut, a vacuum was created which sucked trash into the trash eater's mouth. The trash then hit a stop and fell into the trashcan located inside the trash eater ""house"".
Dogpatch Cabins - Guests could tour several cabins that were the ""homes"" of various Li'l Abner characters. These included Mammy and Pappy Yokum's house and Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae's house. Some of the cabins were authentic cabins from elsewhere in the Ozarks that had been purchased and rebuilt at the park during its 1968 construction.
Dogpatch Auto Drive - These ""antique"" cars were gas powered, 5/8 size, model T cars made by Arrow Development. This ride was part of the park when it opened in 1968. There were 7 cars in total (two red, two yellow, and three white). The track was made of asphalt with wooden railings around the track. On Oct. 26, 2015, a local family from Bergman, AR purchased all 7 cars from an independent seller. The new owners are restoring the cars and plan on keeping them together in the Harrison, AR area. The cars are occasionally on display at local events.

79,"Cant de la Senyera (""Song of The Senyera [flag]"") is a composition for mixed chorus with music by Lluís Millet, lyrics based on a poem by Joan Maragall, composed expressly to be the hymn of the Orfeó Català choral group in the Catalonia community of Spain. It debuted at Montserrat in 1896, in a ceremony in honor of the Senyera, a traditional flag of the crown of Aragon which serves as the basis for other regional flags, including that of Catalonia.


== Prohibition ==
The song was prohibited from 1939 to 1960 under the regime of Spanish caudillo Fracisco Franco, as part of Franco's ban on Catalan language and culture. In 1960, while Franco was on a rare visit to Barcelona, four of his ministers, including Minister of the Interior Camilo Alonso Vega, attended the centennial ceremony for Maragall at the Palace of Catalan Music. The Civil Governor of Barcelona, Felipe Acedo, had authorized the concert, but forbade the playing of the ""Cant"" despite its being based on Maragall's work. The orchestra played a musical arrangement of Cant de la Senyera, upon which a number of Catalan nationalists stood up and sang along, marking a key turning point in the history of Catalan nationalism, a happening known as the Fets del Palau de la Música (""Events of the Palace of Music""). Several people were arrested for singing along, and one, Jordi Pujol, who would later become President of Catalonia, was arrested, tortured, and sentenced to seven years in prison.


== Role ==
The song served as a de facto Catalan anthem, alongside ""Els Segadors"", though the latter was only made official in 1993.

81,"The Coffin Quilt is a novel by Ann Rinaldi that was first published in 1999. Set in Kentucky, it tells the story of the Hatfield-McCoy feud in the late 19th century through the eyes of Fanny, a young female member of the McCoy family. Choosing between family and what is right is one of the major decisions Fanny McCoy has to make. When the McCoys decide to wage a war against a rival family, the Hatfields, things start to get out of hand; four of her brothers are killed by Hatfields.


== Plot ==
Rinaldi tells the story of the Hatfield-McCoy feud in the late 19th century through the eyes of Fanny, a young female member of the McCoy clan. Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, Rinaldi illustrates the fervent code of honor in the mountains of Kentucky and West Virginia as her protagonist struggles to understand the superstition and loyalty fueling the cycle of violence in Tug Valley. In the end, Fanny must choose between her family and her future to escape the feud.
When Fanny’s sister, Roseanna, the “purtiest girl in the county,” has an affair with Johnse Hatfield, the slow brewing hatred between the Hatfield and the McCoys erupts. As the families take the law into their own hands through dubious pacts and midnight raids, Fanny follows her sister Roseanna into a nest of secrets. Pregnant and estranged from her lover, Roseanna sews a coffin quilt to preserve the family members so quickly disappearing from Tug Valley. Fanny disapproves of the quilt despite her loyalty to her sister and evolves from innocent bystander to judicious dissenter as the violence escalates. With the help of her mysterious “Yeller Thing,” Fanny learns to overcome the petty hatred plaguing both families.

89,"Peter M. Halloran is the founder and CEO of Pharos Financial Group, an investment firm active in global markets since 1997. The firm was established with initial investment capital from Credit Suisse and Soros Fund Management. In 2014, Pharos added a Dallas-based investment arm, Titanium Exploration Partners LLC, to invest into U.S. Oil & Gas opportunities. Altogether, Halloran has brought over $10 billion to the markets in which he invests. He was awarded Hedge Fund Manager of the Year in 2010 by Hedge Fund World, and his Pharos Gas Investment Fund and Pharos Russia Fund have been both ranked among top-15 global performers by Bloomberg. He has never gated an investment, suspended an NAV or re-set a high water mark. In 2011, Halloran established the physical oil trading firm, Pharos Energy Ltd., which was then sold in 2014. In 2000, Halloran acquired a stake in Aton Capital Group and subsequently transformed it into a top emerging markets investment bank that was later sold to UniCredit Bank for $424 million.
Halloran played an important role in the development of the Russian capital markets in the 1990's through equity, debt, and private placements while also guiding Russian politicians and local exchanges to work around outdated Soviet-era laws to enable the Russian capital markets to develop. In early 1994 he acquired nearly 10% of all outstanding privatization vouchers and, in 1995, Halloran pioneered the first foreign investments into Russian treasury bills (GKO's) and restricted shares of energy giant Gazprom. In 1996 and 1997 Halloran arranged more than $2 billion of privatization bids for Russian and Ukrainian companies. In 2002, he led the first IPO of a domestic company to be listed on a Russian exchange. Prior to establishing Pharos, Halloran built and managed the CIS brokerage and proprietary trading businesses of Credit Suisse in Moscow. Earlier he was based in New York with CS First Boston, Salomon Brothers and Morgan Grenfell. He has also acted as an Advisor to Soros Fund Management.
Halloran is the grandson of Dr. Orvan W. Hess who was a noted U.S. physician and a recipient of the American Medical Association's Scientific Achievement Award for pioneering the development of the fetal heart monitor and his earlier work helping to introduce penicillin to the U.S. His mother, Dr. Katherine Hess Halloran, is a published research physician who conducted early genetic research into the chromosomal cause of Down Syndrome.
Halloran graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1984) and attended the University of Texas School of Law.

91,"Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology is an anthology of slipstream fiction, edited by James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel, published in 2006 by Tachyon Publications.


== Contents ==
Feeling Very Strange seeks to define the slipstream genre as well as present the foremost examples of it. The editor's foreword consists primarily of attempts to define the genre, and the stories are interspersed with a series of essays and arguments from other authors and commentators, under the heading ""I Want My 20th Century Schitzoid Art"".


== Reception ==
Feeling Very Strange has received mixed reviews, with most of the negative responses stating that they were unconvinced of the viability of slipstream as a legitimate subgenre. The review on The SF Site was particularly concerned with this element, stating that ""stylistic variations among the selections don't help to clarify exactly what slipstream is."" A review in Strange Horizons expressed further concern with the definition given, stating that ""slipstream is not a genre (and) a slipstream anthology risks seeming arbitrary in its selections. Even if it's a form on its way to becoming a genre, ""slipstream"" can be seen as an imperialist coinage, a land-grab by the ghetto."" It went on to note, however, that ""the quality of the stories in this book, with a couple of exceptions...is not in doubt. Publishers Weekly made a similar proviso, stating that ""While these intriguing stories (and accompanying essays) may not be enough to define the canon of a new subgenre, they provide plenty of good reading."" Susurrus Magazine were less qualified in their praise, stating that ""though it's hard to define exactly what is happening, it's a pleasure to read.""

93,"The New Mutants is an upcoming American horror film in the superhero genre, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is intended to be the eleventh installment in the X-Men film series. The film is directed by Josh Boone from a screenplay by himself and Knate Lee, and stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga, Blu Hunt, and Alice Braga. In The New Mutants, a group of young mutants held in a secret facility fight to save themselves.
Boone and Lee first began work on the film after Boone completed The Fault in Our Stars, the pair having been fans of the New Mutants growing up together. They pitched a potential film trilogy to X-Men producer Simon Kinberg, and in May 2015 were officially signed on to the film. Taylor-Joy and Williams were rumored to be cast in March 2016, and were confirmed over a year later when the rest of the cast began to fill out. Filming took place in Boston from July to September 2017, primarily at Medfield State Hospital. The film is inspired by the works of Stephen King and John Hughes.
The New Mutants is scheduled to be released on April 13, 2018.


== Premise ==
Five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.


== Cast ==
Anya Taylor-Joy as Illyana Rasputin / Magik: a Russian mutant with sorcery powers, who ""uses teleportation discs to travel."" She is the sister of Colossus, a member of the X-Men seen in previous films in the series.
Maisie Williams as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane: a Scottish mutant ""struggling to reconcile her religious beliefs with her power to turn into a wolf.""
Charlie Heaton as Sam Guthrie / Cannonball: a Kentuckian mutant ""who can propel himself into the air and is invulnerable while doing so.""
Henry Zaga as Roberto da Costa / Sunspot: a Brazilian mutant ""with the ability to manipulate solar energy.""
Blu Hunt as Danielle Moonstar / Mirage: a Native American mutant ""who has the power to create illusions drawn from the fears and desires of a person's mind.""
Alice Braga as Cecilia Reyes: a mentor to the group, and a medical doctor ""who has the ability to generate a protective bio-field around herself.""


== Production ==


=== Development ===
After completing work on the 2014 film The Fault in Our Stars for 20th Century Fox, director Josh Boone created a comic book with Knate Lee using panels from Chris Claremont's New Mutants comics to illustrate what a potential film trilogy adapting those comics would be like. The pair, best friends since childhood, had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling their stories ""really dark, interesting, and different from the typical X-Men stories that we had read."" They took the comic to Simon Kinberg, one of the producers of the X-Men film series, who ""really liked it""; in May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone direct The New Mutants, from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and Lauren Shuler Donner producing. The film would be a standalone spinoff film, expanding the universe of the X-Men films.
Updating the status of the film in March 2016, Kinberg said that Boone and Lee were working on the script, and that, like Deadpool, the film would be different from the core X-Men films, ""maybe not as different as Deadpool, but it has its own unique, original voice to it."" Kinberg said that the film would have a young adult ""vibe"", and that there was potential for characters seen in previous films to appear, namely Warpath, Sunspot, and Professor X, who all have ties to the New Mutants in the comics. Also at that time, it was reported that Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy were being looked at to star in the film as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane and Illyana Rasputin / Magik, respectively. The rest of the title team was expected to consist of the characters Sam Guthrie / Cannonball, Roberto da Costa / Sunspot, and Danielle Moonstar / Mirage. Sunspot previously appeared in X-Men: Days of Future Past, portrayed by Adan Canto, who was not confirmed to be returning for the new film. James McAvoy, who portrayed Professor X in several previous X-Men films, was said to have a significant role in this one, alongside Alexandra Shipp, who was expected to reprise her role of Storm from X-Men: Apocalypse.
In May 2016, Kinberg confirmed that the script included Professor X, and stated his hope for filming to start at the beginning of 2017. By that August, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who had worked with Boone writing The Fault in Our Stars, were also working on the script for The New Mutants. The title team's roster had also expanded to include the character Warlock. Boone explained that he brought Neustadter and Weber onto the film to write a new draft of their script while he and Lee were busy on another project. In November, the report of Williams and Taylor-Joy's casting was believed to be accurate, and Nat Wolff was being looked at for the role of Cannonball after working with Boone on The Fault in Our Stars. The character Demon Bear was set as the film's main antagonist, with the project aiming for more of a ""'Stephen King meets John Hughes'-style horror movie."" Boone soon noted that the Demon Bear was a very personal villain for him as a child, as he ""was raised by very religious parents. They were Evangelical Southern Baptists and they believed in the rapture; they believed the devil was real; they believed in demons.""


=== Pre-production ===
The film had entered pre-production in Boston, Massachusetts by April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city. Location scouting had been taking place, including at Medfield State Hospital, which was previously used as a filming location for Shutter Island. Fox scheduled New Mutants for an April 13, 2018 release. Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams, and was ""making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors"" for the cast, widely searching for a South American to play Sunspot and a Native American to play Moonstar. By then, Kinberg was producing the film with Karen Rosenfelt; McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film; and Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball.
At the end of May, Henry Zaga was expected to be cast as Sunspot, and Rosario Dawson—who also portrays the Marvel character Claire Temple across the various Marvel Netflix television series—was in talks to join the film as Cecilia Reyes, a mentor to the title group. It was explained that McAvoy was no longer involved due to Professor X being written out of the script with further drafts, and Shipp's Storm had likewise been written out of the film. Additionally, Boone confirmed that the film would be ""a full-fledged horror movie set within the X-Men universe. There are no costumes. There are no supervillains. We’re trying to do something very, very different."" He was particularly influenced by Bill Sienkiewicz' time as artist on the New Mutants comic, which he called, ""a darker and more surreal and impressionistic X-Men series than we’d ever seen before."" Boone had previously stated that he does not like horror films, except for ""classic ones"" such as The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining, but was looking to ""pioneer and champion doing prestige versions of horror films"" based on his love for horror novels such as King's works. At the end of the month, Charlie Heaton was in talks to portray Cannonball.
At the start of June, Zaga, Dawson, and Heaton were confirmed to have been cast, and newcomer Blu Hunt was cast as Moonstar after an extensive and challenging international search that prioritized ""ethnic authenticity"". The character was believed to be central to the Demon Bear storyline that the film focuses on. At the end of that month, Dawson exited the film, and Alice Braga was cast as Reyes in her place. Boone created storyboards with artist Ashley R. Guillory to plan out all of the shots before filming.


=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under the working title Growing Pains. Peter Deming served as cinematographer for the film. The majority of the film was shot on location at Medfield State Hospital, where Boone said ""every single person on my crew ... had weird things happen to them while they were there."" Boone wanted to create ""as many of the effects practically as we could. It has some big visual effect stuff as well, but we really tried to do everything we could possibly do real so it would feel a little bit more like"" the horror movies that he grew up with. For instance, to create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, Boone used the technique originated by Wes Craven of having real actors pushing on sheets of spandex. 10 percent of the film was shot using green screen. Filming completed on September 16, 2017.


=== Post-production ===
After filming wrapped on The New Mutants, Fox chairman and CEO Stacey Snider compared the setting of the film to a ""Breakfast Club detention/Cuckoo’s Nest institutional setting"", and described the genre of the film as ""a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven’t seen a superhero movie whose genre is more like “The Shining” than “we’re teenagers let’s save the world."" Boone said, in October 2017, that A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors was also an influence on the film. He confirmed that it is set in modern day; clarified that Warlock was not in the film, but could appear in a sequel; and said that the Demon Bear would not be the main antagonist of the film, just that ""it's very much inspired by that run on the comics.""


== Release ==
The New Mutants is set to be released in the United States on April 13, 2018.


=== Marketing ===
The first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on Friday the 13th. Sara Vilkomerson of Entertainment Weekly felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of X-Men film, and was ""creepy"". Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall""; the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song. Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V. Club, also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a ""straight-up horror film"", and said, ""Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre."" Writing for /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a bottle episode for the X-Men franchise, and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for Deadpool. Bui also compared the trailer's tone to Stranger Things, and Braga's performance as Reyes to Nurse Ratched.


== Future ==
Boone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy. In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and Karma would appear in the sequels, which he wanted to be ""their own distinct kind of horror movies. [The first film] is certainly the 'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie. The next one will be a completely different kind of horror movie. Our take was just go examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film. Drawing from the big events that we love in the comics."" He added that connections to the wider X-Men universe could be explored more in future films.

94,"The story of Little Muck is a fairy tale written by Wilhelm Hauff. It was published in 1826 in a collection of fairy tales and tells the story of an outsider called Little Muck.


== Frame story ""The Caravan"" ==
The fairy tale is embedded in a frame story called ""The Caravan"": the participants of a caravan tell each other stories, as they do not want to get bored. One of the participants is a young businessman called Muley. He tells the story of Little Muck.


== Plot of the fairy tale ==
As a child, Muley knew a small outsider called Little Muck, who also lived in his home town Nicea in Turkey. Little Muck lived alone in a house, which he rarely left. Due to his misshapen figure and his unsuitable clothing Muley and his friends always made fun of him. One day, they were extremely mean to him. Thereupon Muley’s father gave Muly 50 blows with a pipe stem. After the first 25 blows he told him the following story:
Muck’s father Mukrah was a well-respected, but poor man, who lived as lonely as his son. He was ashamed of Muck’s misshapen figure and therefore he did not allow him any kind of education. When Mukrah died, his relatives inherited everything, as he owed them a lot of money. Muck only got a suit with wide trousers, a wide belt, a coat, a turban and a knife.
His father was tall and thus Little Muck cut off the legs and sleeves of the wide trousers without changing the width. Afterwards he left his home town to seek his fortune. Shorty afterwards Muck found an accommodation and a new job in another town: he had to take care of the cats and dogs of a mysterious woman called Miss Ahavzi.
One day Muck entered a forbidden room in Miss Ahavzi's house and accidentally destroyed an expensive bowl. He took two items of this room and decided to flee, as he did not get his wages and was often punished for no reason. These two items had, as it turned out, magical powers: With the pair of slippers, he could not only walk faster than any other person, but also fly to any place he wanted. And the walking stick showed him buried treasures.
The king was impressed by Muck's magic slippers, and thus offered him a position as a courier, which made the other servants jealous of him. With the help of his magic walking stick, Muck discovered a forgotten treasure in the palace garden one day. As he wanted to make new friends, he distributed all the gold he had found to other people. However, he was charged with theft and sent to prison.
At that time the official punishment for stealing royal property was death. However, Little Muck could save his life by telling the king more about the magic power of the slippers and the walking stick. Thereupon the king tried on the slippers, but as Muck did not show the king how to stop the slippers, the latter ran and ran until he passed out. He was very angry, confiscated the magic items and chased Muck away. After an eight-hour march, Little Muck finally reached the border of a small country.
By chance, he discovered two fig trees in a forest. With the help of the figs he could retaliate: the first variety of figs caused the growth of huge donkey ears and a long nose; by eating the second variety of figs, it went back to normal. Dressed up as a salesman Little Muck smuggled the first variety of figs on the king's table. Shortly afterwards he dressed up as a scholar and offered the king the second variety of figs as a remedy for his and his royal court’s deformities.
After proving the effectiveness of his cure, the King led Muck into the treasury, where he should choose a reward. He immediately snatched his magic items and revealed his identity. With the help of his magic slippers Little Muck flew back home and left the disloyal king with his deformed face behind. Since then, he lived in his home town in great prosperity, but lonely as he despised other people.
""Muck became wise through experience and therefore he deserves admiration instead of mockery"", Muley's father ended his narrative and spared his son the remaining half of the blows. Muley told Muck's story to his friends, who were very impressed by the story of Muck's life. From this day forth they honored Muck and bowed before him whenever they saw him.


== Interpretation ==
The father tries to explain to his son that it is superficial to judge people only by their looks. Little Muck is still a respected man, even with his grotesque appearance. Nevertheless, he remains an outsider, which marks a great difference to other fairy tale figures with magic items. Even though the fairy tale takes place in the Orient, the here described ruling system is to be understood as criticism of the countries of the German Confederation: due to its small size Little Muck is able to leave the country on foot within eight hours, he does not even have to make use of his magic slippers. Similar to the Duke in Dwarf Nose, the King displays an incompetent ruler: after being tricked by his courtiers he seizes the magical items and expels Little Muck from the country. The latter consequently takes revenge by using the figs. Due to the hierarchy, the King eats most of them, and is thus punished even harder, because Little Muck denies to give him the curing variety of figs. Based on this tale, Muley and his comrads become better persons. Thus the fairy tale is a parabel about the desired impact of literature.

95,"Netherton is a residential area of the city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom. For electoral purposes it forms part of Peterborough West ward.
Netherton means lower farm in Old English, but the area was named after the Netherton Building Company which built the original houses in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Thorpe Primary school is located in the area; secondary pupils attend Jack Hunt School. Jack Hunt swimming pool is located here. It is a 25m (82 feet) dual-use facility, built on school land but owned by Peterborough City Council and operated by Vivacity Peterborough, a charitable trust. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Jude, was built in 1968 on land donated by Thomas Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 10th Earl Fitzwilliam (via the Fitzwilliam Trust).
In 2001 teen-aged Netherton resident Ross Parker was murdered by a gang of up to ten Muslims of Pakistani background who had sought a white male to attack. A memorial plaque in Parker's memory is located at The Grange in Netherton.

96,"USS Scamp (SS-277), a Gato-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the scamp grouper, a member of the Serranidae family.
Her keel was laid down on March 6, 1942 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on July 20, 1942 sponsored by Miss Katherine Eugenia McKee, and commissioned on September 18, 1942 with Commander W.G. Ebert in command.


== First and second war patrols ==
On January 19, 1943, after training out of New London, Connecticut, Scamp set course for Pearl Harbor, via the Panama Canal. She arrived in Hawaii on February 13, 1943 and commenced final training in the local operating area. Scamp began her first war patrol on March 1, 1943. She stopped at Midway Island on March 5, debarked her passenger, Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr. Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, fueled, and then, headed for the coast of Honshū.
Her first two attacks on the enemy were doomed to failure by the faulty magnetic detonators in her torpedoes. After the inactivating of the magnetic features on her remaining torpedoes, Scamp scored two hits, one on an unidentified target on the night of March 20 and the other damaged Manju Maru early the next morning. The submarine stopped at Midway Island again on March 26 and returned to Pearl Harbor on April 7.
Scamp put to sea again on April 19, bound for the Southwest Pacific. She took on fuel at Johnston Island then slipped between the Marshall Islands and the Gilbert Islands to reconnoiter Ocean Island and Nauru Island. This mission she completed on April 27 and 28 and then shaped a course for the Bismarck Archipelago. She had to hold fire on each of her first three enemy contacts because they were hospital ships. However, on the afternoon of May 28, she succeeded in pumping three torpedoes into the converted seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru (The Kamikawa Maru had been damaged during an attack by the USS Wahoo on May 4, 1943). She evaded the enemy escorts and came up to periscope depth to observe the results. The enemy ship was down by the stern and loading men into boats. A little after midnight, Scamp finished off her stricken adversary with two more well aimed torpedoes. She ended her second war patrol at Brisbane, Australia, on June 4, 1943.


== Third and fourth war patrols ==

From Brisbane, she departed on her third war patrol on June 22, 1943. She patrolled a scouting line off the Solomon Islands and north to the Bismarck Sea. She passed the Shortland Islands on July 14 and, on July 27, 1943 encountered an enemy convoy. During her approach, a destroyer passed over her and dropped two depth charges some distance from her. Scamp continued her approach and loosed a spread of six torpedoes at a Japanese tanker. She scored a hit but had to dive in order to escape the escorts. When she surfaced, a little over an hour later, all enemy shipping was out of sight. Continuing her patrol into the Bismarck Islands, Scamp patrolled to the southeast of Steffen Strait, between New Ireland and New Hanover. At 17:54, still on July 27, 1943, she sighted a submarine, which launched a torpedo at Scamp. Scamp went ahead full and leveled off at 220 feet (67 m), letting the torpedo pass above her. Less than ten minutes later, she returned to periscope depth to engage her adversary. At 1812, she launched four torpedoes and the Japanese boat erupted in a tremendous explosion. At the time, it was believed that the loser of that duel was the Japanese submarine I-24. Later analysis of Japanese records indicated that it was not; rather, it was I-168, which had previously sunk the disabled aircraft carrier Yorktown and the destroyer USS Hammann at the Battle of Midway a year earlier on June 7, 1942. By August 8, 1943, Scamp was back in Brisbane.
After almost a month in port at Brisbane, the fleet submarine stood out on her fourth war patrol. She again patrolled off the Solomon Islands and into the Bismarck Sea. On September 18, 1943, she attacked a three-ship convoy and crippled one of them. Another changed course and avoided her torpedoes. Scamp passed close under the stricken enemy, trying to evade her escorts and came under machine gun fire from her victim. She escaped the pursuit of the enemy destroyers but lost the undamaged quarry in a rain squall. Scamp returned to finish off the 8614 ton passenger-cargo ship Kansai Maru, which she succeeded in doing late that night.
On the morning of September 21, 1943, Scamp happened upon a heavily guarded convoy and began to stalk it. After dark, she moved in for the kill and, after launching three torpedoes, heard two double explosions. Her second attack was foiled by a severe rain squall. However, Scamp hounded the convoy all through the day on September 22 and, at around 03:00 on September 23, unleashed four torpedoes at the convoy. While still maneuvering to attack the convoy, she passed through the wreckage of Kansai Maru and came upon an empty boat containing the sunken ship's logs and other documents. These were taken on board and later turned over to intelligence. Scamp made one more attempt upon the convoy, but was driven off by planes and kept down by aerial bombs. On September 24, she was ordered to terminate her patrol and she re-entered Brisbane on October 1, 1943.


== Fifth and sixth war patrols ==
She cleared port again on October 22 and began her fifth patrol with a mission in support of the Treasury Island invasion, October 28-30. From there, she moved to her patrol area, between Kavieng and Truk. On November 4, she launched three torpedoes at a passenger-cargo ship. One exploded prematurely, but one reached its mark. By the time of the explosion indicating success, Scamp was already in a dive evading a depth charge attacker. Six days later, she disabled the 6481 ton Tokyo Maru; then, after evading the escorts, fired three more torpedoes into the listing target. At about 21:00, the cripple was observed being towed away. It was later learned that Tokyo Maru sank before daybreak. On November 12, she damaged light cruiser Agano, so severely that the enemy warship remained in repair at Truk until the American strike of February 16 and 17, 1944. On November 18, Scamp suffered minor shrapnel damage from two bombs dropped by an enemy float plane. Eight days later, she sailed back into Brisbane.
On December 16, 1943, Scamp left Brisbane and headed back to the Bismarck Archipelago for her sixth war patrol. On the night of January 6, 1944, she missed a small tanker and was boxed in by the sound search of two Japanese destroyers. At 2323, she was able to surface and clear the area while the convoy escorts hunted for her about 8,000 yards (7.3 km) astern. On January 14, she slipped by two destroyers to launch six torpedoes at Nippon Maru. The 9,975 ton tanker sank as Scamp made her escape. Foiled in an attempt to return to the area, she headed south to act as plane guard north of Lyra Reef for B-24 bombers. On February 6, she put into Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit.


== Seventh war patrol ==
Scamp spent her seventh war patrol searching the shipping lanes between New Guinea, Palau, and Mindanao in the Philippines. She exited Milne Bay on March 3, 1944 and, after uneventful patrolling, put in at Langemak Bay, from March 29 to 31 for repairs to her torpedo data computer. Following her resumption of patrol, she battle surfaced on April 4 and set fire to a 200-ton trawler, but broke off the action when her deck gun failed.
Three days later, south of Davao Gulf, she encountered six cruisers escorted by destroyers and planes. She dived and the destroyers passed overhead without noticing her presence a scant 100 feet (30 m) below the surface. She returned to the surface at 1405 but was forced down by a plane. A little later, she tried to surface again but was attacked by a diving float plane. As she crash dived to escape the enemy plane, an aerial bomb exploded. All hands were knocked off their feet by the explosion and all power was lost. Scamp began to take an up angle and started to settle rapidly. At just below 300 feet (91 m), she began to hang on, then started up. The diving officer reported that the hydraulic controller had been jarred to ""off"" in the attack and that the hydraulic plant started closing all the main vents as fire started filling the maneuvering and after torpedo rooms with a thick, toxic smoke.
Fortunately, the sub caught at 52 feet (16 m), the decision having been made to surface and slug it out with the deck gun if she could not be held below 50 feet (15 m). Scamp started down again, ""see sawed"" three times, and started down a third time before power was regained. Soon the submarine was making two thirds speed on each shaft and had leveled off at 150 feet (46 m). She released oil and air bubbles to appear to have sunk and then headed for the Admiralty Islands. At 21:06, she surfaced and, with a 17 degree list, made for Seeadler Harbor, Manus, where she arrived on April 16, 1944.


== Eighth war patrol and loss ==
She made emergency repairs at Manus, shifted to Milne Bay on April 22 and then moved on to Pearl Harbor for a thorough overhaul at the yard. Scamp set out on her eighth war patrol on October 16. She fueled at Midway Island on October 20, then set course for the Bonin Islands. On November 9, she acknowledged a message changing her patrol area. She reported her position to be about 150 miles (240 km) north of the Bonin Islands with all 24 torpedoes aboard and 77,000 US gallons (290,000 L) of fuel remaining. On November 14 she was ordered to take up the life guard station off Tokyo Bay in support of B-29 Superfortress bomber strikes, but failed to acknowledge the message. Scamp was never heard from again. From records available after the war, it appears that Scamp was sighted by Japanese planes and reported depth charged by Kaibokan CD-4 to the south of Tokyo Bay on November 11, 1944. Scamp was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on April 28, 1945.
Scamp (SS-277) earned seven battle stars for World War II service.

97,"Banasree is a large affluent and upscale residential area of Dhaka in Bangladesh which has been developed by Eastern Housing Limited. The name ""Banasree"" means ""The beauty of forest"". It is one of the most desired places to live inside Dhaka as it is built with proper planning, adequate and sufficient housing, civil works, public facilities and infrastructure.
The area is originally built with the purpose of being solely residential in the eastern part of the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka and is divided into fourteen blocks (Blocks A-N). It is situated behind the Bangladesh Television Center in Rampura. A 170 feet wide pristine lake runs through the area which adds appeal, serenity and tranquility to the area. Banasree is overall very clean, green, peaceful and safe compared to its neighboring suburbs.
Banasree is a very convenient location to live in since it is accessible to major amenities such as numerous departmental stores, police stations, hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centers, pharmacies, stationery shops, cyber cafes, mosques, churches, temples, graveyards, shopping malls, telecommunication office, power sub-station, billing office, banks, boutiques, restaurants, bakeries, confectioneries, grocery stores, fast food outlets, fashion and design houses.
The newly developed Hatirjheel Lake Road Project connects the area with Gulshan and Dhanmondi making it one of the most expensive suburbs in Dhaka city to live in. The majority of the people who lives in Banasree are from the upper-middle-class background.
Banasree is effectively and efficiently run by a governing body named by ""Banasree Kolyan Shomiti"" which is elected by vote of the local resident owners. They provide services by being actively involved in development and maintenance work of the entire area by collecting funds annually from both landowners and apartment owners of Banasree. They also provide 24 hours security to the area by posting privately hired security guards throughout the area. Recently they have repaired most of the roads and drainage system in Banasree.


== Real estate and housing ==
The regular plot sizes in Banasree are 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 kathas. While the corner plots are measured at 1.75, 2.25, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 4.25 and 4.75 kathas. The internal sub road of the area is 25 and 30 feet wide while the larger roads or avenues are 40, 50 and 60, 80 & 100 feet wide. Most of the buildings in Banasree are residential apartments where the height of these buildings range between 7 and 14 stories high.
In May 2008, the government amended the ""Dhaka City Building Construction Rules"" which was passed in parliament after consulting with the Dhaka City Development Authority RAJUK along with urban planners, architects, engineers, developers and landowners by fixing the Floor area ratio or FAR in all areas in Dhaka City including Banasree between 1:3.5 and 1:6.5 which is applicable for both new construction of residential and commercial buildings depending on the plot size and the adjacent road width of the plot. Also landowners and real estate developers must keep a minimum of 50% open space of the total land area (for over 3 kathas of land) of which 25% shall be paved and the rest 25% area must be green or landscaped with gardens when constructing a high rise building in accordance with FAR. Whereas, for small plots a minimum of 30% (for under 2 kathas) & 40% (for under 3 kathas) of the total land area must be kept open. Also in the new building construction rules, the civil aviation authority has imposed a height restriction in all residential areas in Dhaka city to 22 stories and 28 stories for all commercial areas except Motijheel. In Motijheel, a building can be raised up to a maximum of 38 stories. However, all buildings within a 3.5 km radius of both Shahjalal International Airport and Tejgaon Airport cannot exceed the 14 stories height limit.
Banasree is currently experiencing a real estate boom where demand for apartments is very high due to its centralized location in Dhaka city. Furthermore, developers are seizing the opportunity by meeting the huge wave of demand by constructing new apartments and commercial buildings by going into a 50:50 ratio joint-venture land development with landowners of vacant plots. This has led to a skyrocketing of real estate prices in the area.
The average apartment prices per square feet in Banasree is about $70- $100 (USD) and land price is around $100,000 (USD) per katha (1 katha = 720 square feet). Meanwhile, monthly apartment rents ranges between $200-$500 (USD). Most of the apartment in Banasree are sized in between 750 square feet (70 square meters) to 1850 square feet (170 square meters). Larger apartments sized more than 1850 square feet are found on the wider roads.


== Transportation ==
Four buses connects Banasree with major areas of Dhaka city.
Torongo Plus starts at K block of Banasree and ends at Mohammadpur with having stoppages at Khilgaon, Malibagh, Moghbazar, Shantinagar, Ramna Park, Shahbagh, Elephant Road, Dhanmondi and Lalmatia. Another bus service company Alif Enterprise, which is also known as Bengal, starts from Block J and stops at Rampura, Badda, Gulshan-1, Mohakhali and Mirpur. Dibanishi offers a limited daily Banasree-Banani route via Badda, Baridhara Diplomatic Zone and Gulshan-2. Falguni also offers a daily Banasree-Uttara route via Bashundhara and Shahjalal International Airport.
A flyover or U-Loop is nearing completion which is being built at the entrance of Banasree so that the area will be directly linked with Hatirjheel Lake Road. This U-Loop will ease traffic congestion during peak hours at DIT road and Progoti Sarani.
The government has plans to build a metro rail (a long term project initiated by the government and funded by Japan) through this area in the near future with Banasree having a station under MRT Line 5.

Hara graduated from Keio University in 1990, and then studied at the Tokyo College of Photography until 1996.
Using a medium-format camera, Hara takes photographs of people she encounters outside, in the train, and so forth. She said ""My shooting style is so-called snapshot, so I can say all of my photographs were taken by a mere accident, . . . They are the photographs of somewhere yet nowhere.""
Comparing her photography with that of Rinko Kawauchi, Ferdinand Brueggeman writes

Mikiko Hara's photography is poetic as well, but she has a different topic. She talks about distance and isolation of people in public spaces – especially of women.

102,"POSCO India Private Limited (commonly POSCO India or Posco-India) is an Indian subsidiary of Korean conglomerate POSCO.
Its parent company POSCO signed a memorandum of understanding in June 2005 with the state government of Odisha to construct a $12 billion steel plant. Various regulatory delays and controversies prevented the company from starting construction. The memorandum expired in June 2011, and as of April 2012, it has not been renewed. Apart from Odisha, POSCO India has project sites in the Karnataka and Maharashtra states.


== History ==
POSCO signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in June 2005, to incorporate an Indian subsidiary and build a steel plant in Odisha. Posco India was incorporated by POSCO in August 2005 with the Registrar of Companies, Odisha, under India's Companies Act 1956.


=== Odisha ===
According to the MoU of 2005, POSCO agreed to invest in the Jagatsinghpur district of Odisha to establish an integrated plant to manufacture steel, mine iron ore and other ores, as well as the infrastructure necessary for its operation in Odisha. The MoU listed the following understanding between POSCO and the state of Odisha:
Establish a FINEX/BF plant in phases. The first phase would be completed in two modules, together attracting a total of Rs. 218 billion ($5.1 billion) investment. The first phase would produce 6 million tons per year of crude steel, and 5.64 million tons per year of finished steel. The MoU mentioned a second phase, also to be completed in steps of two modules, together attracting a total of Rs. 215 billion ($5 billion) investment. The second phase would double the plant's capacity to 12 million tons per year of crude steel, and 11.28 million tons per year of finished steel.
The state of Odisha promised to be a partner in development. The state agreed to acquire and provide three land parcels to POSCO: about 25 acres (10 ha) of land in Bhubaneswar for POSCO India to establish its Indian headquarters; about 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) in the state of Odisha to set up a steel plant, build port infrastructure, establish a storage yard for coking coal, and other associated facilities; and, about 2000 acres of land for POSCO to develop a township, recreational activities and all related social infrastructure – of which approximately 1,500 acres (610 ha) would be identified adjacent/near to the Steel project and remaining 500 acres (200 ha) near the mining location.
The state of Odisha agreed to work with the central government of India to arrange necessary supplies and infrastructure for steel production by POSCO India. These supplies included water, electrical power, drainage and sewerage, licenses and permits to obtain coal and iron ore, rail links, and a highway road connection.
POSCO India agreed to conduct a rapid Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and prepare a detailed EIA Report and an Environment Management Plan (EMP) for the Project. The Government of Odisha agreed to provide any assistance requested by the Company during the time the EIA is conducted and the EMP is prepared. The state of Odisha also agreed in the MoU to use its best efforts to procure the grant of all environmental approvals and forest clearances from the central government of India within the minimum possible time for the project.
As of June 2012, controversies and regulatory delays have prevented Posco India's Odisha project to proceed beyond the concept. Posco India has no mining or manufacturing operations in Odisha


=== Karnataka ===
In addition to its attempt to establish a steel plant Odisha, Posco-India considered alternate sites for a steel plant. In June 2010, Posco signed a memorandum of understanding with the state of Karnataka at the Global Investors Meet in Bangalore. This memorandum envisions a 6 MMT per year steel plant based on Posco's high efficiency, low environment impact FINEX technology. In May 2011, under mandated stock exchange disclosurer rules, Posco confirmed the memorandum of understanding for the steel works in the state of Karnataka; with a cautionary note that POSCO has not made any decisive plans to implement the Project due to the fact that the Government of Karnataka has yet to confirm certain investment plans for the Project.
The government of Karnataka took a different approach to land acquisition for Posco project than the government of Odisha. The state of Karnataka announced that it will not acquire land on a lot-by-lot basis, rather the land acquisition will be on complete consensus, on all-or-none, and will involve simultaneous negotiations at multiple locations in different parts of the state of Karnataka. In July 2011, the state of Karnataka announced that it is currently working on land acquisition for Posco-India project in the following districts: Gadag, Bagalkot, Bijapur, Raichur and Yadgir.


== Controversies ==
Posco India expected to start steel plant construction promptly after signing the 2005 MoU. However, the company was unable to start construction because of social and environmental controversies.
A year after the 2005 MoU was signed, India's parliament passed a new law, which directly affected Posco-India. This law, The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, is also commonly called as the Forests Rights Act. The law granted certain rights to forest-dwelling communities in India, including the use of forest land and other resources. This law has been controversial and is opposed by environmentalists and wildlife conservationists, who petition that the law makes it impossible to protect forests from human presence and use, and for the purposes of ecological and wildlife conservation. The Forests Rights Act was published in 2007, and became effective in 2008. This law was retroactively applied to the Posco-India project.
India's Supreme Court examined the facts related to the state government of Odisha's initiatives to enter into MoU to encourage economic growth in the state, and whether such development meets the intent of ecological and environmental laws of India. On 8 August 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the state of Odisha, in Case Law I.A. number 2134 of 2007, titled T.N. Godavaraman Thirumulpad vs. Union of India, State of Odisha and others. In their ruling, the Supreme Court justices wrote, ""the State of Odisha [is] to be associated with Special Purpose Vehicle in order to ensure implementation of proper schemes for the development of the tribal area and in our Order it has not been suggested for incorporation of the Special Purpose Vehicle to take over the mines which have been leased out by State of Odisha to the lessee. The reason is obvious. We cannot change leases/MoUs/joint venture agreements signed between the parties at earlier point of time which have been approved by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, and other Authorities. The object for passing the Order was to strike a balance between development and environmental protection. The Lanjigarh tehsil in Kalahandi district, as stated in our Order dated 23.11.07, faces abject poverty. At the same time the area is eco-sensitive area. We have tried to strike a balance in order to subserve the principle of Sustainable Development.""
The August 2008 ruling by Supreme Court of India also instructed the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) of India to examine, and then if appropriate, grant approval under the law. The Ministry of Environment and Forests of India accepted the ruling and examined the facts and reviewed the facts under Indian laws, including the Forests Rights Act. The review process included a committee that visited Odisha many times, including the Posco-India's planned site, the villages, the Forests covering the proposed plant site and iron ore mining area, environmentalists, ecologists, social activists, farmers, and families that may be affected by the proposed Posco-India initiative. The review process by Ministry of Environment and Forests of India took over 2.5 years.


=== N. C. Saxena committee ===
In July 2010, a nineteen-member NC Saxena committee visited Odisha and made a very public denouncement about the non-recognition of forest rights by the Government of Odisha and violation of the Forest Rights Act, in the forest areas proposed to be diverted for the POSCO India project. The committee urged the Ministry of Environment and Forests of Government of India to withdraw the clearance given to the State Government for diversion of the forest land. In August 2010, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India, in response to the claims of NC Saxena committee, issued a stop work order. The order directed that all land acquisition and transfer for Posco India project, including handing over of the forest and non-forest land be stopped forthwith, and details submitted to the Ministry. The state government of Odisha and Posco India respected the stop work order from the central government of India.


=== Meena Gupta committee ===
Later, a four-member Meena Gupta committee was appointed by the Government of India. This committee claimed to have conducted intensive enquiry by consulting a large number of documents, field visits and meeting a large number of people (including officials of Odisha government, local affected inhabitants, NGOs and civil society and experts in concerned fields). The committee after examining various social, ecological and environmental issues, returned a split report to the government of India in October 2010:
Meena Gupta, the committee chairperson, acknowledged that the Scheduled Tribes enjoy an important Constitutional status in India, and disturbing or displacing them stands on a different footing from displacement of other people. She claimed Posco India plant, is planned to be located in a coastal district which is not a Scheduled Area and has virtually no Scheduled Tribe people. The people to be displaced are mostly agricultural and fishermen families (about 700 families). In the report, she claimed that while Posco India is to be located on land classified as forest land, this area recorded as forest is mainly sandy waste, with some scrub forest, apart from the casuarina plantations in the area.
The other three members of the committee claimed that past satellite imagery data suggested current areas under casuarina plantation in the coastal areas were, in past, covered with mangroves. These forests were destroyed either during super cyclones or by illegal cutting. The members also claimed that 21 names from voter list of 2006, from the land proposed for Posco India, belonged to Scheduled Tribe protected by the Forests Rights Act of 2008.
After the government of Odisha and Posco India announced the MoU and its planned location in 2005, the opposition to the POSCO project was widespread in all the eight villages where it was supposed to be sited. Subsequently, a number of the villagers changed their opinion, according to the Meena Gupta report. The report claimed that the reason for change in opinion were: the realisation that not all eight villages but only two hamlets would be fully displaced, and a small part of Gadakujang; they also realised that most of the land that would be given was government land, not private land; the fairly liberal compensation package, and the possibility of jobs for their children in the future. As of October 2010, the report claimed, in almost every village, except one, the villagers are almost equally divided between supporters of the POSCO project and opponents of the project. One village, Dhinkia, however, has remained steadfastly opposed to the project; so much so that the villagers drove out of the village the few families that were favourably inclined towards the project. The villagers of Dhinkia also started, the report claimed, a blockade of the village to prevent government or POSCO officials from entering the village.
The Meena Gupta committee report claimed political controversy is part of the scene: the Communist Party of India (CPI) strongly opposes the project, the Communist Party of India – Marxist (CPM) is not opposed to the project if it is shifted a little and if Paradeep port is used instead of a separate captive port. Several other parties, across the spectrum, were not opposed to Posco India, in fact they said they welcomed it, but the present location of Posco, the lack of consultation with other political parties, the issues of water to the plant were cited as some of the reasons for their objection. The Meena Gupta committee also report claimed the POSCO project is an integrated project encompassing different components like the township, pipeline, road and transportation etc. These, the committee claimed, have been left out of the scope of its initial environment impact analysis. Such partial environment impact analysis was insufficient, the full environmental impact of the entire project is necessary. One of the committee members, Dr. Suresh. sought a clarification from Posco India and the government of Odisha. Both of these parties along regional office of Ministry of Environment – Government of India cooperated and delivered a copy of comprehensive environmental impact analysis for steel plant, captive port and related infrastructure, to the Meena Gupta committee, as completed by July 2007. Some members of the committee note that this comprehensive environment impact analysis should have been completed in 2005, not in 2007. Three committee members claim that clearances granted in past should have been limited to the scope of the initial environment impact analysis of 2005 for 4 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) plant. The clearances for the entire 12 MMT plant and port, the committee suggests, should be based on the 2007 comprehensive environment impact analysis.
In October 2010, Posco India issued a press release in response to media coverage of Meena Gupta Committee report. The company categorically stated that it never violated any law or procedure for obtaining any governmental clearance whatsoever required for the project. Posco India further stated it has experienced an unexpected delay in initiating project work because certain circumstances, laws and legal procedures within India have been changing between 2005 and 2010. The company claimed that since the time of signing of the memorandum of understanding in 2005, it has set and followed high standards of environment protection and corporate governance, while involving all stakeholders.


=== 2011–2012 developments ===
On 31 January 2011, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of India gave final clearance to the Posco-India project, subject to the state of Odisha and Posco-India meeting additional conditions. The clearance document included the findings of its review. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, claiming the need to protect the environment, forests and those affected by Posco-India, included 60 new conditions on the project — 28 for the steel plant and 32 for the captive port.
The June 2005 MoU expired in June 2011. The state government of Odisha stated that it intends to replace the expired MoU, and sign a new and revised MoU with POSCO. As of September 2011, the MOU renewal remains a subject of negotiation between POSCO India and the state government of Odisha, because the state has proposed changes and new conditions to the original MOU signed in June 2005.
On 14 June 2011 Odisha government paused land acquisition at the proposed steel plant of Posco in Dhinkia gram panchayat (village). On 8 September 2011 Odisha High Court ruled that land acquisition is in public interest, allowed non-private land acquisition by state government for POSCO India to proceed, and ordered a continued pause on the acquisition of private land till further ruling.
On 25 November 2011 Abhay Sahu, the leader of the anti-Posco movement in Odisha, was arrested over his alleged involvement in several criminal cases. Sahu was the head of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti (PPSS), a Communist Party of India backed organisation, that had been convincing villagers in Odisha and organising opposition to the Posco investment in Odisha. Police officials claimed Sahu was arrested over the death of a woman allegedly due to dowry demands. The police also claimed that there were additional criminal charges against Sahu. He was a member of Communist Party of India's state politburo, and in his direction PPSS was claimed to be the main hurdle to Posco India project in Odisha.
In 2012, POSCO India and Paradip Port Trust studied possibilities for using the existing Paradip Port facilities for steel export from the planned steel mill.


== Claimed benefits from POSCO India project ==
India’s National Council of Applied Economic Research completed and published in January 2007, its report on the social cost benefit analysis of Posco India project. This research team considered two alternatives: producing steel within the state of Odisha versus mining the iron ore, exporting it and importing the steel. The report claimed mining iron ore and producing steel locally in the state of Odisha is significantly better option for India, over the option of India exporting lower cost iron ore overseas, encouraging other countries to produce the steel, and then India importing the higher cost produced steel. The report also claims:
an economic internal rate of return to India from the POSCO project to be 16.6%
sensitivity analysis indicates that even in the worst-case scenario – sales 10 per cent lower than estimated – the economic return to India to be 13.9%.
the economic impact of the Posco India steel plant alone, to India’s population, to be Rs. 112 billion ($2.5 billion) assuming a discount rate of 12%.
the project additionally will contribute direct and indirect taxes as the iron ore is mined, steel is produced, the metal is converted into products by Indian economy, and these steel products are consumed in various sectors of Indian economy. The report claims the Posco India project will produce an average of Rs. 249 billion per year ($5.44 billion per year) of steel for India’s economy, contribute an average of Rs. 49.9 billion per year ($1.1 billion per year) of domestic sales taxes, capital goods taxes, value added taxes (VAT), iron ore duties, and employee income taxes, annually for 35 years, for the social programs of the central government of India and state government of Odisha. The report admits that its analysis is based on nominal numbers using 2007 basis, that it assumes constant steel prices at $450 per tonne through the year 2040, and ignores the effect of inflation in steel prices or in Indian economy. The carbon steel prices between January and July 2011 ranged between $815 to $910 per tonne.
the POSCO India project’s FINEX process, the report claims will be superior in preventing air pollution in India. It will be 10 times less polluting in sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions than currently used BF process in India. The POSCO process, the report claims, will also be 25 times less polluting in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 5 times less polluting in particulate dust terms than the process currently used by steel plants of India.
These claimed benefits are disputed as incomplete. For example, activists claim that land acquisition for Posco India will adversely affect betel farmers who in recent decades encroached upon government land to farm betel leaves and claim to earn INR 10 to 1750,000 (US$30,000) per hectare per year from growing betel leaves for paan.

104,"United States Presidents and their families have often had pets while serving in office.


== History of White House dogs ==
The first White House dog to receive regular newspaper coverage was Warren G. Harding's dog Laddie Boy.
Pets also featured on presidential elections. Herbert Hoover got a Belgian shepherd dog, King Tut, during his campaign and pictures of him with his new dog were sent all across the United States.
In 1944 Franklin D. Roosevelt was running for his fourth term when rumors surfaced that his Scottish Terrier, Fala, had accidentally been left behind when visiting the Aleutian Islands. After allegedly sending back ships to rescue his dog, Roosevelt was ridiculed and accused of spending thousands of taxpayers' dollars to retrieve his dog. At a speech following this Roosevelt said, ""you can criticize me, my wife and my family, but you can't criticize my little dog. He's Scotch and all these allegations about spending all this money have just made his little soul furious."" What was later called the ""Fala Speech"" reportedly helped secure re-election for Roosevelt.

Richard Nixon was accused of hiding a secret slush fund during his candidacy for vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. He gave the televised ""Checkers speech"" named after his cocker spaniel, denying he had a slush fund but admitting, ""there is one thing that I did get as a gift that I'm not going to give back."" The gift was a black-and-white cocker spaniel, Checkers, given to his daughters. Although there had been talk of Nixon being dropped from the ticket, following his speech he received an increase in support and Mamie Eisenhower reportedly recommended he stay because he was ""such a warm person.""
Animal lovers were upset when President Lyndon B. Johnson was photographed picking his two Beagle dogs named Him and Her up by their ears. Others did not understand the uproar; former President Harry S. Truman said, ""What the hell are the critics complaining about; that's how you handle hounds.""

105,"The Bradford Burns Unit is world-renowned burns research facility set up at University of Bradford following the Bradford fire disaster on 11 May 1985. The fire disaster at Valley Parade killed 56 people and injured more than 250.


== Founder ==
Professor David Sharpe founded the Bradford Burns Unit after he received many of the burns victims from the Bradford Fire Disaster in 1985.


== Born from the Bradford Fire Disaster ==
On 11 May 1985, just before half time of the old Division 3 fixture between Bradford City Football Club and Lincoln City Football Club, on the last game of the 1984/85 season, a fire broke out in the G block of the main stand at Valley Parade.
The fire quickly spread and within minutes the whole of the wooden main stand was engulfed, resulting in the death of 56 people and injury of over 250.
After a full inquest, it was revealed that the cause of the fire was a disregarded cigarette which had been dropped where there was a build up of litter. This caught fire and with the assistance of wind and a wooden stand. Caused the fire to quickly spread.
The horrific injuries that a young David Sharpe had to treat along with other staff lead to him setting up the Bradford Burns Unit at Bradford University to research ways into treating burns injuries.


== Fundraising ==


=== Bantams Trek ===
As a result of the need for ongoing funding for the Burns Unit, In late 2010 Bantams Trek was set up to raise money for it by Bradford City assistant kit manager Graham Duckworth.
It was given its name as the majority of events would involve walking. It was set up by Bradford City assistant kit manager Graham Duckworth whose first walk was from Bradford City's home ground Valley Parade to Lincoln City's home ground at Sincil Bank, a 73 miles walk completed in under 24 hours which was completed on 1 January 2011. It raised £6660 for the Bradford Burns Unit and a presentation was made at half time of the corresponding fixture between Bradford City and Lincoln City at Valley Parade on 2 February 2011.
On 18 June 2011 Peter Jackson & Lee Bullock took part in the Bantams Trek 3 Peaks Challenge to raise money for the Bradford Burns Unit along with 45 other Bradford City supporters.


=== Burns Unit Appeal ===
Bradford Newspaper Telegraph & Argus set up an appeal to save the Bradford Burns Unit in 2009 after it was reported that the Bradford Burns Unit needed £100,000 to keep doing their research work.

The club posted a 6–1–4 league record under head coach George Halas earning them a second-place finish in the team standings, the fourth time in the last five years. The Bears started slow with 2 ties and a loss, but quickly gained their stride, winning 6 of their last 8 games with two ties. The Bears only loss of the year was to the Cleveland Bulldogs, the eventual champions (the NFL officially considers the 1924 Bulldogs a different team than the Canton team from the previous year – however, all the players were the same). Despite coming in second, the Bears did defeat the cross-town rival Cardinals twice, both shutouts, and their future classic rival, the Green Bay Packers, once in a 3–0 shutout. The Sternaman brothers again carried the team, with Joe Sternaman having his best season. The younger Sternaman scored 6 touchdowns, threw for another, had 9 field goals, and 12 PATs, finishing with 75 of the Bears' 136 points.

112,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also known as lipoglycans and endotoxins, are large molecules consisting of a lipid and a polysaccharide composed of O-antigen, outer core and inner core joined by a covalent bond; they are found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and elicit strong immune responses in animals.
The term lipooligosaccharide (""LOS"") is used to refer to a low-molecular-weight form of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.


== Discovery ==
The toxic activity of LPS was first discovered and termed ""endotoxin"" by Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer, who distinguished between exotoxins, which he classified as a toxin that is released by bacteria into the surrounding environment, and endotoxins, which he considered to be a toxin kept ""within"" the bacterial cell and released only after destruction of the bacterial cell wall. Subsequent work showed that release of LPS from gram negative microbes does not necessarily require the destruction of the bacterial cell wall, but rather, LPS is secreted as part of the normal physiological activity of membrane vesicle trafficking in the form of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which may also contain other virulence factors and proteins.
Today, the term 'endotoxin' is mostly used synonymously with LPS, although there are a few endotoxins that are not related to LPS, such as the so-called delta endotoxin proteins secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis.


== Functions in bacteria ==
LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS also increases the negative charge of the cell membrane and helps stabilize the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to Gram-negative bacteria, which die if it is mutated or removed. LPS induces a strong response from normal animal immune systems. It has also been implicated in non-pathogenic aspects of bacterial ecology, including surface adhesion, bacteriophage sensitivity, and interactions with predators such as amoebae.
LPS is required for the proper conformation of Omptin activity; however, smooth LPS will sterically hinder omptins.


== Composition ==

It comprises three parts:
O antigen (or O polysaccharide)
Core oligosaccharide
Lipid A


=== O-antigen ===
A repetitive glycan polymer contained within an LPS is referred to as the O antigen, O polysaccharide, or O side-chain of the bacteria. The O antigen is attached to the core oligosaccharide, and comprises the outermost domain of the LPS molecule. The composition of the O chain varies from strain to strain. For example, there are over 160 different O antigen structures produced by different E. coli strains. The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. Full-length O-chains would render the LPS smooth, whereas the absence or reduction of O-chains would make the LPS rough. Bacteria with rough LPS usually have more penetrable cell membranes to hydrophobic antibiotics, since a rough LPS is more hydrophobic. O antigen is exposed on the very outer surface of the bacterial cell, and, as a consequence, is a target for recognition by host antibodies.


=== Core ===

The Core domain always contains an oligosaccharide component that attaches directly to lipid A and commonly contains sugars such as heptose and 3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (also known as KDO, keto-deoxyoctulosonate). The LPS Cores of many bacteria also contain non-carbohydrate components, such as phosphate, amino acids, and ethanolamine substituents.


=== Lipid A ===

Lipid A is, in normal circumstances, a phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide decorated with multiple fatty acids. These hydrophobic fatty acid chains anchor the LPS into the bacterial membrane, and the rest of the LPS projects from the cell surface. The lipid A domain is responsible for much of the toxicity of Gram-negative bacteria. When bacterial cells are lysed by the immune system, fragments of membrane containing lipid A are released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock (also called septic shock). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the LPS.


== Lipooligosaccharides ==
Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are glycolipids found in the outer membrane of some types of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria spp. and Haemophilus spp. The term is synonymous with the low molecular weight form of bacterial LPS. LOS plays a central role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the outer membrane of the Gram negative cell envelope. Lipooligosaccharides play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain bacterial infections because they are capable of acting as immunostimulators and immunomodulators. Furthermore, LOS molecules are responsible for the ability of some bacterial strains to display molecular mimicry and antigenic diversity, aiding in the evasion of host immune defenses and thus contributing to the virulence of these bacterial strains.
Chemically, lipooligosaccharides lack O-antigens and possess only a lipid A-based outer membrane-anchoring moiety, and an oligosaccharide core. In the case of Neisseria meningitidis, the lipid A portion of the molecule has a symmetrical structure and the inner core is composed of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO) and heptose (Hep) moieties. The outer core oligosaccharide chain varies depending on the bacterial strain. The term lipooligosaccharide is used to refer to the low molecular weight form of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, which can be categorized into two forms: the high molecular weight (Mr, or smooth) form possesses a high molecular weight, repeating polysaccharide O-chain, while the low molecular weight (low-Mr or rough) form, lacks the O-chain but possesses a short oligosaccharide in its place.


== LPS modifications ==
The making of LPS can be modified in order to present a specific sugar structure. Those can be recognised by either other LPS (which enables to inhibit LPS toxins) or glycosyltransferases that use those sugar structure to add more specific sugars. It has recently been shown that a specific enzyme in the intestine (alkaline phosphatase) can detoxify LPS by removing the two phosphate groups found on LPS carbohydrates. This may function as an adaptive mechanism to help the host manage potentially toxic effects of gram-negative bacteria normally found in the small intestine. A different enzyme may detoxify LPS when it enters, or is produced in, animal tissues. Neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells produce a lipase, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), that inactivates LPS by removing the two secondary acyl chains from lipid A. If they are given LPS parenterally, mice that lack AOAH develop high titers of non-specific antibodies, develop prolonged hepatomegaly, and experience prolonged endotoxin tolerance. LPS inactivation may be required for animals to restore homeostasis after parenteral LPS exposure.


== Biosynthesis and transport ==


== Biological effects on hosts infected with gram-negative bacteria ==


=== Immune response ===
LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex in many cell types, but especially in monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, which promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and eicosanoids.
As part of the cellular stress response, superoxide is one of the major reactive oxygen species induced by LPS in various cell types that express TLR (toll-like receptor).
LPS is also an exogenous pyrogen (fever-inducing substance).
Being of crucial importance to Gram-negative bacteria, these molecules make candidate targets for new antimicrobial agents.
Some researchers doubt reports of generalized toxic effects attributed to all lipopolysaccharides, in particular, for cyanobacteria.
LPS function has been under experimental research for several years due to its role in activating many transcription factors. LPS also produces many types of mediators involved in septic shock. Humans are much more sensitive to LPS than other animals (e.g., mice). A dose of 1 µg/kg induces shock in humans, but mice will tolerate a dose up to a thousand times higher. This may relate to differences in the level of circulating natural antibodies between the two species. Said et al. showed that LPS causes an IL-10-dependent inhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion and function by up-regulating PD-1 levels on monocytes which leads to IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L1.
Endotoxins are in large part responsible for the dramatic clinical manifestations of infections with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, the pathogens that causes meningococcal disease, including meningococcemia, Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, and meningitis.
Bruce Beutler was awarded a portion of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work demonstrating that TLR4 is the LPS receptor.
Portions of the LPS from several bacterial strains have been shown to be chemically similar to human host cell surface molecules; the ability of some bacteria to present molecules on their surface which are chemically identical or similar to the surface molecules of some types of host cells is termed molecular mimicry. For example, in Neisseria meningitidis L2,3,5,7,9, the terminal tetrasaccharide portion of the oligosaccharide (lacto-N-neotetraose) is the same tetrasaccharide as that found in paragloboside, a precursor for ABH glycolipid antigens found on human erythrocytes. In another example, the terminal trisaccharide portion (lactotriaose) of the oligosaccharide from pathogenic Neisseria spp. LOS is also found in lactoneoseries glycosphingolipids from human cells. Most meningococci from groups B and C, as well as gonococci, have been shown to have this trisaccharide as part of their LOS structure. The presence of these human cell surface 'mimics' may, in addition to acting as a 'camouflage' from the immune system, play a role in the abolishment of immune tolerance when infecting hosts with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, such as HLA-B35.


=== Effect of variability on immune response ===

O-antigens (the outer carbohydrates) are the most variable portion of the LPS molecule, imparting the antigenic specificity. In contrast, lipid A is the most conserved part. However, lipid A composition also may vary (e.g., in number and nature of acyl chains even within or between genera). Some of these variations may impart antagonistic properties to these LPS. For example, Rhodobacter sphaeroides diphosphoryl lipid A (RsDPLA) is a potent antagonist of LPS in human cells, but is an agonist in hamster and equine cells.
It has been speculated that conical Lipid A (e.g., from E. coli) are more agonistic, less conical lipid A like those of Porphyromonas gingivalis may activate a different signal (TLR2 instead of TLR4), and completely cylindrical lipid A like that of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is antagonistic to TLRs.
LPS gene clusters are highly variable between different strains, subspecies, species of bacterial pathogens of plants and animals.
Normal human blood serum contains anti-LOS antibodies that are bactericidal and patients that have infections caused by serotypically distinct strains possess anti-LOS antibodies that differ in their specificity compared with normal serum. These differences in humoral immune response to different LOS types can be attributed to the structure of the LOS molecule, primarily within the structure of the oligosaccharide portion of the LOS molecule. In Neisseria gonorrhoeae it has been demonstrated that the antigenicity of LOS molecules can change during an infection due to the ability of these bacteria to synthesize more than one type of LOS, a characteristic known as phase variation. Additionally, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, are capable of further modifying their LOS in vitro, for example through sialylation (modification with sialic acid residues), and as a result are able to increase their resistance to complement-mediated killing  or even down-regulate complement activation or evade the effects of bactericidal antibodies. Sialylation may also contribute to hindered neutrophil attachment and phagocytosis by immune system cells as well as a reduced oxidative burst. Haemophilus somnus, a pathogen of cattle, has also been shown to display LOS phase variation, a characteristic which may help in the evasion of bovine host immune defenses. Taken together, these observations suggest that variations in bacterial surface molecules such as LOS can help the pathogen evade both the humoral (antibody and complement-mediated) and the cell-mediated (killing by neutrophils, for example) host immune defenses.


== Health effects ==


=== Endotoxemia ===
The presence of endotoxins in the blood is called endotoxemia. It can lead to septic shock, if the immune response is severely pronounced.
Moreover, endotoxemia of intestinal origin, especially, at the host-pathogen interface, is considered to be an important factor in the development of alcoholic hepatitis, which is likely to develop on the basis of the small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome and an increased intestinal permeability.
Lipid A may cause uncontrolled activation of mammalian immune systems with production of inflammatory mediators that may lead to septic shock. This inflammatory reaction is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 which is responsible for immune system cell activation. Damage to the endothelial layer of blood vessels caused by these inflammatory mediators can lead to capillary leak syndrome, dilation of blood vessels and a decrease in cardiac function and can lead to septic shock. Pronounced complement activation can also be observed later in the course as the bacteria multiply in the blood. High bacterial proliferation triggering destructive endothelial damage can also lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with loss of function of certain internal organs such as the kidneys, adrenal glands and lungs due to compromised blood supply. The skin can show the effects of vascular damage often coupled with depletion of coagulation factors in the form of petechiae, purpura and ecchymoses. The limbs can also be affected, sometimes with devastating consequences such as the development of gangrene, requiring subsequent amputation. Loss of function of the adrenal glands can cause adrenal insufficiency and additional hemorrhage into the adrenals causes Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, both of which can be life-threatening. It has also been reported that gonococcal LOS can cause damage to human fallopian tubes.


=== Auto-immune disease ===
The molecular mimicry of some LOS molecules is thought to cause autoimmune-based host responses, such as flareups of multiple sclerosis. Other examples of bacterial mimicry of host structures via LOS are found with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, organisms which cause gastrointestinal disease in humans, and Haemophilus ducreyi which causes chancroid. Certain C. jejuni LPS serotypes (attributed to certain tetra- and pentasaccharide moieties of the core oligosaccharide) have also been implicated with Guillain–Barré syndrome and a variant of Guillain–Barré called Miller-Fisher syndrome.


=== Link to obesity ===
Epidemiological studies have previously shown that increased endotoxin load, which can be a result of increased populations of endotoxin producing bacteria in the intestinal tract, is associated with certain obesity-related patient groups. Other studies have shown that purified endotoxin from Escherichia coli can induce obesity and insulin-resistance when injected into germ-free mouse models. A more recent study has uncovered a potentially contributing role for Enterobacter cloacae B29 toward obesity and insulin resistance in a human patient. The presumed mechanism for the association of endotoxin with obesity is that endotoxin induces an inflammation-mediated pathway accounting for the observed obesity and insulin resistance.There is a correlation between plasma LPS and insulin resistance.

== Laboratory research and biotechnology production systems ==
Lipopolysaccharides are frequent contaminants in plasmid DNA prepared from bacteria or proteins expressed from bacteria, and must be removed from the DNA or protein to avoid contaminating experiments and to avoid toxicity of products manufactured using industrial fermentation.
Also, ovalbumin is frequently contaminated with endotoxins. Ovalbumin is one of the extensively studied proteins in animal models and also an established model allergen for airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Commercially available ovalbumin that is contaminated with LPS can fully activate endothelial cells in an in-vitro assay of the first step of inflammation, and it falsifies research results, as it does not accurately reflect the effect of sole protein antigen on animal physiology.
In pharmaceutical production, it is necessary to remove all traces of endotoxin from drug product containers, as even small amounts of endotoxin will cause illness in humans. A depyrogenation oven is used for this purpose. Temperatures in excess of 300 °C are required to break down this substance. A defined endotoxin reduction rate is a correlation between time and temperature. Based on primary packaging material as syringes or vials, a glass temperature of 250 °C and a holding time of 30 minutes is typical to achieve a reduction of endotoxin levels by a factor of 1000.
The standard assay for detecting presence of endotoxin is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay, utilizing blood from the Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Very low levels of LPS can cause coagulation of the limulus lysate due to a powerful amplification through an enzymatic cascade. However, due to the dwindling population of horseshoe crabs, and the fact that there are factors that interfere with the LAL assay, efforts have been made to develop alternative assays, with the most promising ones being ELISA tests using a recombinant version of a protein in the LAL assay, Factor C.

General sale continued for several years. These later models have a shutter release lock lever on the shutter release collar. It is a professional oriented 35mm SLR camera that had a comprehensive range of accessories available. It has a removable pentaprism viewfinder and focusing screen. It features the Exakta bayonet lens mount for interchangeable lenses. A special accessory shoe is situated at the base of the rewind knob with a standard PC sync. contact next to it. The release button is placed at the right-hand camera front, but it lacks a mirror-up facility. This was included on the upgraded versions. The standard lens is the RE. Auto-Topcor 1:1.4 f=5.8cm or the slightly slower 1:1.8 version. A battery-operated winder to be attached to the camera base was made available.
Some common features of 35mm SLR photography were first seen on the Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lenses have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting a fraction of the light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.

Tokyo Kogaku KK
Tokyo Kogaku KK launched their first 35mm SLR camera in 1957, about two years before the Nikon F and the Canonflex. This was the Topcon R that acquired the bayonet lens mount from the Exakta Varex camera from Ihagee in Dresden, successor to the Kine Exakta of 1936. It was also inspired by the Zeiss Ikon Contax S as well as the Japanese Miranda T - most obviously the body shape by the former, and the detachable finder prism by the latter. However, it was not until 1963 the Topcon name became famous by introducing the Topcon RE Super, an event that took the entire camera industry by surprise: This camera featured through-the lens (TTL) exposure metering, and at full lens aperture at that. The RE Super was fully prepared for professional work supported by a choice of lenses and accessories to complement it. The United States importer was the Charles Beseler Company and it was sold as the Beseler Topcon Super D.

A green-light for the 13 episode order was contingent on international financing for the project, which makes the series more economically feasible as a summer replacement.
Casting began in January 2010. In early February, casting announcements included Frank Grillo in a lead role, as well as Luke Mably, Janina Gavankar, and Chandra West having joined the cast. Late March 2010 castings included Marisol Nichols and Rhona Mitra in leading roles. Victoria Platt, Skyler Samuels and newcomer Justin Miles were also cast in the project. Paul Blackthorne will appear in a recurring role.
Filming began in Shreveport, Louisiana on March 29, 2010, and was expected to continue until August 2010. Original reports by Variety suggested that the series might be filmed overseas, with another outlet mentioning South America. The show has featured music by a variety of artists, including indie folk songwriter Quinn Marston.


== Series cancellation ==
Soon after the first season finished airing there were rumors that the show would not be returning for a second season. These rumors were further fueled by cast member Grillo's tweets suggesting that his contract was not going to be renewed. In October 2010 several of the show's stars confirmed that the show had indeed been canceled and that there would not be a second season.

117,"Rusticated concrete block is the handmade product of in-field advancements in cement making. These concrete blocks first appeared in the late 19th century and are used mainly in residences and small building construction and are meant to resemble rusticated stone blocks. Rusticated concrete block involves a rough surface with a carved bevel detail around the edge of the face of the block. The rough texture of the face is created by running the concrete across a cast-iron face plate or by using a plaster mold taken from a cut stone block. This process of texturing concrete block was streamlined by an inventor named Harmon S. Palmer who created a machine that combined the processes of texturing and forming the concrete blocks. Palmer’s integration of the rusticated concrete block forming processes allowed for the material to gain national notoriety and led to its eventual inclusion in the Sears kit homes.


== History ==
Due to its low cost, concrete was a popular replacement for stone as a structural building element. As a building material, concrete was historically consigned to unseen structural positions such as behind a veneer or in the basement, but evolutions in texturing technology produced concrete blocks that could perform aesthetically as well as structurally. Rusticated concrete blocks, often referred to as rock-faced concrete blocks, from then on were seen as a cost effective substitute for natural faced stone and from a reasonable distance could pass for the real thing. These rock-faced blocks were valued not only for their low cost but also for their natural fire resistance, sound absorption, and energy efficiency. Additionally, installment time was reduced as the irregularity of the faces eliminated the high level of precision needed in placing plain faced blocks.


=== Inclusion in Sears catalogs ===
The process of forming rusticated concrete blocks was simplified to the point that Sears was able to start selling concrete block machines in their catalogs to the general public. A catalog from 1939 offered two options for buyers interested in forming their own concrete blocks. The ""Wizard"" Concrete Block Machine was available for $32.95 and produced 8 x 8 x 16 inch blocks in a ""Medium rock-face design"". For $52.95, a prospective buyer could get the ""Triumph"" Concrete Block Machine which had the capacity of producing between 200 and 250 blocks per day.


== Difference between RCB & CMU ==
The differences between rusticated concrete blocks and concrete masonry units (CMU) are quite minimal. In fact, rusticated concrete blocks could be considered a type of concrete masonry unit. The main difference here is the treatment of the face of the concrete. As its name suggests, rusticated concrete block involves rustication. While architects may specify RCB as a cladding element, CMU is more often used in behind-the-scenes structural work.


== Present day use ==
More recently, concrete fabricators have achieved the rusticated look through a process of splitting double-sized blocks with a sharp angled blade. As the aesthetic value of textured concrete block has become recognized, sales have steadily risen and many manufacturers have come to refer to it as architectural concrete block. Architects have begun specifying these concrete blocks not only for back-up walls but for cladding as well. The discontinuation of the practice of using plaster molds has eliminated repetitive patterns across concrete block faces, that hinted at their illegitimacy as natural stone, and allowed for irregularity that casts a variation of light and shadows. Once seen as a building material only suitable for low-budget projects, concrete block, through these advancements in texturing and ornamentation, has become a highly desired conduit for architectural design.

127,"Covington County Schools is a public school district based in Covington County, Mississippi, which serves the towns of Collins, Seminary, and Mount Olive, as well as rural regions throughout the county. The district’s boundaries parallel that of Covington County. According to the Mississippi Department of Revenue, the school district millage rate is 36.31 out of 85.75 total mills; this accounts for 42.34 percent of the millage taxes.


== History ==
The first public school established in Covington County was in the Salem community. Little is known about the date of establishment, only that a Mr. James Hill led instruction. The legislature of Covington County passed an act in 1837 which created the now-defunct Male and Female Academy in present day Mt. Carmel. In subsequent years, the Legislature created further institutions for education: the Male and Female College (1841) in Williamsburg, MS and the Zion Seminary College (1846) at the present day site of Seminary Attendance Center. In the past, Covington County School District consisted of over 100 small, rural schools interspersed throughout the county. So many schools caused problems regarding funding, with superintendent N. B. Holcomb reporting in 1895 that ""funds are so divided as to place so little to each school that it don't [sic] amount to much after it is placed"". In addition, Holcomb mentions that during the time of the report, there were no secondary education schools located in the county, although the district planned for their development.
In the report to the Mississippi Department of Education, superintendent N. B. Holcomb also reports that the introduction of a Teachers' Institute and Teachers' Library into the district was ""the most factor in enabling teachers to secure prompt attendance and good deportment"". Indeed, it states that most successful teachers in the school district were the ones who used the least amount of corporal punishment.


== Desegregation ==
Throughout much of the history of Covington County, the school system was under de jure segregation. On December 12, 1966, the United States Department of Justice filed a case against the school district to challenge a ""freedom of choice"" school desegregation plan in place, which was combined in a suit against 25 other districts. Eventually, on November 7, 1969, the courts issued an order to desegregate the county schools. In 1970, sixteen years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, the Covington County School District began integration of its schools, with the exception of Hopewell Elementary. There was a small demonstration of approximately 25 parents, who gathered in front of three schools to picket the decision to integrate schools, as well as white students who stayed home. However, there was little white flight or protest in response to the move, in spite of ""an effort [by Citizens for Local Control of Education] to get 1,000 mothers in ... Covington County to picket against the massive integration orders..."" (Bolton, 2007).
Eventually, the case returned to the court system when it was discovered that 25 white students in the Hopewell zone were not attending the school. The Fifth Circuit required the district to modify attendance requirements so that all students in Hopewell would attend the school. After no activity for almost 30 years, the Department of Justice filed a motion for further relief that required Covington County Schools not use race for selection in extracurricular activities and develop non-discrimination policies to govern this. In addition, a settlement between the Department of Justice and Covington County Schools led to five major provisions which the county must follow:
Students in Hopewell Attendance zone attend Hopewell for grades K-6 and Seminary Attendance Center for grades 7-12
Publicize its majority-to-minority transfer program, which allows students in the majority race at a school to transfer to one where they are a minority
Establish an enrichment program at Hopewell to ""enhance education"" and ""encourage white students in other attendance zones"" to transfer there
Conduct facilities organization study and submit plans to build or renovate Seminary schools to the United States
Analyze all bus routes for Hopewell Attendance center to reduce time spent on buses as much as possible
The Department of Justice received annual reports from the school district throughout the 2010s. The case remains open as of April 2017.


== Notable Events ==


=== 1985 Teacher Strike ===
Along with teachers in Lamar County, Forrest County, and Stone County, instructors in Covington County participated in a strike against the Governor and Legislature, calling for the state to raise teacher salaries by $7,000 over two years. This occurred in spite of a restraining order against the strike, the latter being originally endorsed by the Mississippi Educator's Association. The endorsement was eventually rescinded, and the MEA joined the Mississippi American Federation of Teachers to advise against the strike.


=== Math Institute ===
During the 2003-2004 school year, as part of a project under No Child Left Behind, the University of Southern Mississippi selected Covington County Schools as one of eleven school districts to participate in its Math Institute. At the end, the hope was that the program would lead to a lower percentage of students scoring at the minimal and basic level on state achievement tests.


=== Adoption of CHART program ===
In 2012, the Covington County School Board adopted the CHART policy to teach sexual education. Mississippi First reports that this move allows ""all [Covington County] public school students in grades 6-9 ... access to evidence-based sex education this fall."" The adoption raised the number of Mississippi school districts participating in CHART to 30.


=== SPEPA Adopt-A-School Program ===
In 2017, Southern Pine Electric Power Association recently began a program to adopt various schools in their service areas. The company partnered with Hopewell Elementary as the first school to participate in this program to receive volunteers for projects and donations of school supplies. Under the new program, Southern Pine employees will work with teachers, parents, and community members to provide needed resources for students and young people.

=== Mississippi Academic Achievement Program Scores ===
Covington County Schools, as a whole, has consistently maintained a C average on the Mississippi Academic Achievement Program. However, as of the 2016-2017 school year, data indicates that the majority of schools in the county are rated at a D or lower. During the 2015-2016 school administration, the number of schools receiving a C or higher was exactly half of the number of schools receiving a D or lower. These are in contrast to previous years, which had the majority of schools in the county rated as a C or higher. The top three performing schools in the county are Collins High School, Seminary High School, and Seminary Elementary School, which all obtained a B as of the most recent assessments.


=== Four-Year Graduation Rates ===
According to a report by the Division of Research and Development at the Mississippi Department of Education, the school district's current graduation rates for general education students, 77.2%, are below Mississippi's 6-year average of 82.3%. However, district drop-out rates for general education students, at 10.5%, are slightly lower than the state's six-year average of 10.8%. Regarding students with disabilities, the graduation rate is 13.8%, significantly below the statewide graduation rate of 34.7%. The document does not mention drop-out rates for students with disabilities.

129,"Günter Schabowski (4 January 1929 – 1 November 2015) was an official of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutchlands abbreviated SED), the ruling party during most of the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Schabowski gained worldwide fame in November 1989 when he improvised a slightly mistaken answer to a press conference question, raising popular expectations much more rapidly than the government planned so that massive crowds gathered the same night at the Berlin Wall, forcing its opening after 28 years; soon after, the entire inner German border was opened.


== Background ==
Schabowski was born in Anklam, Pomerania (then in the Free State of Prussia, now part of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). He studied journalism at the Karl Marx University, Leipzig, after which he became editor of the trade union magazine, Tribüne. In 1952, he became a member of the SED. From 1967 to 1968, he visited the party academy of the CPSU. In 1978, he became the chief editor of the newspaper Neues Deutschland (""New Germany""), which as the official organ of the SED was considered to be the leading newspaper in the GDR. In 1981, he became a member of the SED Central Committee. In 1985, after leaving Neues Deutschland, he became the First Secretary of the East Berlin chapter of the SED and a member of the SED Politbüro. He also served as member of the Volkskammer from 1981 to 1990. In 2009, writer Christa Wolf called Schabowski ""one of the worst"" East German politicians before the Wende, saying: ""I remember a few appearances of him in front of the writer's guild. You were scared of him.""


== Tearing down the Berlin Wall ==

In October 1989, Schabowski, along with several other members of the Politbüro, turned on longtime SED leader Erich Honecker and forced him to step down in favor of Egon Krenz. As part of the effort to change the regime's image, Schabowski was named the regime's unofficial spokesman, and he held several daily press conferences to announce changes. He had already been in charge of media affairs for the Politbüro before then. He was also reportedly named the number-two man in the SED, Krenz' old role. Schabowski had spent most of his career in Communist-style journalism, in which reporters were told what to write after events had already happened. He thus found it somewhat difficult to get used to Western-style media practice.
On 9 November 1989, shortly before that day's press conference, Krenz handed Schabowski a text containing new, temporary travel regulations. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings—including those between East and West Berlin. The text was supposed to be embargoed until the next morning.
Schabowski had not been on hand when Krenz read the text earlier in the day to several Politbüro members during a cigarette break at that day's Central Committee plenum, nor had he been there when it was discussed before the full committee. However, he felt comfortable discussing it at the press conference; he later said that all one needed to do in order to conduct a press conference was be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes. Accordingly, he read the note aloud at the end of the press conference. One of the reporters asked when the regulations would come into effect. Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note, and replied after a few seconds' pause: ""As far as I know — effective immediately, without delay."" (German: Das trifft nach meiner Kenntnis … ist das sofort … unverzüglich.) Accounts differ on who asked that question. Both Riccardo Ehrman, the Berlin correspondent of the ANSA news agency, and German Bild Zeitung (a tabloid) reporter Peter Brinkmann were sitting on the front row at the press conference, and claimed to have asked when the regulations would come into force.
Later, when asked whether the new regulations also applied to travel between East and West Berlin, Schabowski looked at the text again and discovered that they did. When Daniel Johnson of The Daily Telegraph asked what that meant for the Berlin Wall, Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the Wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.
After the press conference, Schabowski sat down for a live interview with Brokaw. When Brokaw asked him if it was indeed true that East Germans could now travel without having to go through a third country, Schabowski replied in broken English that East Germans were ""not further forced to leave GDR by transit through another country,"" and could now ""go through the border."" When Brokaw asked if this meant ""freedom of travel,"" Schabowski replied, ""Yes of course,"" and added that it was not ""a question of tourism,"" but ""a permission of leaving GDR.""
The West German public national television channels showed parts of Schabowski's press conference in their main evening news reports at 7:17 PM on ZDF's heute and at 8 PM on ARD's Tagesschau; this meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany, where West German television was widely watched, as well. The news then spread like wildfire with news reports continuing to repeat the news throughout the night.
As the night progressed, thousands of East Berliners began proceeding to the six border crossings along the Berlin Wall. They demanded to be let through. Live TV reported on the gathering people which only increased the numbers of East Berliners coming to the gates. The crowds vastly outnumbered the border guards who initially tried to stall for time. However, no one was willing to order deadly force. Finally, at 11:30 pm, Stasi officer Harald Jäger decided to open the gates at the Bornholmer Straße border crossing and allow people into West Berlin.
The fall of the Berlin Wall was the key event leading to the end of the East German regime, a state that had been crumbling for many weeks as citizens had been fleeing through intermediate countries surrounding East Germany. Indeed, Sebestyen later wrote that when the gates were opened, for all intents and purposes East Germany ""ceased to exist."" He also wrote that many of Schabowski's colleagues suspected he was either an American or West German agent, and could not believe that he had made ""a simple cock-up."" In 2014, his wife claimed that Schabowski had been well aware of the possible consequences of what he said in the press conference.
In the following purges of the ""party's old guard"", Schabowski was quickly expelled from the Party of Democratic Socialism successor to the SED, in an attempt to improve the party's image. Just months earlier, he had been awarded the country's prestigious Order of Karl Marx.


== Political life after reunification ==

After German Reunification, Schabowski became highly critical of his own actions in the GDR and those of his fellow Politbüro members, as well as of Soviet-style socialism in general. He worked again as a journalist and, between 1992 and 1999, as editor for Heimat-Nachrichten, a weekly local paper that he co-founded with a West German journalist in Rotenburg an der Fulda.
His campaign help for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) prompted some of his former comrades to call him a wryneck (German term: Wendehals; a bird that can turn its head almost 180 degrees; popular term used to mock Communists who have turned capitalist).
Together with other leading figures of the GDR regime, he was charged with the murders of East Germans attempting to flee the GDR. In January 1995, the Berlin prosecutors pressed charges against him. In August 1997, Schabowski was convicted along with Egon Krenz and Günther Kleiber. Because he accepted his moral guilt and denounced the GDR, he was sentenced to only three years in prison. In December 1999, he began serving his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison in Spandau. However, in September 2000, he was pardoned by Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and released in December 2000, having served only a year. He was critical of the PDS/Left Party (i.e., successor of the Socialist Unity Party); in 2001, he collaborated with Bärbel Bohley as advisor of Frank Steffel (CDU).


== Death ==
According to his wife, Schabowski resided in a Berlin nursing home during the last years of his life, after a number of infections and strokes. He died in Berlin after a long illness on the morning of 1 November 2015, aged 86.

131,"Sister Machine Gun is an industrial rock band based in Chicago.


== History ==


=== The early years ===
Sister Machine Gun was formed by Chris Randall and Guilherme Machado in New York City. They performed at New Jersey's Pipeline, and New York's Limelight. The band went on a short hiatus after Chris Randall joined KMFDM's tour as a stage technician. After the tour, Randall left New York City and relocated to Chicago. He then found work in the mailroom of Wax Trax! Records, and began recording a demo with Jim Marcus and Van Christie of Die Warzau. The rough demo was given to Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM for mixing. Konietzko passed the demo along to Jim Nash, head of Wax Trax! Records, where Randall worked. The label then signed the band to a record deal.


=== The Wax Trax! Years ===
Sister Machine Gun's debut album Sins of the Flesh was released on Wax Trax! in 1992. During this time, Chris Randall assembled a group of musicians to tour in support of the album. Tom Gaul and Steve Stoll joined the band, alongside Kelly and Randall. Stoll left the band after this tour, and work on the next album began.
The Torture Technique was released in 1994. Tom Gaul left midway through the recording process, after contributing to the album. New members were recruited for the upcoming tour. Guitarist Greg Lucas (later a member of Final Cut) joined, as well as drummer Scott Churilla (later a member of The Reverend Horton Heat's band). Sister Machine Gun went on to join the Angstfest tour with KMFDM and Chemlab.
After this tour, Chris Kelly left the band. Prior to the recording of Burn, Sister Machine Gun went on another tour. The lineup during this time consisted of Chris Randall, bassist Bob Jones, drummer Tom DeSalvo (former member of Chemlab), and Chris Smits on guitar.
The band then began work on the album Burn. Guitarist Geno Lenardo (of Filter) joined in the studio. Burn was released in 1995. The title track became one of the band's most recognizable songs, as it later appeared on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack.
The tour line-up at this time consisted of Chris Randall, bassist Richard Deacon, and drummer Kevin Temple (formerly of Die Warzau and later Apartment 26). This line up remained mostly consistent throughout the touring for Burn and Metropolis, with guitarists Pat Sprawl and Brian Sarche joining at various times.
The final Sister Machine Gun album on Wax Trax!, Metropolis, was released in 1997. Reeves Gabrels did guitar work on the album.


=== The Positron! Years ===
After 1997's Metropolis album, Sister Machine Gun left Wax Trax. The rest of the band's material was released on Chris Randall's Positron! Records, the record label he founded and operates with his wife, Lisa. The band's sound changed considerably after their move to the new label.
In 2007, Sister Machine Gun officially disbanded and Chris Randall began a solo career.


=== New Material (2015) ===
On November 5, 2014, a Facebook Page for Sister Machine Gun was launched, along with a teaser image announcing the project's return in Spring of 2015 on WTII Records. This image was also shared on Chris Randall's personal Facebook account with the caption, ""Remember that thing I said I'd never do again? Yeah. I'm doing it. Spring '15 on WTII Records.""
On March 13, 2015, the band released The Future Unformed.


== Primary Member History ==
Guilherme Machado joined Randall in Chicago for the recording of the band's debut album, Sins of the Flesh. After recording some guitar parts, Machado left the band. After the completion of the album, Chris Kelly joined the band. After Kelly's departure in 1995, Randall continued the band primarily as a solo project. Miguel Turanzas joined the band in 1999, and continued as a member until it was disbanded in 2007.

132,"Kfar Uria (Hebrew: כְּפַר אוּרִיָּה‎, lit. Uriah Village) is a moshav in central Israel. Located near Beit Shemesh in the Shephelah. It falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In 2016 it had a population of 918.


== History ==
The village was first established in 1912 on land bought from Białystok Jews, and served as an agricultural training place. Amongst the residents were A. D. Gordon.
According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Kfar Uria had a population of 40 Jews. This had decreased in 1931 to 10 inhabitants, in 2 houses.
In the 1929 Palestine riots Arab rioters from Jerusalem attacked Kfar Uria, with some local help, robbed and burned down the village. The inhabitants of the adjacent Arab villages for the most part were on good terms with the village's residents and many treated the moshav's association director, Baruch Yakimovsky, as their mukhtar (village chief). He was on amicable terms with mukhtars in surrounding villages. The farmers of the area, both Jews and Arabs, cooperated and defended each other against raiding nomadic Bedouin.
Six Jewish families who had stayed behind were later smuggled out by the mukhtar of Beit Far via one of the ancient natural tunnels that crisscrosses the area. Yakimovsky managed, with the cooperation of some local mukhtars to work Kfar Uria's land for a few more years. In 1944, Jewish stonecutters from Kurdistan rebuilt the village on the ruins of the original site, around 1.5 km north-west Khirbat Ism Allah, but not on village land.
The new village was attacked on 11 January 1948, but repelled by a combination of a Palmach force and an armoured British unit. Haganah guards murdered without provocation an Arab peasant couple near the village soon after, in February of that year. A third attempt to settle the area was undertaken in 1949, when a moshav was established on the site. The village name is similar to that of Khirbet Cafarorie, a ruin located south - west of the village, which had a hewn winepress, a mosaic and burial caves.
The village center features an old Khan, which once hosted the agricultural training workers, including A. D. Gordon. The Khan structure remains to this day at the heart of the community, but it requires renovations and therefore closed to visitors.
Between 2009 and 2011 a new neighborhood was built and populated with 69 new houses and families.


== Landmarks ==
In 1970, Israeli artist Avraham Ofek created a mural for the community center at Kfar Uria. The mural, which covers three walls, each 12.5 meters long and three meters high, tells the story of Israel focusing on the themes of immigration, building the country, and family and Jewish tradition.

134,"In mathematics, the Ahlfors conjecture, now a theorem, states that the limit set of a finitely-generated Kleinian group is either the whole Riemann sphere, or has measure 0.
The conjecture was introduced by Ahlfors (1966), who proved it in the case that the Kleinian group has a fundamental domain with a finite number of sides. Canary (1993) proved the Ahlfors conjecture for topologically tame groups, by showing that a topologically tame Kleinian group is geometrically tame, so the Ahlfors conjecture follows from Marden's tameness conjecture that hyperbolic 3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental groups are topologically tame (homeomorphic to the interior of compact 3-manifolds). This latter conjecture was proved, independently, by Agol (2004) and by Calegari & Gabai (2006).
Canary (1993) also showed that in the case when the limit set is the whole sphere, the action of the Kleinian group on the limit set is ergodic.

135,"Dungannon, (aka ""Duncannon""), was a thoroughbred racehorse owned by the tobacco planter and horse breeder George Hume Steuart (1700–1784), who imported the horse from England to race against his rival, Charles Carroll of Annapolis (1703–1783). Dungannon won the Annapolis Subscription Plate, in May 1743, the first recorded formal horse race in colonial Maryland, and the second oldest in North America.


== History ==

The Annapolis Subscription Plate was held in May 1743 at Parole, Maryland, near Annapolis, on the South River, at a site which eventually became the Parole Hunt Club. Charles Carroll of Annapolis (whose son, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, would later sign the Declaration of Independence in 1776) had wagered Steuart that his horse would win in a 3-mile race. In the 1740s racing was established in almost every large town in Maryland, with many gentlemen of means establishing large studs. The Maryland Jockey Club was founded in Annapolis in 1743, and racing soon came to form an important part of the social and political life of the colony.
At stake was the Annapolis Subscription Plate, today the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland and the second oldest horseracing trophy in America. The silver plate itself - in reality more of a bowl than a plate - was donated to the Baltimore Museum of Art by Mrs Alice Key Montell and Mrs Sarah Steuart Hartshorne, where it is now on display. It was crafted by the Annapolis silversmith John Inch (1721–1763).


== Legacy ==

A solid silver replica of similar weight and dimensions mirroring the original Annapolis Subscription Plate was commissioned in 1955 by the Maryland Jockey Club. The replica, known as ""The Dungannon Bowl"", is a perpetual trophy given annually to the winner of the Dixie Stakes, the oldest stakes race run in Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic states.
The Annapolis Subscription Plate has also been revived in recent years by the descendants of Dungannon's former owner, Dr George Hume Steuart, who still live at Steuart's former tobacco plantation, Dodon, today. The commemorative race was held at Roedown Farm, Davidsonville, Maryland in 2010.

136,"Alber Elbaz (Hebrew: אלבר אלבז‎; born 1961) is a Moroccan-Israeli fashion designer. Elbaz worked for the Paris fashion house Lanvin from 2001 until October 2015.


== Biography ==
Alber Elbaz was born in 1961 in Casablanca, Morocco. He immigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 10 and grew up in Holon. After serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, he studied at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design in Ramat Gan. His life partner is Alex Koo, Lanvin's director of marketing.


== Fashion Career ==
Elbaz began designing for Lanvin in 2001. In October 2015, he announced that he had been let go from the fashion house since he disagreed with the company's major shareholder, Shaw-Lan Wang. Elbaz also complained about the lack of strategy and targeted investement of the company.
He designed all of the costumes Natalie Portman wore in the film A Tale of Love and Darkness which she also wrote and directed.


== Art and graphics ==

In 2006, Elbaz introduced new packaging for Lanvin, featuring a light forget-me-not blue color, a favorite shade which Lanvin purportedly had seen in a Fra Angelico fresco. Packaging included shopping bags imprinted with Paul Iribe's 1907 illustration of Lanvin and her daughter Marguerite, and shoe boxes designed like antique library files, tied with black ribbons to emphasize the precious nature of the product.
Elbaz illustrated the song ""Lady Jane"" in singer-songwriter Mika's extended play Songs for Sorrow.
In 2012, Rizzoli published a book of 3,000 photographs documenting Elbaz's work for Lanvin.

137,"Klara Löbenstein (15 February 1883 – ?) was a German mathematician. She was among the first women to obtain a doctorate in Germany. Her doctoral work was on the topology of algebraic curves.


== Life and work ==
Löbenstein was born in Hildesheim, Prussia on 15 February 1883 to merchant Lehmann Löbenstein and his wife Sofie (née Schönfeld).
In 1904, Löbenstein was given permission to take her Abitur at the Realgymnasium I Gymnasium in Hanover. Thus she belonged to a small group of talented young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the Abitur externally at boys' schools.
Since Prussia began to allow women to formally attend university only from the winter semester of 1908–09, Löbenstein and her friend Margarete Kahn first attended the universities of Berlin and Göttingen as guest students. They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and Göttingen. Löbenstein's field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with Kahn she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem. Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. Löbenstein and Kahn developed methods to address this problem.
Löbenstein obtained a doctorate in 1910 under David Hilbert in Göttingen, with a dissertation titled Über den Satz, daß eine ebene, algebraische Kurve 6. Ordnung mit 11 sich einander ausschließenden Ovalen nicht existiert [On the proposition that no plane algebraic curve of degree 6 with 11 mutually exclusive ovals exists], and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then). She took her oral examination – again, along with Kahn – on 30 June 1909. Afterwards Löbenstein worked as a high school teacher in Metz and Landsberg. She was dismissed on 1 January 1936 due to the Nazi racial laws. In 1941 she emigrated to Argentina.

The lemma is one of key ingredients in developing the intersection theory, as it is used to show the uniqueness of the theory.
Even if Z is an effective cycle, it is not in general possible to choose the cycle Z' to be effective.

== Early years and education ==
Peek was born January 26, 1900, in Palatka, Putnam County, Florida, to Gouverneur Frank Peek and Rebecca Medwin Hyde. His father died the year after his birth. He and his mother lived with his maternal grandmother, Anne Elizabeth Copcutt Hyde in DeLand, and two other spinster Grand Aunts thereafter. Peek graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Stetson University in 1920. He then studied at Harvard University (Master in Architecture, 1924), his senior thesis being ""A Casino at De Leon Springs."" His Harvard education included two years of study in Italy. After serving as artist of record on an archaeological team at Deir el Baḥri, in Egypt (1924–1925), Peek then returned to Florida to begin architectural practice in DeLand. He did the major design for the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., when he worked for the John Russell Pope Architectural firm. He was commissioned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to draw sketches of the King Tutankhamen digs, shortly after graduating from Harvard.


== Practice in DeLand, Florida ==
Peek designed many landmark structures in DeLand, including the old City Hall and the civic band shell. Peek also created notable homes in DeLand's University Terrace neighborhood. The subdivision is contained by Amelia, Garfield, Oakdale and University Avenues. It was platted in late 1925 by Harry W. Prahl, who was a contractor from Erie, Pennsylvania. and who employed Peek as consulting architect between 1926 and 1928. The development comprised the styles popular in Florida at the time, with Tudor and Colonial designs on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue and those with Mediterranean and Mission revival to the north.
Medwin Peek was a childhood friend of Bert Fish and served as the architect of the Fish Memorial Hospitals. His address, at 714 N. Woodland Blvd., DeLand, FL, is now part of the campus of First Presbyterian Church, DeLand.


== Personal life ==
Peek married Alleyne Caroline Foster (4 Aug. 1906, Springfield, Windsor, Vermont - 24 Jul 1989, Longwood, Seminole, Florida) on 25 Aug 1927 in Daytona Beach, Volusia, Florida.

Until 1989, VMGRT-253 was also the Fleet Replacement Enlisted Skills Training Center (FREST), tasked with training all the KC-130 maintenance crew Marines and Sailors. As the Model Manager for maintenance training, VMGRT-253 consolidated East and West Coast technical schools into a new 43,000-square-foot (4,000 m2) facility.


== History ==
The squadron was activated on October 1, 1986 as Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Training Squadron 253 (VMGRT-253). They received their first C-130 Hercules aircraft, bureau number 149803 on November 20, 1986. The squadron held its official commissioning ceremony on January 30, 1987.

In addition to improving the aircrew and maintenance personnel of 10 Navy and Marine Corps squadrons, VMGRT-253 stands ready to augment forward deployed operational units. During Operation Desert Storm VMGRT-253 was tasked with providing tankers to requalify numerous fixed wing jet pilots in aerial refueling prior to deploying to the desert. Additionally, after Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, VMGRT-253 crews and aircraft provided disaster relief support. In March 1996 the Titans completed their first ever full deployment. While deployed in Key West for two weeks the squadron carried out all normal assignments and flew an aggressive flight schedule.
In 2000, VMGRT-253 broke new ground when it became the first Marine Corps squadron to receive the KC-130J. The J-Flight Introduction Team (JFIT) was formed and the squadron was tasked with building a training program and training the aircrews. December 20, 2002, VMGRT-253 transferred its KC-130J’s and personnel to VMGR-252. In 2005, VMGRT-253 flew 67 sorties and 137.2 hours, carrying 405,911 lb (184,118 kg) of cargo and 236 passengers in support of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. The squadron also aided the evacuation efforts of aircraft and personnel aboard MCAS Cherry Point during Hurricane Ophelia to Wright-Patterson AFB.
The squadron was officially deactivated during a ceremony on September 14, 2006. LtCol Adam Holmes (the last commander of the unit) cased the unit colors, which were placed in storage.


== Safety ==
With the most diverse training requirements in the Marine Corps, the squadron has achieved impressive milestones. Since its commissioning, VMGRT-253 has flown over 19 years without a class “A” mishap while teaching the least experienced aircrew, making over 5000 landings a year and achieving 55,000 total flight hours in the oldest aircraft in the Fleet. The Titans have received awards for both safety and community service. VMGRT-253 has received 8 consecutive Fleet Marine Force Aviation Safety Awards and 2 Commandant’s Unit Awards for mishap free flight time.

147,"The epi tōn deēseōn (Greek: ὁ ἐπὶ τῶν δεήσεων, ""the one in charge of petitions"") was a Byzantine office, whose holder was responsible for receiving and answering petitions to the Byzantine emperor. Subordinate officials with the same title also existed in the provinces, and the Patriarch of Constantinople also had an epi ton deeseon.
The office is usually considered (cf. Bury) as the direct continuation of the late Roman magister memoriae, but this identification is not certain. The title is first attested in a 7th-century seal. In the lists of precedence like the Klētorologion, he was counted among the judicial officials (kritai), and surviving seals show that until the 11th century, its holders held relatively mid-ranking dignities, no higher than protospatharios. From the latter half of the 11th century however and during the 12th, the office rose much in importance, with its holders receiving higher titles and being drawn from among the Empire's nobility. The last named holder, George Chatzikes, is attested in 1321, but the office is still mentioned as active decades later by pseudo-Kodinos.
It is unknown if he had a dedicated staff (officium), or what its composition may have been; it is absent in the Klētorologion, but a seal of a probably subordinate ""notary of the petitions"" (notarios tōn deēseōn) is known. Seals also attest to the existence of provincial officials titled epi ton deeseon, as in Sicily and the Peloponnese.

It has a working relationship with fellow mixed martial arts promotion Deep presided by Shigeru Saeki (also the Jewels supervisor).


== History ==
After the women MMA promotion Smackgirl faced severe financial difficulties caused by the unexpected departure of major sponsors and television network deals, an executive from Japanese event production company Archery Inc., Yuichi Ozono, formed the company Marverous Japan and acquired the assets and rights formerly belonging to Smackgirl parent company Kilgore. Since the reputation of Smackgirl was tarnished by all the problems it faced, it was decided to start anew.
On June 9, 2012, it was announced that Jewels has formed a strategic partnership with American promotion Invicta Fighting Championships to cross-promote the world’s top female fighters on their respective fight cards in the United States and Japan.
On May 25, 2013 (2013-05-25) Jewels announced that it would cease operations as an independent company, with Yuichi Ozono, then head of Jewels, stepping down and Shigeru Saeki from Deep, formerly supervisor, taking the full direction, and transferring fighters and brand to the new Deep Jewels brand, which would be managed by Deep.

151,"Retrograde condensation occurs when gas in a tube is compressed beyond the point of condensation with the effect that the liquid evaporates again. This is the opposite of condensation: the so-called retrograde condensation.


== Description ==
If the volume of two gases that are kept at constant temperature and pressure below critical conditions is gradually reduced, condensation will start. When a certain volume is reached, the amount of condensation will gradually increase upon further reduction in volume until the gases are liquefied. If the composition of the gases lies between their true and pseudo critical points the condensate formed will disappear on continued reduction of volume. This disappearance of condensation is called retrograde condensation.
Because most natural gas found in petroleum reservoirs is not a pure product, when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical pressure/temperature conditions (i.e., the pressure in the reservoir decreases below dewpoint), condensate liquids may form during the isothermic depressurizing, an effect called retrograde condensation.


== Discovery ==
Johannes Petrus Kuenen discovered retrograde condensation and published his findings in April 1892 with the title ""Metingen betreffende het oppervlak van Van der Waals voor mengsels van koolzuur en chloormethyl"" (Measurements on the surface of Van der Waals for mixtures of carbonic acid and methyl chloride).

152,"The Tolkien Society is an educational charity and literary society devoted to the study and promotion of the life and works of the author and academic J. R. R. Tolkien.


== History ==
In the November 1969 issue of The Middle Earthworm, a letters of comment fanzine mainly aimed at British members of the Tolkien Society of America, Vera Chapman announced ""if not quite the birth, at least the hopeful conception of a Tolkien Society of Britain"". This was supplemented by a personal column by Chapman in the New Statesman published on 7 November which ran ""TOLKIEN SOCIETY of Britain — write Belladonna Took [Chapman's pseudonym], c/o Chapman, 21 Harrington House, Stanhope St. London NW1"". Since this would have hit news-stands a day before publication, the Tolkien Society's informal beginning has been placed at Thursday 6 November 1969.
The Tolkien Society gradually took shape over the following years. December 1969 saw the publication of Belladonna's Broadsheet, which after three issues was replaced by The Mallorn in October 1970. This was conceived as a quarterly publication, and the first issue was joined by The Tolkien Society Bulletin, which was to be produced on a six-weekly basis. The Society's official bulletin was replaced in January 1972 with Anduril, but was quickly supplanted by Henneth Annûn after three issues (the first had been numbered 0 and it continued independently until issue number 7). This new publication changed its name to Amon Hen with the second issue, seemingly for no particular reason. It, together with Mallorn (the definite article having being dropped from issue 2), are still published by the Tolkien Society.
The ""inaugural"" meeting of the Tolkien Society was hosted by the Hobbit Society of University College London (UCL) on 29 January 1970, where the name of the new society was discussed and the first committee was appointed. A constitution was considered at the first general meeting of the Tolkien Society on 20 November 1970 at UCL, but was ultimately rejected. The Tolkien Society did not become a legal entity until a constitution was finally ratified on 15 January 1972. It later obtained charitable status in England and Wales on 7 July 1977.
An AGM has been held each year since 1972, and since 1973 has featured a talk from a guest speaker. It is one of the three main annual Tolkien Society events, the largest and most popular being ""Oxonmoot"". In the December 1973 issue of the fanzine Nazgul, contributor John Abbot asked, ""[w]hat do you think of the idea of Oxford Moot this year?"" The 1974 AGM approved the idea, and the first Oxonmoot met at The Welsh Pony 13–15 September later that year. The first (near-)annual Tolkien Society ""workshop"" was held on 22 March 1986, morphing into the ""Tolkien Society Seminar"" from 1989 onward. The more informal ""Summermoot"" was held on an irregular basis in the 1980s and 1990s, occasionally hosted by Joanna Tolkien and Hugh Baker at their farm in Wales. According to their son (and Tolkien's great-grandson) Royd Tolkien,

As a family, we’ve always been involved with The Tolkien Society and when I was a kid they used to come up to our small farm in Wales for Summer Moots. They’d dress up as characters, camp in the field, sword flight, let off homemade fireworks and have huge campfires. The first awareness of the legacy came from those fun times.

The Tolkien Society has also organized a number of major conferences to celebrate significant Tolkienian anniversaries. ""The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference"" at Keble College, Oxford, marked one-hundred years since Tolkien's birth in 1992. ""Tolkien 2005: The Ring Goes Ever On"" celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of The Lord of the Rings at Aston University, Birmingham. ""The Return of the Ring: Celebrating Tolkien in 2012"" marked seventy-five years since the publication of The Hobbit at Loughborough University, and received a special video message from director Peter Jackson and artists John Howe and Alan Lee.


== Contact with J. R. R. Tolkien ==
Vera Chapman first contacted J. R. R. Tolkien on behalf of the Tolkien Society upon the suggestion of Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary during the 1960s. On 1 May 1970 she wrote Tolkien a letter introducing the Society and its aims. Later, following the announcement that Tolkien had been awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours, the Society sent Tolkien a telegram on his eightieth birthday on 3 January 1972. The Society also sent him a gift of tobacco in a green china jar, along with a congratulatory note. That evening, Joy Hill telephoned Chapman to say that ""[o]f all the tributes he [Tolkien] received, this was the one that gave the greatest pleasure. There was a chance he might write personally."" And, on 6 February, he did:

Dear Mrs. Chapman,
May I thank you and the Tolkien Society for your good wishes and kind gift on my 80th birthday. I appreciated your generosity very much indeed.
Best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
J.R.R. Tolkien [signed]

Later that year, Chapman met Tolkien in person. On 27 June, she was invited to a sherry party hosted by Tolkien's publishing firm George Allen & Unwin. During their brief exchange, she asked Tolkien if he would consent to become the Society's honorary president. ""Certainly"", he responded, ""[i]f I can help your society in any way, I will."" Tolkien died the following year. Upon offering the presidency to Christopher Tolkien, he wrote back suggesting that his father could remain president in perpetuity. This was agreed at the following Annual General Meeting held at the Ivanhoe Hotel in London on 16 February 1974.


== Activities ==


=== Events ===
The Tolkien Society currently organizes five events on an annual basis:
The Birthday Toast is held on Tolkien's birthday on 3 January. The Society asks fans across the world to raise a toast to ""The Professor"" at 9pm their local time. Many local groups (or ""smials"") hold their own Birthday Toast events. In recent years the event has become social media orientated, with fans sharing pictures of themselves raising a toast to Tolkien on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
Tolkien Reading Day is held on the anniversary of the downfall of Sauron on 25 March. It aims to promote the reading of Tolkien-based around a particular theme chosen each year by the Tolkien Society committee. The idea was first proposed to the Society by Sean Kirst, a journalist at the Syracuse, New York The Post-Standard, in 2002 and the first Tolkien Reading Day was set for 25 March 2003.
The AGM and Springmoot is held over a weekend in April. Although the Annual General Meeting is the main aspect of the event, the weekend also includes the semi-formal Annual Dinner followed by a talk from a guest speaker. As the AGM and Springmoot changes location each year, it is an opportunity for members to spend the rest of the weekend exploring local attraction sites.
The Tolkien Society Seminar is a day-long event held over the summer, consisting of a series of papers on a selected theme.
Oxonmoot is held on a weekend near to Bilbo and Frodo's birthday on 22 September. It is a conference-cum-convention held in an Oxford college since 1991. With around 200 attendees, it features academic lectures, quizzes, costuming, and a memorial service at Tolkien's grave in Wolvercote cemetery.


=== Publications ===

Membership of the Tolkien Society includes a subscription to the bulletin Amon Hen and journal Mallorn. The former is published six times a year, while the latter is published once a year. Mallorn tends to be more scholarly than Amon Hen, although the range of content has varied over the years. Prominent contributors include Christopher Tolkien, Priscilla Tolkien, and Tom Shippey.
Quettar was the bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society between 1980 and 1995, running for forty-nine issues before being wound up.
The Tolkien Society has also published a number of one-off publications, including the proceedings of the 1992 and 2005 conferences. Its ""Peter Roe"" series of books are published irregularly, and tend to print proceedings of seminars and talks by guest speakers.


=== Local groups ===
Local groups affiliated to the Tolkien Society are known as ""smials"", the name used for hobbit-holes in The Lord of the Rings. One smial at the University of Cambridge, known as the ""Cambridge Tolkien Society"" and ""Minas Tirith"", has published the open access journal Anor since the 1980s.


=== Tolkien to the World ===
The Tolkien to the World programme raises funds to send Tolkien books to schools and libraries across the world. Its aim is ""to work towards a situation where everyone in the world has access to Tolkien’s principal works of fiction"".


=== Archive ===
The Tolkien Society Archive maintains a large number of Tolkien books and journals together with a collection of ephemera such a press clippings and responses (both commercial and creative) to Tolkien which might not otherwise be preserved.


=== Plaques and memorials ===
The Tolkien Society has funded a number of blue plaques at places of significance in Tolkien's life. These include:
Sarehole Mill in Birmingham, a location adjacent to one of Tolkien's childhood homes and the inspiration behind Ted Sandyman's mill in The Lord of the Rings. In 2015, the Tolkien Society and Birmingham Museums Trust announced a partnership to promote Sarehole Mill and its connection to Tolkien.
4 Highfield Road in Birmingham, Tolkien's home between January 1910 and Autumn 1911.
The Plough and Harrow Hotel in Birmingham, where Tolkien stayed with his new wife Edith on 3 June 1916 shortly before leaving for war service in France.
2 Darnley Road in Leeds, the Tolkien family home between 17 March 1924 and 4 January 1926.
The 1992 Centenary Conference, organized by the Tolkien Society and the Mythopoeic Society, sponsored a memorial to Tolkien in Oxford University Parks. This involved the installation of a bench with an accompanying plaque and the planting of two trees representing Telperion and Laurelin from The Silmarillion.


=== Awards ===
The Tolkien Society Awards were established in 2014 to ""recognise excellence in the fields of Tolkien scholarship and fandom"". The awards are held annually and are announced at the Annual Dinner during the Society's AGM and Springmoot weekend. Past winners include authors Christopher Tolkien, Tom Shippey, and John Garth, and artist Jenny Dolfen.

154,"The Treaty of Kiel (Norwegian: Kieltraktaten) or Peace of Kiel (Swedish and Norwegian: Kielfreden or freden i Kiel) was concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Sweden on one side and the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway on the other side on 14 January 1814 in Kiel. It ended the hostilities between the parties in the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, where the United Kingdom and Sweden were part of the anti-French camp (the Sixth Coalition) while Denmark–Norway was allied to Napoleon Bonaparte.
Frederick VI of Denmark joined the anti-French alliance, ceded Heligoland to George III of the United Kingdom, and further ceded the Kingdom of Norway to Charles XIII of Sweden in return for Swedish Pomerania. Specifically excluded from the exchange were the Norwegian dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which remained in the union with Denmark. Norway unsuccessfully contested the Danish claim to all of Greenland in the Eastern Greenland Case of 1931–33.
However, not all provisions of the treaty would come into force. Norway declared its independence, adopted a constitution and elected Crown Prince Christian Frederik as its own king. Sweden therefore refused to hand over Swedish Pomerania, which instead passed to Prussia after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. After a short war with Sweden, Norway accepted entering into a personal union with Sweden at the Convention of Moss. King Christian Frederik abdicated after convening an extraordinary Storting, which revised the Constitution to allow for the Union. It was formally established when the Storting elected Charles XIII as king of Norway on 4 November 1814.


== Background ==

In the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway and the Kingdom of Sweden tried to maintain neutrality but soon became involved in the fighting, joining opposite camps. Swedish king Gustav IV Adolf entered an alliance with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Russian Empire against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804, and declared war on Napoleonic France in 1805. The United Kingdom, which had declared war on France in 1803, paid subsidies to Sweden. Before Gustav IV Adolf marched his forces out of Swedish Pomerania, a province long coveted by Prussia, he negotiated an agreement that Prussia would not attack it. Denmark remained neutral.

In 1807, Napoleonic forces seized Swedish Pomerania and forced Prussia and Russia to sign the Treaty of Tilsit. Russia was therein obliged to attack Napoleon's enemies, and since Gustav IV Adolf refused to break his alliance with the United Kingdom, the tsar invaded Finland and severed it from Sweden in the Finnish War, 1808/1809. Sweden could no longer uphold her anti-French foreign policy, and French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was elected heir to the Swedish throne in 1810. Denmark-Norway entered an alliance with France after the second British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807.
In 1812, Napoleon's forces were decimated in their failed attempt to subdue Russia, and started their westward retreat. Sweden allied with Russia on 30 August 1812, with the United Kingdom on 3 March 1813, and with Prussia on 22 April 1813. Previously, on 23 March 1813, she had declared war on Napoleon. Bernadotte's condition for entering the anti-Napoleonic alliance was the gain of Norway, which the United Kingdom and Russia accepted in May 1813. Prussia however did not acknowledge this claim at first. Thus, Bernadotte hesitated to enter the war with full force, and only engaged in a campaign against Hamburg which on 30 June was re-conquered by allied French and Danish forces. When Prussia finally accepted the Swedish claim to Norway on 22 July, Sweden joined the alliance of Reichenbach concluded between Russia, the United Kingdom and Prussia on 14/15 June. With three armies (North, Main and Silesian, the Northern army under Bernadotte's command), the allies subsequently cleared Northern Germany of French forces. Denmark, who had maintained the alliance with Napoleon because of the Swedish claim to Norway, was isolated and, as a consequence of the war, bankrupt.


== Dano-British treaty ==
The treaty between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was negotiated by Danish diplomat Edmund Bourke (Burke) and the British envoy at the Swedish court, Edward Thornton. It consisted of 14 articles, to which two articles were added in Brussels on 7 April.

In article III, the United Kingdom was obliged to return all occupied Danish possessions to the Danish king. Excepted was the island of Heligoland, where the British king was granted ""full and unlimited sovereignty"".
In article VI, the Danish king joined the anti-Napoleonic alliance, and obliged himself to maintain an army of 10,000 men that was to be joined to the Allied forces in Northern Germany and likewise be commanded by the Swedish crown prince. This Danish contingent was to be treated the same way the Swedish contingent was treated, and the Danish king was to receive an annual 400,000 pounds of British subsidies for maintenance and pay of the army, to be paid in monthly installments as soon as the army entered Allied service.
Article VIII was concerned with the abolishment of slave trade. In article X, the British king promised the Danish king to negotiate further compensation for Denmark's territorial cessions to Sweden in a pending final peace. In article XIII, older Dano-British treaties were confirmed.
The articles added in Brussels were concerned with the property of Danish subjects in the colonies or in ceded territories, which was to remain untouched by the British for the next three years, and equal treatment of Danish, British and Hanoveranian subjects, who were not to be prosecuted because of their participation in the war on different sides, nor because of their political or religious beliefs.


== Dano-Swedish treaty ==

The treaty between the Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Sweden was negotiated by Danish diplomat Edmund Bourke (Burke) and Swedish envoy Baron Gustaf af Wetterstedt with British mediation. It consisted of 28 articles and one separate article. In article III, the Danish king promised to join the alliance against Napoleonic France, and with reference to the Dano-British treaty confirms his obligation to put part of his army under Swedish command.
In article IV, the Danish king in his and his successors' name ""irrevocably and forever"" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favor of the Swedish king. The Norwegian kingdom was defined as consisting of the bishoprics of Christiansand, Bergen, Akershus and Trondheim, as well as the coastal islands and the northern regions of Nordland and Finnmark to the Russian border. Excepted were Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The Norwegian subjects were freed of their obligations to the Danish king. In article VI, the Swedish crown took over the debts and financial obligations of Norway, which was to be determined by a joint Dano-Swedish commission.
Article VII ruled that Swedish Pomerania was to be handed over to Denmark. In article XV, it was ruled that the Swedish forces were to take over the Norwegian fortresses as soon as the treaty was ratified, and that they were to abandon Swedish Pomerania as soon as the Norwegian fortresses Fredriksten, Fredrikstad, Kongsvinger and Akershus were handed over. In article XIII, the Swedish king promised the Danish king to negotiate full compensation for the cession of Norway in a pending final peace, and the cession of Swedish Pomerania is described as a ""proof"" of this intention.

In article XII, the king of Sweden promised to maintain the Norwegian University of Christiania, and the Pomeranian University of Greifswald, which was to pass to Denmark according to article VII, and confirmed donations made before the exchange. Also, it was agreed in article XX that subjects of the Danish king could choose within the next six years whether they would finally settle in Norway or Denmark, whereby property in the realm which would not become the permanent residence was to be sold only to inhabitants of this realm. This provision was also enacted with respect to Swedish Pomerania. In article XVI, it was agreed that the governors general and all foreign-born officials of the exchanged territories, as long as they did not decide to remain, were removed from their offices. Article XXI obliged the Danish administration to hand over all civilian and military administrative documents and archives concerning Norway.
Article XVII provided for a mutual exchange of all prisoners of war. According to article XV, allied troops were to leave the Danish Duchy of Schleswig (Slesvig), but were allowed to remain in the German confederal Duchy of Holstein (Holsten), ruled in personal union with Denmark and Schleswig, to participate in the encirclement of Hamburg. In article XXVII, former Dano-Swedish peaces were confirmed as long as their provisions were not in conflict with the treaty of Kiel, namely the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), the Treaty of Stockholm (June 1720), the Treaty of Frederiksborg (July 1720) and the Treaty of Jönköping (1809). A separate article was concerned with the cession of hostilities.


== Impact ==


=== The personal union of Sweden and Norway ===

On hearing news of the treaty, which became known through proclamation at the end of January, and published in Norwegian newspapers soon after, Norwegians were in disarray, and many called for arms, having beaten the Swedes only five years prior, in the 1809 campaign. A virtual independence movement had been established as early as 1810, and this movement gained momentum in the brooding situation. The Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, Christian Frederick, the resident viceroy in Norway, used this opportunity to intervene. He took the helm in the Norwegian independence movement, most likely with the surreptitious goal of re-unification with Denmark. This was not in the interest of all Norwegians. In fact, the founders of the 1810 movement lobbied for an independent Norway. The initiative of Christian Frederick was successful, partly due to clandestine support from the Danish Crown, but also because it was supported by prominent and influential Norwegians. They convinced the Prince that it would be unwise to claim the throne as his inheritance. Instead they advised him to assume the regency and call an election of representatives to a constituent assembly.
On 10 April the national assembly met at Eidsvoll to decide on a Constitution. Norway eventually declared independence on 17 May 1814, electing Christian Frederick as King. (The seventeenth of May is ""Syttende mai"" or Norwegian Constitution Day that is celebrated by Norwegians at home and abroad.) This triggered a short war with Sweden in which Sweden's financial advantage proved too much to overcome. Nevertheless, when cease-fire talks began, Bernadotte made an important concession—he accepted the newly adopted Norwegian constitution, thus giving up any claim that Norway was to be treated as merely a Swedish province. In accordance with the Convention of Moss, Norway agreed to enter a personal union with Sweden. After having made the necessary amendments to the constitution, the Norwegian Storting on 4 November elected Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway, creating the union between Sweden and Norway.


=== Swedish Pomerania ===

Due to the refusal of Norway to subordinate itself to the Swedish king, Charles XIII of Sweden did not hand over Swedish Pomerania to Frederick VI of Denmark. The problem was solved at the Congress of Vienna, when the Great Powers followed a plan worked out by Karl August von Hardenberg, prime minister of the Kingdom of Prussia, who proposed a ring exchange of territories and payments between the Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Hanover (ruled in personal union with Great Britain and Ireland), the Kingdom of Prussia and the Kingdom of Sweden.
According to Hardenberg's plan, Prussia ceded East Frisia with Emden to Hanover, and in exchange received from Hanover the Duchy of Lauenburg. This duchy was then handed over from Prussia to Denmark, along with an additional payment of 3.5 million talers. Prussia also took over a Danish debt to Sweden of 600,000 talers, and agreed on an additional payment of 2 million talers to Sweden. Denmark and Sweden in turn relinquished their claims to Swedish Pomerania in favour of Prussia. Charles XIII of Sweden then released his Pomeranian subjects from their obligations towards Sweden on 1 October 1815, and on 23 October the province was handed over to von Ingersleben, president of Prussian Pomerania.


=== East Greenland case ===

Between 1931 and 1933, Norway contested the Danish possession of all of Greenland at the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. As of December 2008, this was the only case where possession of a polar territory was ever decided by an international court.
The Norwegian side argued that Denmark did not hold rights to any part of the island where she did not exact actual sovereignty, and accordingly proclaimed a Norwegian Eirik Raudes Land in eastern Greenland on 10 July 1931, which had been occupied in the previous month. On 5 April 1933 however, the court ruled that on the basis of the Treaty of Kiel and subsequent treaties, Denmark was the sovereign over the whole of Greenland.

155,"Blessed Margaretha Flesch (24 February 1826 - 25 March 1906) was a German Roman Catholic professed religious who established the Franciscan Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Angels. Flesch assumed the new religious name of ""Maria Rosa"" after she made her profession into her own order and was its first Mother Superior.
She tended to the poor and to the ill as well as orphaned children before becoming a nun and also oversaw the construction of both an orphanage and a hospital. Flesch also had practical experience in nursing and worked as a home nurse and a nurse to children.
Her beatification was celebrated on 4 May 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI approved a singular miracle attributed to her; Cardinal Joachim Meisner presided on the pope's behalf. Her feast is set for 19 June - the date of her solemn profession - rather than the date of her death.


== Life ==
Margaretha Flesch was born in 1826 in the German Confederation to Johann Georg Flesch. Her mother died in 1832 and her father re-married not long after this. She also had seven siblings after her (thus was the oldest) and had three half-siblings from her father's second marriage; one sibling was Maria Anna while one stepbrother was Giles. The death of her mother saw them move elsewhere to Niederbreitbach as a chance to improve their economic fortunes. The death of her father in 1842 forced her to work hard in order to provide for her stepmother and her siblings. It was around that time she self-taught herself nursing.
In the autumn of 1851 she moved in with her sister Maria Anna. Between 1852 until 1863 she worked in sewing in different schools but also worked as a nurse at the homes of clients and worked with orphans. In 1850 she met the pastor Jakob Gomm and had her first contacts with the Franciscans around this time. Her devotion to Saint Francis of Assisi was quite strong since her childhood. In 1862 she first met James Wirth and soon after built an orphanage and a hospital. Flesch also attempted to establish her own group of Franciscans - Gomm was hesitant and rejected this.
Flesch's half-brother Giles assisted her in establishing a simple residence that had connected to it a small hospital. Their first home was constructed in the spring of 1861 and Flesch and her sister moved into it on 11 November 1861. Flesch established her own Franciscan-branched order on 13 March 1863 and on 19 June 1863 she made her solemn profession into her own order and assumed the religious name of ""Maria Rosa"". The approval of the order's statutes on 21 October 1869 saw her elected as the first Mother Superior and she kept her office until 1878 in which she did not want to run for re-election. At the time she stepped down there were 100 sisters in a total of 21 branches.
Flesch died on 25 March 1906. Her order received the decree of praise of Pope Pius X on 12 December 1912 - after her death - and later received the full papal approval of Pope Pius XI on 30 April 1928. As of 2005 there were 392 religious in 39 houses operating in places such as Brazil and the Netherlands.


== Beatification ==
The beatification process commenced in Trier on 18 March 1957 - under Pope Pius XII - and witnessed an intensive diocesan process tasked with compiling information regarding her life and her work as a professed religious. The commencement of this process also accorded her the title of Servant of God which marked the first stage of the process. The investigation concluded in 1972.
The decree on her writings was approved on 21 November 1980 and was placed under the care of theologians so that the latter could investigate her written works in order to ensure that each of them adhered to Church doctrine and did not contradict or oppose it. Following this the diocesan process received ratification from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1999; this meant that Roman officials could begin their own investigations. It also allowed for those overseeing the process to compile and submit the Positio to Rome not long after - still in 1999 - to further the cause.
The Rome-based theologians approved the cause on 19 April 2005 while the C.C.S. followed this and also approved it on 6 December 2005. This allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to proclaim Flesch to be Venerable on 28 April 2006 upon recognizing her life heroic virtue.
The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated from 1998 until 1999 in Trier and involved the healing of Monica Schneider in the evenings of 5 and 6 September 1986. The C.C.S. approved the process of completing its work in 2001 and took possession of the boxes of documents for their own evaluation. It did not receive the approval of the pontiff until 2007. Cardinal Joachim Meisner presided over the beatification on 4 May 2008 on the behalf of Benedict XVI.
The current postulator assigned to the cause is the Franciscan Giovangiuseppe Califano.

158,"The Swedish National Heritage Board (Swedish: Riksantikvarieämbetet; RAÄ) is a Swedish government agency responsible for World Heritage Sites and other national heritage monuments and historical environments. It is governed by the Ministry of Culture.
The goals of the agency are to encourage the preservation and protection of historic environments and to promote the respect for and knowledge of historic environments. In order to do this, it tries to ensure that Swedish heritage is accessible to all citizens, to spread information about that heritage, and to ""empower heritage as a force in the evolution of a democratic, sustainable society"".


== History ==


=== 17th and 18th century ===
The National Heritage Board was founded in 1630. On the 20 May that year, Johannes Bureus who was a prominent rune researcher and King Gustavus Adolphus' private teacher, was appointed the first riksantikvarien (""National Antiquarian""). Bureus' teachings had made the king interested in ancient monuments and national heritage sites and artifacts, at that time called ""antiquities"". Together with a priest and a young student, Bureus went on a journey though Sweden to draw and document runestones, collect old coins, chronicles, law books, letter and manuscripts.
In 1666, Johan Hadorph the seventh National Antiquarian, established the Placat och Påbudh, Om Gamble Monumenter och Antiquiteter (""Signs and Decrees, of Old Monuments and Antiquities""), Sweden's first draft for an Antiquities Act. Aside from laws of the Vatican City, it was the first antiquities regulation in Europe. The decree made it possible to protect ancient monuments and sites from treasure hunters and vandalism, such as people who wanted to use ancient tumuli as brick kilns.
Public interest in ancient monuments and their protection subsided after the time of the Swedish Empire in the 1720s. In 1780, most of the museum collections owned by the government were handed over to the National Library and the National Archives. In 1768, the remainder of the objects were placed in the care of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, with the National Antiquarian as the academy's secretary.


=== 19th and the early 20th century ===

During the 18th century, there was a new interest in natural science as well as Neoclassicism and the study of ""antiquities"" was looked upon as somewhat dated. Some renewal of the studies was brought about when Johan Gustaf Liljegren became National Antiquarian in 1826. Among the projects he started was an organized inventory of objects and sites and archaeological excavations were done at Birka and Visby. A new antiquities regulation was also created in 1867. It stated that any violation of an ancient monument was a criminal offence.
While the Heritage Board's collection of historical objects was still in Stockholm, several additional positions within the area of heritage preservation were instituted during the 20th century. Sigurd Curman (NA from 1923) created a central head agency with a number of County Antiquarians to head all the county museums in Sweden. The County Antiquarians also coordinated their work with the National Heritage Board, which function as an independent government agency since 1938.


=== Second half of the 20th century ===
Part of the museum collections are today under the Statens historiska museer (SHMM) (""National Historical Museums""), the history of which is closely linked with that of the National Heritage Board.
The Antikvarisk-topografiska arkivet (ATA) (""Antiquarian Topographic Archive"") and the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities' Library are also part of the National Heritage Board. These departments are housed in the Eastern Stable opposite the main office building in Stockholm. The functions of the Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities and the National Heritage Board were separated in 1975 while they were still under the aegis under the newly formed government agency the ""National Heritage Board and National Historical Museums"". These were separated into two agencies, the National Heritage Board and the National Historical Museums, in 1998.


=== 21st century ===

On 2 June 2005, the government decided to relocate a major part of the National Heritage Board's activeties from Stockholm to Gotland. The move was made to compensate for the loss of jobs on the island when the Swedish military closed down all permanent garrisons there. The National Heritage Board moved to the newly built facilities at the old A7 military compound in Visby, in 2008. Since 2007, the facilities also housed the Swedish Exhibition Agency.
The move to Gotland was questioned by several officials within the agency who believed that the government did not understand how the National Heritage Board worked. Large parts of the operation are as of 2016 still remaining in Stockholm. Since 2012, this includes the main office in the Mounted Royal Guard's old caserns at the History Museum in Östermalm. Under the open area between the museum's main building and the Eastern Stable are storage rooms where the archive and library collections are kept.

Since 2015, the agency has operations in Stockholm, Visby and Tumba (Swedish Museum Services). It also has functions at the Old Uppsala Museum and Glimmingehus.


== Earlier functions ==
The agency was previously tasked with archaeological commission operations. This was Sweden's largest archaeological operations organization with several regional offices, among those in Stockholm, Linköping, Gothenburg and Lund. On 1 January 2015, the archaeological operations were transferred to the National Historical Museums. The National Heritage Board's previous double functions - as government agency and outsourcer - had been questioned as early as in the 1980s.
The National Heritage Board's Gotland Studies (Riksantikvarieämbetets Gotlandsundersökningar) (RAGU), were previously a regional office under the archaeological commission operations during the 1970s to 1980s. Since 2015, this is under the aegis of the Gotland Museum.


== Internet activities ==


=== Platsr ===
The agency run the Internet network Platsr, a site where individuals and organizations can write texts about events and memories connected to local history. Pictures, short films and locations on a map can be added to the texts. All material on Platsr is published under different versions of Creative Commons licenses. In March 2016, stories from approximately 3,300 locations had been written by a little more than 1,800 individuals, heritage societies, archives, museums and libraries.
Platsr was created in 2009, at the request of the Swedish government. The idea was to promote a more democratic historiography and to participate in this online.


=== Social media and Wikipedia ===
The National Heritage Board also use social media for its operation. The agency has a Facebook account and since 2009, it has used Flickr to publish archived material. In 2012, the agency started a collaboration with Wikipedia. Experienced Wikikpedia editors already worked for the agency in both Stockholm and Visby, and the goal of the collaboration was partly to improve the encyclopedia and partly to link Wikipedia to content in the agency's internal databases.


=== Fornsök ===
The agency also has an internet site called Fornsök, for searching its archives on archaeological and historical sites and buildings.


== National Antiquarians ==

The highest executive director at the National Heritage Board holds the title riksantikvarie (""National Antiquarian""). The title corresponds with Director-general in other government agencies. The office was instituted on 20 May 1630 by King Gustavus Adolphus. Since then, 31 persons have held the position.

159,"Films generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.
Traditionally, war films, musicals and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers in the 21st century. Seven Harry Potter films and five films from Peter Jackson's Middle-earth series are included in the nominal earnings chart, while the Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises feature prominently. There is also continued interest in the superhero genre: Batman and Superman from DC Comics and films based on the Marvel Comics brand, such as Spider-Man, X-Men and films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have generally done well. The only films in the top ten that are not adapted from a pre-existing property or a sequel are the top two, Avatar and Titanic, both directed by James Cameron. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen (the highest-grossing animated film), Zootopia and The Lion King, as well as with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story and Finding Nemo films have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.
While inflation has eroded away the achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.


== Highest-grossing films ==

With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.7 billion, Avatar is often proclaimed to be the ""highest-grossing"" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.
When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this pales in comparison to the $6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.
On this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Thirty-one films in total have grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide, of which three have grossed over $2 billion, with Avatar ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.


== Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation ==

Because of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.
Another complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change and the growth of international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.
The measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a ""top film of all time"", so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.
Despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Wind's adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Wind's nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.


== High-grossing films by year ==

Audience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.

Steven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) are in second and third place with five and four films respectively, while D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and James Cameron (1991, 1997 and 2009) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only five directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003) and Verbinski (2006 and 2007).
Because of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.


== Timeline of highest-grossing films ==

At least ten films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron—the current holder—twice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.
Some sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although it would have been the highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to Gone with the Wind's $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.

Another film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.
The Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all increased their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avatar—as the current record-holder—includes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run) along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.


== Highest-grossing franchises and film series ==

Prior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1 billion at the box office: James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Batman, Jurassic Park and Star Trek. Since the turn of the century that number has increased to over fifty (not including one-off hits such as Avatar, Titanic and Frozen). This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but also to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition, such as being based on a well known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as ""pre-sold"" films within the industry.
The films in the cross-franchise Marvel Cinematic Universe have collectively grossed the most, amassing over $13 billion at the box office, although the Eon James Bond films have earned over $14 billion in total when adjusted to current prices. The Harry Potter films are the highest-grossing series based on a single property, earning nearly $8 billion at the box office; Harry Potter has also generated at least $3.5 billion in home video revenue, taking total consumer spending on the films to over $11 billion. If ancillary income from merchandise is included, then Star Wars is the most lucrative property; it holds the Guinness world record for the ""most successful film merchandising franchise"" and was valued at £19.51 billion in 2012 (approximately $30 billion). With four billion-dollar grossers, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the only series where more than three films have grossed in excess of $1 billion (Star Wars is the only franchise with three such films), and the two Avengers films comprise the only franchise where each installment has grossed over $1 billion. Avengers is also the only franchise to have a series average of over $1 billion per film, although the Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic Park and Finding Nemo franchises, Harry Potter films, and Peter Jackson's Middle-earth adaptation also average over $1 billion adjusted for inflation.

161,"Mark Worth is an American whistleblower advocate, investigative journalist, public interest activist, author and publisher. He is the founder of many organizations, publications, campaigns and initiatives.
Worth is one of the world's top experts on whistleblower protection policy and practice. He advises and supports whistleblowers, investigates whistleblower disclosures, has written numerous studies and reports on whistleblower protection, and frequently speaks at international and regional forums, including the UN, European Parliament, APEC, Council of Europe, OECD and the International Anti-Corruption Conference.
He is a member of the UNODC Expert Group on Whistleblowing and has served as a consultant and researcher for many organizations, including the UN, European Commission, OECD and APEC. He has advised many governments in developing whistleblower laws, including in Albania, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Moldova, Nigeria, Serbia, Sweden, Taiwan, Tunisia and Ukraine.
Worth holds leadership positions in several whistleblower organizations. He is the founding director of the International Whistleblower Project at Blueprint for Free Speech. He is the co-founder and co-coordinator of the Southeast Europe Coalition on Whistleblower Protection, the first regional organization dedicated to strengthening whistleblower rights. He is a board member of the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF) and the founding coordinator of Transparency International's Whistleblower Program. He wrote the first studies on whistleblower policies in the EU and Southeast Europe, and co-wrote the first study on G20 countries.
Worth has worked for many international and national advocacy organizations including Public Citizen, Transparency International and Food & Water Europe, and many media companies including the New York Times and McClatchy. He is the co-founder of two independent newsmagazines, and has been an editor, staff writer and columnist at many publications.
He is the co-recipient of the 1994 Investigative Reporters and Editors award for magazine writing for an investigation of chemically injured workers at Boeing factories published in the Washington Free Press, which he co-founded in 1992.
Worth is the author of Zapped: Irradiation and the Death of Food, the first general-interest book on the controversial technology of food irradiation. While at Public Citizen in the early 2000s, Worth co-founded a successful campaign to block the approval of irradiated foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The campaign led to the pulling of irradiated foods from stores throughout the U.S. and the bankruptcy of the leading irradiation company, SureBeam.
He initiated the international campaign to pressure the Karl May Museum in Radebeul, Germany, to repatriate Native American scalps to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and other tribes. The controversy has been reported in many international and German media outlets.


== Strengthening whistleblower rights and protections ==
Worth has led or participated in numerous campaigns to strengthen whistleblower rights and protections worldwide, including in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Moldova, Serbia, Ukraine, the UK and across Europe.
He is the founding director of the International Whistleblower Project at Blueprint for Free Speech, the co-founder and co-coordinator of the Southeast Europe Coalition on Whistleblower Protection, and the founding coordinator of Transparency International's International Whistleblower Program.
Worth has written or co-written many studies on whistleblower protection policies, initiatives and cases. These include:
""Protecting Whistleblowers in the UK: A New Blueprint"" (2016)
“Breaking the Silence: Strengths & Weaknesses in G20 Whistleblower Protection Laws"" (2015)
“Whistleblower Protection in Southeast Europe: An Overview of Laws, Practice, and Recent Initiatives” (2015)
“Whistleblower Protection in the Swiss Private Sector” (2015)
“Whistleblowing in Europe: Legal Protections for Whistleblowers in the EU” (2013)
“International Principles for Whistleblower Legislation” (2013)


== Transparency International ==
Worth was the Whistleblower Programme Coordinator for Transparency International from 2012-13. In 2013 he wrote a report on whistleblower protection laws and practices in the European Union, ""Whistleblowing in Europe"" and ""International Principles for Whistleblower Legislation"", and organised and spoke at the international conference ""Whistleblowing for Change"".
Worth's Voices for Change video features prominent whistleblowers Wendy Addison (South Africa), Thomas Drake (US), James Shelton (Australia) and Guido Strack (Germany).
Among other venues, he has spoken at the Heinrich Boll Foundation, the European University Institute and the University of Amsterdam.


== Washington Free Press ==
Worth's 1994 investigation of Boeing, co-authored by Eric Nelson with additional research by Andrea Helm, was published in the Washington Free Press. (Worth co-founded the Free Press in Seattle in 1992 with Alex Mayer and Amy Tullis.) The package of articles, entitled ""It's All In Your Head,"" describes how ""Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Boeing workers say they've been sickened by the chemicals used at Boeing plants throughout Puget Sound. But instead of giving these workers the medical and financial help they need, Boeing -- with the help of its connections within state government and the medical establishment -- is saying many workers just have psychological problems."" Worth and Nelson received the 1994 Investigative Reporters and Editors award for magazine writing.
The Free Press found that Boeing told workers—mostly women—to use chemicals and materials that that company knew was toxic and caused health problems, did not provide workers adequate safety equipment, denied workers' compensation benefits, and hired doctors who contended that the workers' health problems were actually psychologically based. The investigation also found evidence of collusion between Boeing and the Washington state government agency that oversees the workers' compensation program.
One sickened Boeing worker, Claudia ""Dea"" Sartain, committed suicide after her worker's compensation benefits were terminated by the state of Washington upon Boeing's urging. In her suicide note, obtained by the Free Press, Sartain described the working conditions at Boeing's parts fabrication plant in Auburn, Washington: working while hanging upside-down (""We would stay in these positions sometimes for days ...""), working with carcinogenic adhesives (""Women were having miscarriages all the time ...""), and arguing with her boss about handling toxic chemicals (""All you're worried about is this material. How much is my life worth?""). Shortly after New Year's Day of 1990, Sartain stole her brother's gun, drove to a friend's house, and shot herself in the front yard. Sartain was 32.


== Public Citizen ==
As a Research Director at Public Citizen, Worth was involved with a campaign in the early 2000s to expose the risks of food irradiation and to prevent US and international agencies from approving and promoting the technology. The campaign blocked the approval of irradiated foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, led to irradiated foods being pulled from stores and restaurants throughout the U.S., helped push the leading irradiation company, SureBeam, into bankruptcy, and prevented irradiated foods from being misleadingly labeled ""pasteurized.""
Worth authored several reports that documented failures by the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization to adequately screen the safety of irradiated foods before approving or recommending them for public consumption. These reports include:
A Broken Record: How the FDA Legalized – and Continues to Legalize – Food Irradiation Without Testing It for Safety (co-authored by Samuel Epstein's Cancer Prevention Coalition)
Bad Taste: The Disturbing Truth of the World Health Organization's Endorsement of Food Irradiation, and
Hidden Harm: How the FDA is Ignoring the Potential Dangers of Unique Chemicals in Irradiated Food (co-authored by Peter Jenkins of the Center for Food Safety).
Worth also co-authored the first book about food irradiation written for the general public, Zapped: Irradiation and the Death of Food (with Wenonah Hauter of Food & Water Watch).
While at Public Citizen, Worth arranged for the first English translation of a German study revealing that a chemical formed in irradiated food can cause genetic mutations. The chemical, known as 2-DCB, was found to cause ""significant DNA damage"" in the colons of rats that ate the substance. The chemical has never been found naturally in any food on Earth.


== ""Who Really Runs Seattle"" ==
In 1998 Worth wrote ""Who Really Runs Seattle"": A Who's Who of the City's Backroom Wheeler-Dealers -- ""an extensive review of people affiliated with Seattle's biggest corporations, most influential lobbying groups, largest nonprofits, highest-stakes political campaigns, and most visible government agencies [that] reveals the existence of ... a well-connected network of people in the city whose names keep coming up again and again."" The exposé was published in the Seattle Weekly.


== Investigative journalism ==
Worth's articles, written for various publications, have exposed:
a dubious whistleblower program set up by German-based engineering multinational Siemens.
a network of powerful political and business interests in Seattle,
environmental harm caused by Boeing,
the funneling of low-income housing funds to an upscale shopping mall in Seattle,
political meddling by a water conglomerate in California,
misconduct by a small-town mayor in Florida.


== Repatriation of Native American remains ==
In 2011 Worth began an international campaign to pressure the Karl May Museum in Radebeul, Germany, to repatriate Native American scalps to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and other Tribes. ""It is fitting that the Karl May Museum - whose limited knowledge and false impressions of Native Americans have their foundation in fictional characters invented by someone who had spent limited time with Native Americans - is now claiming to know the best resting place for remains of Native Americans,"" he said. The controversy has been reported in many media outlets, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Spiegel, The Independent, and Deutsche Welle.
Worth spoke at a public event about the controversy at the annual Karl May Festival in Radebeul on May 31, 2014. Worth joined Cecil Pavlat of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation, Radebeul Mayor Bert Wendsche, and Karl May Museum director Claudia Kaulfuss (see 1:46 of video).

162,"The ADK class were a class of diesel multiple units that were last operated by Transdev Auckland on Auckland's suburban rail network. Originally built by Commonwealth Engineering and the Midland Railway Workshops for the Western Australian Government Railways in the late 1960s, all but one were sold in 1993 to New Zealand Rail, and are currently owned by Auckland Transport. The units were completely withdrawn from service on 8 December 2014, following completion of electrification of Auckland's network.


== History ==
In 1967 and 1968 ten two-carriage stainless steel sets were manufactured for the Western Australian Government Railways. Each set consisted of an ADK power car manufactured by Commonwealth Engineering, and an ADB trailer built by the WAGR's Midland Railway Workshops. The ADK cars were manufactured in Granville and railed via Melbourne and Adelaide requiring a change of bogies at each of these locations and again at Kalgoorlie.
Following the electrification of the Perth rail network they were rendered surplus and in 1993 all except ADK 689 were sold, along with the newer ADL/ADC class, to New Zealand Rail to replace 56-foot carriages on suburban trains in Auckland. In October 1993, prior to being privatised, New Zealand Rail sold the class to the Auckland Regional Council.
In 2004 the ARC funded an upgrade, which included refurbishment of the interiors, painting in the new MAXX blue colour scheme and mechanical improvements to extend their life by 10 years. After the upgrade they ran as four-car rather than two-car sets. All were refurbished except ADB 773 (in use at Lock 'n' Load paintball arena) and ADK 689 (which did not move to New Zealand). Westrail planned on converting ADK 689 to a self-propelled track inspection carriage, however this did not eventuate.
Unlike the ADL/ADC class and SA sets, the units have not been fitted with Electronic Train Protection (ETP) equipment, owing to their imminent replacement by the AM class. All are scheduled for withdrawal by late 2014.
As of 15 September 2014, all services on the Manukau Line are operated by the AM class. As a result of this, all ADK units were placed into warm storage. Services to Papakura formerly run by ADKs are now run by ADLs, also displaced from the Manukau Line. A farewell trip was run by the Railway Enthusiasts Society on 16 November 2014, running on every suburban line in Auckland. The units were completely withdrawn on 20 July 2015. In August 2017 eight units were shipped to Mozambique, with one unit being purchased by the New Zealand Special Air Services.

As of January 2009, the following brands have participated: 3M, AT&T, Blackberry, CDW, Dell, Dr. Pepper, STA Travel, Discover Card, Ford, GEICO, General Mills, ice.com, Idearc, Kraft, Monster, My Rich Uncle, P & G, Palm, RealNetworks, Saturn, Sears, STA Travel, NBA, Unilever, Vault.com, Volvo, Warner Bros, Western Union, Wrigley, and Yahoo.
The notebooks are designed to reflect the brand of the school distributing by adopting their colors and logo. The first eight pages include college-specific information such as campus maps, important telephone numbers, and academic calendars.


== Beginnings ==
ABS was founded in 2006 by two students studying at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Their goal was to channel brand marketing dollars to products that benefit students and enhance the college learning experience.


== Notebook Distribution ==

173,"Hutchinson is the largest city and county seat in Reno County, Kansas, United States, and located on the Arkansas River. It has been home to salt mines since 1887, thus its nickname of ""Salt City"", but locals call it ""Hutch"". As of the 2010 census, the city population was 42,080.
Each year, Hutchinson hosts the Kansas State Fair, and National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Basketball Tournament. It is the home of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center aerospace museum and Strataca (formerly known as Kansas Underground Salt Museum).


== History ==

The city of Hutchinson was founded in 1871, when Indian Agent Clinton ""C.C."" Hutchinson contracted with the Santa Fe Railway to make a town at the railroad's crossing over the Arkansas River. The community earned the nickname ""Temperance City"" due to the prohibition of alcohol set by its founder. Hutchinson was incorporated as a city in August, 1872.
In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Hutchinson to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the ""Rock Island"".
In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were used in Kansas and other Midwest states as a means of solving the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large prisoner-of-war camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Hutchinson.
On January 17, 2001, 143 million cubic feet (4,000,000 m3) of compressed natural gas leaked from the nearby Yaggy storage field. It sank underground, then rose to the surface through old brine, or salt wells making around 15 gas blowholes. An explosion in the downtown area at 10:45 a.m. destroyed 2 businesses and damaged 26 others. An explosion the next day in a mobile-home park took the lives of two people. The Kansas National Guard was called in to help evacuate parts of the city because of the gas leaks, and a team of specialists looked over all the city for leaks after the event. These events were broadcast on nationally televised news stations across the country.


== Geography ==

== Economy ==
Salt was discovered in Reno County by Benjamin Blanchard on September 26, 1887. This gave rise to the first salt-processing plants west of the Mississippi River. Salt was originally extracted using the evaporation method by pumping water into brine wells. In 1923, the Carey Salt Company opened the only salt mine in Hutchinson, which then produced rock salt. That mine is still in use today and is now operated by Hutchinson Salt Company. Cargill and Morton Salt also have evaporative salt plants in Hutchinson.
Excavated portions of the mine are used for archival storage of movie and television masters, data tapes, and permanent business records. Underground Vaults & Storage currently houses the masters for The Wizard of Oz (1939), Gone with the Wind (1939), and Star Wars, (1977) among many others.

179,"In music, a glissando [ɡlisˈsando] (plural: glissandi, abbreviated gliss.) is a glide from one pitch to another ( Play ). It is an Italianized musical term derived from the French glisser, to glide. In some contexts it is distinguished from the continuous portamento. Some colloquial equivalents are slide, sweep (referring to the 'discrete glissando' effects on guitar & harp respectively), bend, smear, rip (for a loud, violent gliss to the beginning of a note), lip (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one's embouchure on a wind instrument), plop, or falling hail (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails).


== Glissando vs. portamento ==
Prescriptive attempts to distinguish the glissando from the portamento by limiting the former to the filling in of discrete intermediate pitches on instruments like the piano, harp, and fretted stringed instruments have run up against established usage of instruments like the trombone and timpani. The latter could thus be thought of as capable of either 'glissando' or 'portamento', depending on whether the drum was rolled or not. The clarinet gesture that opens Rhapsody in Blue could likewise be thought of either way: it was originally planned as a glissando (Gershwin's score labels each individual note) but is in practice played as a portamento though described as a glissando.


== 'Discrete glissando' ==
On some instruments (e.g., piano, harp, xylophone), discrete tones are clearly audible when sliding. For example, on a keyboard, a player's fingertips can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys, producing either a C major scale or an F♯ major pentatonic (or their relative modes); or, by performing both at once, it is possible to produce a full chromatic scale, but this is difficult. On a harp, the player can slide their finger across the strings, quickly playing the scale (or on pedal harp even arpeggios such as C♭-D-E♯-F-G♯-A♭-B). Wind, brass, and fretted-stringed-instrument players can perform an extremely rapid chromatic scale (e.g., sliding up or down a string quickly on a fretted instrument).
Maurice Ravel's piece Alborada del Gracioso contains notable piano glissando passages in thirds executed by the right hand.
Arpeggio effects (likewise named glissando) are also obtained by bowed strings (playing harmonics) and brass, especially the horn.


== 'Continuous glissando' or portamento ==

Musical instruments with continuously variable pitch can effect a portamento over a substantial range. These include unfretted stringed instruments (such as the violin, viola, cello and double bass, and fretless guitars), stringed instruments with a way of stretching the strings (such as the guitar, veena, or sitar), a fretted guitar or lap steel guitar when accompanied with the use of a slide, wind instruments without valves or stops (such as the trombone or slide whistle), timpani (kettledrums), electronic instruments (such as the theremin, the ondes Martenot, synthesizers and keytars), the water organ, and the human voice.
Brass and woodwind instruments such as the trumpet or flute can effect a similar limited slide by altering the lip pressure (trumpet) or a combination of embouchure and rolling the head joint (flute), while the clarinet and some models of flute can achieve this by slowly dragging fingers off tone holes or changing the oral cavity's resonance by manipulating tongue position, embouchure, and throat shaping.
Many electric guitars are fitted with a tremolo arm which can produce either a portamento, a vibrato, or a combination of both (but not a true tremolo despite the name). Tremolo is a repeated variation of loudness while holding pitch constant; vibrato is a repeated variation of pitch (frequency).


== Bent note ==
A bent note is a musical note that is varied in pitch. With unfretted strings or other continuous-pitch instruments such as the trombone, or with the human voice, such variation is more properly described in terms of intonation. Bent notes are commonly played on fretted instruments, literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure, or on free reed instruments such as the harmonica, by using excess air pressure to overblow the reed. On brass instruments such as the trumpet, the note is bent by using the lip. ""Indeterminately pitched instruments [such as unpitched percussion instruments and friction drum rolls]...produce a pitch or pitch spectrum that becomes higher with an increase of dynamic and lower with a decrease of dynamic.""
The bent note is commonly found in various forms of jazz and blues.

194,"Skënder Muço (1904–1944) was an Albanian lawyer and leader of Balli Kombëtar, one of the most important resistance organizations in Albania during World War II. Along with Musine Kokalari Muço founded the first social democratic party of Albania in 1943. In 1944 he was ambushed by German troops near Vlorë and executed three days later.


== Early life ==
Skënder Muço was born in Tragjas, Ottoman Empire, in 1904. His father, Daut, was an activist of the Albanian National Awakening, while his uncle, Alem Tragjasi, had fought in the Vlora War. Muço initially studied in San Demetrio Corone, Calabria, and later graduated from the faculty of law of the University of Bologna. In 1932 he was arrested and sentenced to death because of his participation in the nationalist and anti-monarchist organization Lëvizja e Vlorës (English: Vlora Movement), but his sentence was eventually reduced after public pressure on the government. When Albania was occupied by Italy he took part in the protests of Vlorë on April 7, 1939.


== World War II ==
During World War II Skënder Muço joined the ranks of Balli Kombëtar, one of the most important resistance organizations in Albania. At the end of November 1942, along with Hysni Lepenica, a former gendarmerie officer from Gjirokastër, he founded the first battalion of Balli Kombëtar in Vlorë named Shqiponja (English: Eagle). Muço also became head of Balli Kombëtar in the Vlorë region and a member of the organization's council. As commanders of Shqiponja Muço and Lepenica confronted many times the Italian and later Germans troops. One of the most important of those battles was the battle of Gjorm, in which Balli Kombëtar inflicted heavy losses on the Italian army.
In 1943 he was one of the representatives of Balli Kombëtar in the Mukje Agreement, a treaty of collaboration signed by Balli Kombëtar and the National Liberation Movement. Along with Musine Kokalari Muço founded the first social democratic party of Albania in 1943-4 as a faction of Balli Kombëtar. On 21 November 1943 he wrote and published a pamphlet labeling the German troops and their Albanian collaborators as the barbaric enemy. On 7 August 1944 he was ambushed and captured by German troops while going to Vlorë with two other Ballists, Yzeir Ismaili and Zako Mezi. He was executed three days later in Bubullimë, Lushnjë, western Albania.

196,"Stavros Spyros Niarchos (Greek: Σταύρος Σπύρος Νιάρχος, pronounced [ˈstavros ˈspiros 'ɲarxos]; 3 July 1909 – 16 April 1996) was a multi-billionaire Greek shipping tycoon. Starting in 1952, he had the world's biggest supertankers built for his fleet. Propelled by both the Suez Crisis and an increasing demand for oil, he and rival Aristotle Onassis became giants in global petroleum shipping.
Niarchos was also a noted thoroughbred horse breeder and racer, several times the leading owner and number one on the French breed list.


== Early life ==
Stavros was born in Athens to a wealthy family, son of Spyros Niarchos and his wife, Eugenie Koumantaros, a rich heiress. His great great grand father, Philippos Niarchos, a Greek shipping agent in Valletta, had married a daughter from a noble family in Malta, whose younger offspring had moved to Greece to base themselves in a merchant business from Malta.
His parents were naturalized Americans who had owned a department store in Buffalo, New York before returning to Greece, three months prior to his birth. He studied in the city's best private school before starting university. He studied law at the University of Athens, after which he went to work for his maternal uncles in the Koumantaros family's grain business. During this period, he became involved in shipping by convincing his uncles their firm would be more profitable if it owned its own ships.


== Shipping career ==
Niarchos was a naval officer in World War II, during which time part of the trade fleet he had developed with his uncle was destroyed. He used about two million dollars in insurance settlement to build a new fleet. His most famous asset was the yacht Atlantis, currently known as Issham Al Baher after having been gifted to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
He then founded Niarchos Ltd., an international shipping company that at one time operated more than 80 tankers worldwide. He and Aristotle Onassis were great shipping rivals. In 1952 high capacity oil supertankers were built for the competing Niarchos and Onassis fleets who were, at the time, both claiming to own the largest tanker in the world. In 1955 Vickers Armstrongs Shipbuilders Ltd launched the 30,708 GRT SS Spyros Niarchos. Then the world's largest supertanker, it was named after Niarchos' second son, Spyros, born earlier that year.
In 1956 the Suez Canal Crisis considerably increased the demand for the type of large tonnage ships that Niarchos owned. Business flourished and he became a billionaire.


== Personal life ==


=== Marriages ===
Niarchos was married five times:
To Helen Sporides in 1930, a daughter of Admiral Constantine Sporides, lasted one year.
To Melpomene Capparis in 1939, a widow of a Greek diplomat, whom he divorced in 1947.
To Eugenia Livanos in 1947, a daughter of shipping magnate Stavros G. Livanos. They divorced in 1965; she died in 1970 at the age of 44, after an overdose of barbiturates.
During this marriage he had an affair with Pamela Churchill (later Pamela Harriman).

To Charlotte Ford in 1966, daughter of tycoon automaker Henry Ford II, in Mexico. Their daughter Elena Anne Ford was born six months later. When the marriage ended in divorce the following year Niarchos returned to his former wife, Eugenia. No remarriage was necessary, since the couple's 1965 Mexican divorce had not been recognized by Greek law.
To Athina Spencer-Churchill, his third wife Eugenia's sister, in 1971. Then the Marchioness of Blandford, Athina had been the first wife of Aristotle Onassis. She died of an overdose in 1974.
From the late 1970s until his death, he was linked to Princess Firyal of Jordan. He was also said to be linked to Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy.


=== Children ===
Niarchos had two daughters and three sons:
By his third wife, Eugenia Livanos, whom he never divorced under Greek law:
Maria Isabella Niarchos, a breeder of thoroughbreds. Married to Stephane Gouazé. Mother of two children: Artur Gouazé and Maia Gouazé
Philippos, also known as Philippe Niarchos, art collector. Married in 1984 to his third wife Victoria Guinness (b. 1960), who is the younger daughter of Patrick Benjamin Guinness and Baroness Dolores von Fürstenberg-Hedringen. They had four children together: Stavros Niarchos Jr. (b. 1985), Eugenie Niarchos (b. 1986), Theodorakis Niarchos (b. 1991), Electra Niarchos (b. 1995).
Spyros (b. 1955) married 1987 (divorced 1999) the Hon. Daphne Guinness (b. 1967), daughter of Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne by his second wife Suzanne Lisney, and had issue three children: Nicolas Stavros Niarchos (b. 1989), Alexis Spyros Niarchos (b. 1991) and Ines Niarchos (b. 1995). Spyros is a good friend of Prince Ernst August of Hanover, and was best man at his wedding to Princess Caroline of Monaco.
Konstantin, or Constantine Niarchos (1962–1999); married firstly 1987 (divorced) Princess Alessandra Borghese, no issue; married secondly the Brazilian artist Sylvia Martins, no issue. He was the first Greek to scale Mt. Everest. At his death of a massive cocaine overdose in 1999, The Independent (UK) reported he had been left one billion dollars as his share of his late father's estate.

By his fourth wife; Charlotte Ford:
Elena Ford (b. 1966) married firstly 1991 (divorced) to Stanley Jozef Olender, married secondly 1996 Joseph Daniel Rippolone (divorced), with issue.


=== Death ===
Niarchos died in 1996, in Zurich. He is buried in the family tomb in Lausanne. At his death his fortune was estimated to be worth in excess of $22 billion. When Niarchos died, he left half his fortune to a charitable trust to be established in his name and the other half to his three sons and daughter Maria by his marriage to Greek shipping heiress Eugenia Livanos, a nephew, and a great nephew. He notably excluded Elena Ford his daughter by his ex-wife Charlotte Ford from his will. Elena sued the estate in both Swiss and Greek courts for her 1/10th share estimated to be worth 700 million GBP sterling.


== Thoroughbred horse racing ==
Niarchos began investing in thoroughbred horse racing in the early 1950s and won his first stakes race with Pipe of Peace at the Middle Park Stakes. After leaving the business for roughly two decades he came back in the 1970s and eventually put together a highly successful stable of racehorses that competed in France and the United Kingdom. He acquired the Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard horse breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme, France and Oak Tree Farm in Lexington, Kentucky where in 1984 he bred his most successful horse, Miesque. Niarchos was the leading owner in France twice (1983, 1984) and topped the breeders' there list three times (1989, 1993, 1994). His prize horses were all trained by François Boutin, whose skill was a vital element of Niarchos' success in the field.
After his death in 1996, his daughter Maria Niarchos-Gouazé took charge of racing operations. She too was successful, her colt Bago winning France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, in 2004, and her filly Divine Proportions capturing the 2005 Prix de Diane by winning 9 out of her 10 races until a serious tendon injury cut the horse's racing career short.

198,"Door breaching is a process used by military, police, or emergency services to force open closed and/or locked doors. A wide range of methods are available, one or more of which may be used in any given situation.
Where no tools are available, it is usually possible to force open most inward-opening doors with a strong kick that breaks through the door frame. This can be a common method of entry for many trained police officers who are conducting warranted searches, and the ""macho"" concept of kicking in doors has frequently been glamorized on various police procedural shows. Kicking in a locked door is also sometimes attempted or performed by neighbors and ordinary passers-by who witness an emergency situation such as a house that is on fire (though the first step should always be to call Emergency Services) in order to ensure that everyone is out of the house or to notify/assist anyone who is not. Kicking in doors is less commonly used in burglary attempts since the process requires a great deal of energy and makes a lot of noise.
Regarding the use of specified tools for forcible entry, there are several other methods of door breaching. These methods may be divided up into mechanical breaching, ballistic breaching, explosive breaching, and thermal breaching.


== Mechanical breaching ==

Mechanical breaching can be minimally destructive, through the use of lock picks. This method is relatively slow and requires a trained operator, but does not damage the lock or door. Using specialized tools (i.e.: A-tool, K-tool), a lock cylinder can also be quickly dismantled and unlocked without removing it from the door; this method also allows the door to be closed and re-locked. Mechanical breaching also includes hydraulic breaching, which uses a special hydraulic ram to overcome the lock. The hydraulic ram may be powered manually, pneumatically, or electrically. More dynamic methods (kinetic breaching) use force to break the lock or door. The common methods are to use a lever, such as a Halligan bar or crowbar, or to use a tool to concentrate a large amount of force on the door, such as a sledgehammer, hydraulic jack, or battering ram.


== Ballistic breaching ==

Ballistic breaching uses a projectile weapon to breach an opening. Weapons used can range from small arms to the 120 mm cannon of a main battle tank with a HEAT round, which will breach most obstacles easily, though the force involved may violate the rules of engagement. A less damaging ballistic breach needs to destroy either the latch and lock, or the hinges of the door, and the ideal choice for this is the shotgun. While in theory other firearms can be used, handguns are usually underpowered and rifles are less effective than the shotgun and pose a far higher risk of ricochet and collateral injury. Most shotgun ammunition can be used for breaching, though the risk of injury varies with type. Of the available shotgun ammunition, shotgun slugs pose the highest risk, as they will retain significant energy to cause lethal wounds well after they have penetrated the door. Buckshot is far safer, and birdshot even safer, as the multiple small projectiles disperse quickly after penetration, reducing the chances of causing a lethal wound. The safest option is a frangible round such as the TESAR or Hatton round, which turns to dust upon penetrating the door, and disperses completely upon exit.
Breaching a door with the fewest number of shots possible both is faster and reduces the chance of collateral damage. Attacking the latch and lock is easiest, as it requires fewer shots and is easiest to target, whereas attacking the hinges requires more shots, and the hinges may be hidden from the outside. Careful aim is required; shots to the lock side are fired at a point halfway between the lock or handle and the door frame in order to hit the bolt holding the door shut. According to US urban warfare doctrine, the breaching operation is performed with the muzzle in contact with the door, or as close as possible, and angled downwards at a 45 degree angle. This process provides the best chance of hitting the desired point, while minimizing risk to occupants of the room being breached. Muzzle attachments are available on some specialized breaching shotguns to facilitate this operation, by holding the barrel securely in place while providing a slight standoff to allow powder gases to escape.
Magazine capacity and operating mechanism are also important considerations in a breaching shotgun, because to quickly breach a door requires the ability to quickly fire multiple shots. For a breach on the latch side, US doctrine calls for two shots to be fired, and then an attempt made to open the door. If the door cannot be opened, the process would need to be quickly repeated. If the hinges must be breached, then doctrine calls for a total of three shots, one per hinge followed by an attempt to open the door.


== Explosive breaching ==
Explosive breaching can be the fastest method, though it is also the most dangerous, to both the breachers and the room occupants. Depending on the situation, explosive breaching is potentially slower than a ballistic breach due to the large standoff required when using explosives, if there is no cover available. Breaching can be performed with a specially formed breaching charge placed in contact with the door, or with various standoff breaching devices, such as specialized rifle grenades like the SIMON breach grenade.
Breaching using explosives is primarily an operation performed by highly trained explosives experts. Explosive breaching charges can range from highly focused methods, such as detcord, plastic explosives, or strip shaped charges that explosively cut through doors or latches, to large satchel charges, containing 20 pounds (9 kg) of C-4, that can breach even reinforced concrete bunkers.


== Thermal breaching ==
Thermal breaching is one of the least common techniques and also one of the slowest. It involves the use of a cutting torch to cut through metal doors.

SoAFCU has around ten thousand members. Any person who lives, works, or worships within the Fairbanks North Star Borough is eligible to join the credit union.


== History ==
SoAFCU was originally a small credit union located in the Viking Room of Constitution Hall, University of Alaska Fairbanks. The credit union was started with $32 in a metal cash box and was first named ""Greater Fairbanks Teacher's Credit Union"". It was dedicated to non-profit operations for the service and benefit of its member teachers. As the membership grew and expanded to include members north of the Alaska Range, the name was changed in 1975 to ""Northern Schools Federal Credit Union."" The name was again changed in 2007 to ""Spirit of Alaska Federal Credit Union"" to reflect the continued expansion of the field of membership and expansive growth of SoAFCU.
SoAFCU opened their newest branch at the corner of Hunter and Johansen in north Fairbanks June 4, 2011.

201,"NGC 5775 is a spiral galaxy, a member of the Virgo Cluster, that lies at a distance of about 70 million light-years. Although the spiral is tilted away from us, with only a thin sliver in view, such a perspective can be advantageous for astronomers. For instance, astronomers have previously used the high inclination of this spiral to study the properties of the halo of hot gas that is visible when the galaxy is observed at X-ray wavelengths.


== Interaction with NGC 5774 ==
NGC 5775 is interacting with the nearby galaxy NGC 5774 in the form of two connecting H I bridges through which the gas is travelling from NGC 5774 to NGC 5775. Faint optical emission as well as radio continuum emission are also present along the bridges. It is possible that star formation is occurring between the galaxies.
This system may be in the early stages of a merger.

203,"Wayward Lad (1975-2003) was an English Thoroughbred racehorse who was one of the ""Dickinson five"". (Michael Dickinson trained all the horses which took the first five places at the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup). But there was far more than that to Wayward Lad's career, which ended in early 1987. By then he had won 28 of his 55 races on 16 different tracks and his final success, at the 1987 Grand National meeting, brought his career earnings to £218,732, at the time a sum beaten only by Dawn Run. His best wins came in the Whitbread Gold Label Cup Chase (now the Betfred Bowl) twice, the King George VI Chase, which he won for a third time in 1985, the Charlie Hall Chase and the Edward Hanmer Chase. A row between his owners resulted in him going to Doncaster sales, where Tony Dickinson (Michael's father) bought him for 42,000 Guineas and sent him to retirement with his son, who had begun a new career training in the USA.

204,"SREDIM is a method of task analysis, which stands for: words select, record, examine, develop, install/implement and maintain. This methods analysis system can be used to analyse any process to determine parts of the process which are inefficient, or can be improved.


== Select ==
Choose the parts of the process to study, identifying bottlenecks, and data to collect etc. The ""bottleneck"" is not necessarily just a pinch point in the work flow typically found in production processes. It can also be identified as any task or part of the process that falls below the anticipated or predetermined standard.
Therefore we must also consider, poor quality, imbalance in work content between processes (typical on textile production lines), lack of raw material supply, machine malfunction, lack of meaningful standard operating procedures or adequate training.
We need to consider all of the above in the ""selection"" process, i.e. something that is affecting the normal function of the system or task under review.


== Record ==
This part of the process is based around taking details of the different parts of the process which is to be studied, as defined in part 1.


== Examine ==
Analyse the data that you have collected and apply another acronym to it, PPSPM:


== Develop ==
When you have identified the problems and issues, this is the stage to create a new method or process based on data collected.


== Install or Implement ==
The new method which has been put together must be costed and installed for it to work


== Maintain ==
While it takes a lot of effort to create a new method, for it to continue working, processes must be put in place to ensure that the system continues working.

205,"Émerainville - Pontault-Combault is a French railway station on the Paris-Est - Mulhouse-Ville railway, located in Émerainville, Seine-et-Marne département, Ile-de-France region. It bears the name of Pontault-Combault commune as its territory reaches the south and the west of the building. It serves a district of Marne-la-Vallée.
The station is put into service on February 9, 1857, by the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est, when the section from Nogent - Le Perreux to Nangis opens. It is a SNCF station served by RER line E trains.


== Location ==
Émerainville - Pontault-Combault station, whose elevation is 109 meters (358 ft), is located at kilometric point 27.224 of the Paris–Mulhouse railway, between Les Yvris-Noisy-le-Grand and Roissy-en-Brie stations..


== History ==


=== Evolution of Émerainville station ===
The Est company puts in operation Émerainville station at the opening of the section from Nogent - Le Perreux to Nangis to commercial service. That section opens with only one track, the second is put into service on April 23, 1857.
In 2000, a contract between the state and the Ile-de-France region organizes the expansion of the RER E from Villiers-sur-Marne to Tournan. On February 14, 2002, the STIF board of directors approves of the pilot. On December 14, 2003, the line is cut from its historical network to Paris Est, and linked with RER E leading to Haussmann - Saint Lazare underground station. That integration modify journeys and timetables, and improves the station services. Platforms are raised from 0.55 meters (1.80 ft) to 0.92 meters (3.02 ft) to facilitate access to the carriages. Facilities improve accessibility to people with limited mobility. Screens on the platforms show real time information.


=== Branch to Menier factory in Noisiel ===
From 1883 to 1959, the station was the start of a private standard gauge railway serving Menier chocolate factory in Noisiel. It measured 10 km, including a 1.6 km section inside the factory. It included a branch serving La Ferme du Buisson cultural center. It was fully in the Menier family domain and included five railroad crossings.


=== Branch to Pariest industrial park ===
Menier branch was then refurbished with a marshalling yard in Émerainville and an extension to the west, with a unique track, along A4 autoroute and rounding Lognes - Émerainville aerodrome, then heading to Pariest industrial park in Lognes. That is a 7.5 km track serving Seita and SEVM companies, carrying 118000 tons of freight a year. The line is disused in 2005 as the two companies move and the line manager refuse to pay for the maintenance.


== Service ==


=== Facilities ===
As a Transilien network station, commercial services are available everyday, as well as facilities and assistance to people with limited mobility. The station is equipped with vending machines for Transilien and main lines tickets, and with real time traffic information system. Several facilities are present, such as a press booth and a vending machine proposing drinks and sweets.


=== Train service ===
The station is served in both directions by one train every 30 minutes off-peak and in the evening. It is served by two to four trains an hour during peak times.


=== Connections ===
Several car parks are set nearby.
The station is also served by bus companies:
SITUS lines 2 and 7
Seine-et-Marne Express line 18
RATP Group lines 206, 212 and 421
Sit'bus lines 504, 505 and 506

208,"Joseph Fessio  (born January 10, 1941) is an American Catholic priest of the Jesuit order and the founder and editor of Ignatius Press. He was the founding provost of Ave Maria University until March 2007.


== Education ==
Fessio attended high school at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California, from 1954 to 1958. He took afterwards undergraduate studies in civil engineering at the University of Santa Clara, California. He entered the Jesuit novitiate on September 7, 1961. Before his ordination to the priesthood, he earned a B.A (in 1966) and an M.A. (in 1967) in Philosophy from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. He also earned an M.A in Theology from his studies in Lyon, France. He was ordained a priest on June 10, 1972.
In 1975, he earned his doctorate in theology from the University of Regensburg, West Germany. His thesis director was Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope-emeritus Benedict XVI. The subject of his thesis was The Ecclesiology of Hans Urs von Balthasar.


== Ecclesiastical and professional career ==
From 1966 - 1974 Fessio taught philosophy and theology at Gonzaga University and at the University of Santa Clara and University of San Francisco in California. He was the co-founder Director of Project 50. In 1976 he founded the St. Ignatius Institute at the University of San Francisco, and in 1978 he founded and became the first editor of Ignatius Press. In the following year he became the director of Religious Books on Tape, the audio division of Ignatius Press, until 1987 when he was fired from his position as Director by Father President, John LoSchiavo, S.J., in a dispute over management of a $1,000,000 donation.
In 1987 he was a Peritus at the Seventh Ordinary General Assembly of Bishops, held at the Vatican, and delivered a paper arguing that girls and women should be excluded from the offices of altar server and lector at the Catholic Mass.
He was the editor of 30 Days, In the Church and the World, from 1988 to 1991, and in 1991 became the publisher of the Catholic World Report. In 1995 he was the publisher of Catholic Dossier, Catholic Faith, and Homiletic & Pastoral Review.

209,"A blackwater river is a type of river with a slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. As vegetation decays, tannins leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, resembling tea or black coffee. Most major blackwater rivers are in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States. The term is used in fluvial studies, geology, geography, ecology, and biology. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black loam, are simply black due to the color of the soil; these rivers are black mud rivers. There are also black mud estuaries.
Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ from both whitewater and clearwater rivers. The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear, and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined by chemistry and physics by Harald Sioli (de) from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although many Amazonian rivers fall clearly into one of these categories, others show a mix of characteristics and may vary depending on season and flood levels.


== Comparison between white and black waters ==
Black and white waters differ significantly in their ionic composition, as shown in Table 1. Black waters are more acidic, resulting in an aluminum concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters. The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium; these are very low in black waters. This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.
Black and white waters differ in their planktonic fauna and flora. Tables 2 and 3 compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the Rio Negro system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of rotifers but fewer crustaceans and mites. These crustaceans are important foods for larval fish. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to ostracods and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table 3, which compares animals in 10 litres (2.2 imp gal; 2.6 US gal) of water.


== Comparison between clear and black waters ==
Blackwater rivers resemble clearwater rivers in having a low conductivity and relatively low levels of dissolved solids, but clearwater rivers have water that often only is somewhat acidic (typical pH ~6.5) and very clear with a greenish color. The main Amazonian clearwater rivers have their source in the Brazilian Plateau (such as Tapajós, Tocantins, Xingu and some right tributaries of the Madeira), but some originate in the Guiana Shield (such as Nhamundá, Paru and Araguari).

211,"Ernestine Schumann-Heink (15 June 1861 – 17 November 1936) was a German Bohemian, later American, operatic contralto. She was noted for the size, beauty, tonal richness, flexibility and wide range of her voice.


== Early life ==
She was born Ernestine Amalie Pauline Rössler to a German-speaking family in the town of Libeň (German: Lieben), Bohemia, Austrian Empire, which is now part of the city of Prague, Czech Republic. Her father, Hans Rössler, was a shoe maker; while previously serving as an Austrian cavalry officer, he had been stationed in northern Italy (then an Austrian protectorate), where he met and married Charlotte Goldman, with whom he returned to Libeň.
When Ernestine was three years old, the family moved to Verona. In 1866, at the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, the family moved to Prague, where she was schooled at the Ursuline Convent. At war's end, the Roesslers moved to Podgórze, now part of Kraków. The family moved again to Graz when Tini was thirteen. Here she met Marietta von LeClair, a retired opera singer, who agreed to give her voice lessons.
In 1877, Rössler made her first professional performance, in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Graz, appearing with soprano Maria Wilt, and her operatic debut at Dresden's Royal Opera House on 15 October 1878 as Azucena in Il trovatore.


== First marriage ==
On January 11, 1883 in Dresden, Germany, she married Johann Georg Ernst Albert Heink (1854–1933), secretary of the Semperoper, the Saxon State Opera Dresden; this violated the terms of their contracts, and both had their employment abruptly terminated. Heink took a job at the local customs house and was soon transferred to Hamburg. Ernestine remained in Dresden to pursue her career, and eventually rejoined her husband when she secured a position at the Hamburg Opera. She went on to have four children with Heink. One of their children, Ferdinand Schumann-Heink (1893–1958) was a prolific, though mostly unbilled, Hollywood character actor. Other children were Hans Schumann-Heink, and Arthur Schumann-Heink.
Ernest Heink was again thrown out of work when Saxons were banned from government positions, and departed to Saxony to find work. Ernestine, pregnant, did not follow him; they were divorced in 1893. That same year she married actor Paul Schumann, with whom she had three more children. Her second marriage lasted until Paul Schumann's death in 1904. She came to the United States to make a brief foray into the Broadway theater, playing in Julian Edwards' operetta Love's Lottery, in which her performance was noted for the fact that she often broke off to ask the audience whether her English was good enough. She left the production after 50 performances and soon returned to opera.
Her breakthrough into leading roles was provided when prima donna Marie Goetze argued with the director of the Hamburg opera. He asked Ernestine to sing the title role of Carmen, without rehearsal, which she did to great acclaim. Goetze, in a fit of pique, cancelled out of the role of Fidès in Le prophète, to be performed the following night, and was again replaced by Ernestine. Schumann-Heink replaced Goetze as Ortrud in Lohengrin the following evening, one more time without rehearsal, and was offered a ten-year contract.


== Second marriage ==
After the divorce from her first husband, she married Curt Paul Schuman around 1895. He died in 1904. While fighting a legal battle in Germany over her late husband's estate, she filed her United States naturalization papers on February 10, 1905, and became a citizen on March 3, 1908.


== International career ==

She performed with Gustav Mahler at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, and became well known for her performances of the works of Richard Wagner at Bayreuth, singing at the Bayreuth Festivals from 1896 to 1914.
Schumann-Heink's first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City was in 1899, and performed regularly there until 1932. She recorded the first of her many musical ""gramophone"" performances in 1900. Several of these early sound recordings originally released on 78 RPM discs have been reissued on CD format and continue to impress due to Schumann-Heink's rich vocal tone quality and impressive musical technique.


== Third marriage ==
On May 27, 1905 in Chicago, Illinois she married her manager William Rapp, Jr. She and her new husband lived on Grandview Avenue, North Caldwell, New Jersey in her ""Villa Fides"" from April 1906 to December 1911; she then moved to 500 acres (2 km²) of farm land located just outside San Diego, California (in an area then known as Helix Hill – now known as Mt. Helix – in Grossmont), purchased by her in January 1910, where she would live for most of her life. Her residence there still stands.
In 1909, she created the role of Klytaemnestra in the debut of Richard Strauss's Elektra, of which she said she had no high opinion, calling it ""a fearful din"". Strauss was not entirely captivated by Schumann-Heink either; according to one story, during rehearsals he admonished the orchestra, ""Louder! I can still hear Madame Schumann-Heink!""
She separated from her husband on December 10, 1911. She filed for divorce in 1913. They divorced in 1914 and the appeals court upheld the lower court decision in 1915.
In 1915, she appeared as herself in the early documentary film Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World's Fair at San Francisco directed by Fatty Arbuckle, who also appears as himself in the film.


== Charitable work and community support ==

While living at North Caldwell, New Jersey Schumann-Heink became interested in efforts to honor President Grover Cleveland. The future president was born in 1837 in nearby Caldwell, New Jersey, where his father, Rev. Richard Cleveland was minister of the First Presbyterian Church. On 10 September 1912, Schumann-Heink performed a benefit concert at the church to raise money to purchase the adjacent Presbyterian Manse, Cleveland's birthplace. In 1913, the Grover Cleveland Birthplace Memorial Association (GCBMA) purchased the Manse and opened it to the public as a museum. Mme. Schumann-Heink became the first lifetime member of the GCBMA.
During World War I, Schumann-Heink supported the United States and its armed forces. She entertained the troops and raised money to help wounded veterans. She toured the United States raising money for the war effort, although she had relatives fighting on both sides of the war – including her sons August Heink, a merchant sailor who had been impressed into the German submarine service, Walter Schumann, Henry Heink and George Washington Schumann, all in the United States Navy.


== Later years ==
In 1926, she first sang Silent Night (in both German and English) over the radio for Christmas. This became a Christmas tradition with US radio listeners through Christmas of 1935. In 1927, she performed in an early Vitaphone sound short film, possibly the only surviving footage of her singing. She lost most of her assets in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and was forced to sing again at age 69.
Her last performance at the Met was in 1932 performing Erda in Der Ring des Nibelungen, aged 71. In her later years, she had a weekly radio program. In the movies of the 1930s, many a buxom opera singer/instructor/matron was modeled on her; see for instance 1937's Stage Door.


== Death ==
Schumann-Heink died at 7:21 P.M. on 17 November 1936, aged 75, of leukemia in Hollywood, California. Her funeral was conducted by the American Legion at the Hollywood Post Auditorium, and her remains were interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego. Her archive went to the Smithsonian Institution.

212,"Joseph Marie Minala (born 24 August 1996) is a Cameroonian footballer who plays as a midfielder Serie B side Salernitana on loan from Lazio.


== Club career ==


=== Early career ===
At the age of 15, Minala left Yaoundé and moved to Rome. He began playing for amateur club Vigor Perconti and attracted the attention of Napoli, who gave him a two-month trial. He was spotted by Lazio scouts in 2013, while representing the region of Lazio in the Trofeo delle Regioni. He joined Lazio in the summer of 2013.
In early 2014, Minala then made news when his age was publicly disputed by multiple parties. Both Lazio and the player denied the claims. In May 2014, the Italian FA completed their investigation into the claims, confirming the accuracy of his given age and announcing that no disciplinary action would be taken against him or Lazio.

213,"Talvin Singh, OBE (born 1970 in London, England), is a producer and composer and tabla player, known for creating an innovative fusion of Indian classical music and drum and bass. Singh is generally considered involved with an electronica subgenre called Asian Underground, and more recently as Indian and/or Asian electronica.
After collaborating with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Björk in the early 1990s, Singh released his debut album Ok which received the Mercury Music Prize in 1999.
Singh has since collaborated with a variety of acts including Madonna and Massive Attack.


== Early life and career ==
Singh grew up in Leytonstone and began playing the tablas as a child. At the age of 16, Singh went to India for two years where he studied tabla under Pandit Lashman Singh. He then returned to the UK after just one year. In spite of this classical training, Singh's tabla playing was not accepted by British promoters of classical Indian music, as he incorporated too strongly his western influences. By the late 1980s, Singh had decided to turn towards the fusion of sounds. In 1991, he came to prominence by both playing tabla and singing on the ""Kiss Them for Me"" single by Siouxsie and the Banshees : the single peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23. Singh then became the sixth member of the Banshees and took part with them as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. Two years later in 1993, he was recruited by Björk to be her percussionist and director on her 1993 album, Debut.
In late 1995, Singh founded the Anokha club night with promoter Sweety Kapoor at East London's Blue Note, where drum'n'bass DJs and South Asian punk bands went head to head with the amped-up sounds of his tabla and percussion. Producer and DJ State of Bengal (Sam Zaman) soon became the core of Anokha alongside Singh & Kapoor, and his sets alongside Singhs help to inspire a whole generation.
Singh and Zaman would make fresh tracks, cutting them on Vinyl press hours before the Monday Anokha sessions where they would be showcased.
Guest spots by LTJ Bukem and others made Anokha a Monday-night hotspot in London, and Singh signed to Island for an Anokha compilation including several of his own productions. He worked as a remixer, for Blondie on their ""Maria"" single"".
In 1998, Singh released his solo debut album, Ok. The record was critically acclaimed and received the prestigious Mercury Music Prize in 1999. That same year, he also collaborated with David Sylvian. In 2000, he worked with Madonna for her album, Music.


== Style and influences ==
Singh is an accomplished Tabla player, electronic musician, music theorist, record producer and DJ. As a solo artist, he is perhaps best known as the father of modern Asian electronica music, though he is also a highly celebrated tabla player, record producer and visual practitioner.
Drawing inspiration from the classical Indian arts, Singh first came to prominence as a tabla percussionist in the 1980s London music scene. Whilst still in his mid-teens, Singh travelled to India to earn pupillage from Acharya Pandit Laxman Singh, master tabla maestro of the Punjab school. This period made an indelible mark on the young artist and he has since continued to practice and perform the art form internationally. Singh's collaborations with Indian classical musicians include Ustad Sultan Khan, Rakesh Churasia, Ustad Imrat Khan and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan amongst scores of others.
Singh also became involved in experimental music collaborations beginning in the late 1980s, working with Sun Ra and Courtney, which helped to popularise the burgeoning Asian underground sub-culture movement.
Singh is notable for re-introducing the concepts of Indian classical music to western pop, dance and Jazz genres in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Singh's solo album credits include critical and commercial successes Ok (1998)--which won the UK's two most prestigious music prizes, 'The South Bank Prize' and the Mercury Prize in 1999. Ok, his groundbreaking '98 debut release, was recorded in Mumbai, Madras, Okinawa, New York and London, featuring contributions from Bill Laswell, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ustad Sultan Khan and the Madras Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others.
Singh has pursued several artistic ventures parallel to and in conjunction with his music career, including creating the seminal London club ANOKHA, performing at the Tate Gallery in London, creating a sound installation at the Frith Street Gallery in London and composing music for various experimental dance, theatre and film projects. In 1990 Singh conceived the Tablatronic, a hybrid electronic/analog tabla (drum) which uses a rare internal microphone system. However, in a 2017 interview, he said he ""did not do fusion music"" and disliked the way Indian musicians felt they had to do fusion music.
Singh is now scoring Indian movies from his studio in Suffolk. The most recent movie he has worked on is called Once Again. He says he wants to score more movies.


== Interests ==
Talvin is a passionate animal lover. He owns a pet dog. In an interview with Times of India, he criticised the way development was happening in India with no thought to the impact on stray animals such as cows - and whether constructing buildings was actually development.

214,"Sister Christine Frost MBE (born 1937 in Limerick, Ireland) is a nun working and living in Poplar, London. She was awarded the MBE for her work in deprived areas of Tower Hamlets in the shadow of Canary Wharf, where she has been campaigning since the 1980s.
She launched the charity Neighbours in Poplar in 1968, to help older adults meet up and enjoy outings, and later South Poplar and Limehouse Action for Secure Housing (SPLASH), showing similar concern for teenagers. She is known locally for distributing Christmas meals to elderly and lonely people.
In 2010 she led a public protest against rigid restrictions introduced by Tower Hamlets Council in the name of safety following a tower block fire in south London.
On 8 August 2014, Frost removed an emblem resembling the Black Standard from the entrance to a Council estate in Poplar, as the local authority had been slow to react. She explained that the protesters had intended to express solidarity with Gaza, but had been unaware that other residents would be intimidated.

216,"Oscar Edward ""Ossie, King Oscar"" Hanson (December 27, 1909 in Camrose, Alberta – February 17, 1998) was a professional ice hockey centre. He played for the St Louis Flyers, Minneapolis Millers, St Paul Saints and he played in 8 NHL games for the Chicago Black Hawks.
Oscar ""Hansen"" (Most had Hanson and even in the news), the most news printed athlete in MN during his time and was the AHA League scoring champion in 1936-37 with 33 Goals in 47 games (62 Points) and again in 1938-39 with 37 goals in 48 games! (1938-39 Oscar had 89 Points!). Oscar was the best of the 5 [Hanson Brothers]( who all played for Augsburg College in Minnesota. These amazing brothers were the 1st line for the Olympic Team in 1928 (see http://hockeygods.com/images/12440-Augsburg_College_Ice_Hockey_Team___Hansons_of_Augsburg_1928). Oscar is regarded by many as one of the best to ever play the game. Gordie Howe raved about Oscar's skill and ability to ""Dangle"".
Oscar Hanson holds one of the most amazing college hockey record in hockey history of 3 goals in 1 minute at Augsburg College in Minnesota (USA).
Oscar developed a mysterious leg injury (at the end of 1939) which is now thought to be MS (Multiple Sclerosis) and left Oscar in a wheel chair for most of the 2nd half of his life. He was cared for and loved by his wife Freda Hansen. Oscar's son David Oscar Hansen was also an amazing MN hockey player scouted by the University of Minnesota as their top recruit. David's skill was equaled by his on ice temper which ultimately pushed he and the U of M apart. David Hansen Played hockey and boxed for the US Army with a number of MN greats.
Oscar and his brothers were given a homage by Paul Newman and crew in the 1977 Film Slapshot. Although the real life Hansen brothers (Oscar, Lewis, Joe, Julius and Emil) were far from this tale, one of the Hansen brothers {Emil} may have been forced to end an on ice fight by a State Trooper. These brothers were anything but goons as they dominated the College league and were put into national spotlight by their 1928 Olympic selection. The movie was a funny parody of their career, but make no mistake the real Hanson brothers were amazing.
US Olympic Fallout: Three short days before the 1st game of the 1928 Olympics General MacArthur made a call stating that ""We are not playing this year"". This was a result of the ""Cold"" relationship between Russia and the US. The Russians raised questions about the Hanson's being American born. General MacArthur had papers showing the family was born in the US and moved to Canada to operate a large farm. General MacArthur was under presidential orders to pull out of the Olympic game as US and Russia were already on the brinks.
Later in Life: Oscar and Freda Hansen lived their later years in Edina, MN with their son David close by. David and his children (Melissa, Malinda and Curtis) remained close with Oscar and Freda until their passing.

218,"Pasch (1935–1939) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire, best known for winning the classic 2000 Guineas in 1938, a year in which he started favourite for all three legs of the Triple Crown. In a brief racing career which lasted from April to October of his three-year-old season, he ran six times, recording three wins, one second, and two third places. Apart from his win in the Guineas, he won the Eclipse Stakes and was placed in The Derby, St Leger Stakes and Champion Stakes. He was then retired to stud but died after siring a single crop of foals.


== Background ==
Pasch bay horse with a narrow white blaze and one white foot bred his owner Henry E. Morriss, a Shanghai-based bullion broker. He was sired by Blandford, a highly successful breeding stallion whose other notable winners included Bahram, Windsor Lad, Blenheim, Trigo and Brantome. Pasch's dam Pasca was a daughter of Morriss's Derby winner Manna out of the mare Soubriquet, a half-sister of Fifinella. Soubriquet was a high class runner in her own right, winning five races and finishing second in both the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks. At the end of her racing career she was bought by Morriss for 12,500 guineas to become a broodmare. Pasca won two minor races and also produced Pasqua, the dam of the Derby winner Pinza. Morriss sent the colt into training with Fred Darling at his stable at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. At Darling's stable, Pasch was lodged in the box which had previously been occupied by the Derby winners Coronach and Manna.


== Racing career ==


=== 1938:three-year-old season ===
Pasch was unraced as a two-year-old after sustaining an injury to his pastern in the spring. Although he recovered by autumn it was decided not to race him until the following year. He was highly regarded by his owner who described him in November 1937 as a colt who might ""be heard of next year in the classic races, as he is very good"".
In 1938 he began his racing career by winning the Coventry Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse on 16 April. He was then stepped up in class to contest the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket eleven days later. Despite his lack of experience, and an unfavourable draw, the colt was strongly supported in the betting and started the 5/2 favourite in a field of eighteen runners. Pasch started quickly and led in the early stages before being settled by the champion jockey Gordon Richards. He regained the lead at half way and despite showing his inexperience by ""looking round him like a novice"" he won by two lengths from Scottish Union and Mirza. Richards said that the colt had won with at least seven pounds in hand, adding ""I really cannot see what can beat him in the Derby."" It was also noted that the colt's quick, ""bouncing"" action was ideally suited to the prevailing fast ground. Other observers however, felt that Pasch's excitable temperament would be a disadvantage in the Epsom classic.
By 1 June, when the Derby was run over one and a half miles at Epsom, the ground had been softened by rain. Although he was racing in more testing conditions than he had previously encountered, Pasch started the 9/4 favourite against twenty-one opponents. He moved up to challenge the leader Scottish Union in the straight and looked likely to win before Bois Roussel, a French colt who had arrived in Darling's stable two weeks before the race, produced a ""spectacular finish"" to win by four lengths. Pasch lost second place by two lengths to Scottish Union with Richards offering no real excuses, although he did state that the favourite had ""hated coming down the hill"". Pasch was then brought back in distance and matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown. He started at odds of 13/8 and won impressively by three lengths from the four-year-old Fair Copy, with Scottish Union in fourth.
On 7 September, Pasch ran in the St Leger Stakes over one mile, six and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. He started favourite but finished third of the nine runners beaten a neck and four lengths by Scottish Union and Challenge. After the St Leger it was announced that Pasch had been retired but he returned for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. He was expected to end his career with a win but was beaten five lengths by the filly Rockfel.


== Assessment ==
In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pasch an ""average"" winner of the 2000 Guineas.


== Stud record ==
Pasch was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Morriss's Banstead Manor stud. After completing one season at stud he became ill in September 1939 and died shortly afterwards of meningitis. His foals included a filly named Pasquinade who became a successful broodmare, producing Royal Serenade (Nunthorpe Stakes, Hollywood Gold Cup) and Royal Palm (Nunthorpe Stakes).

221,"Thimmamma Marrimanu is a banyan tree in Anantapur, located about 25 kilometers from Kadiri, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is probably a specimen of Ficus benghalensis. In the Telugu language, ""marri"" denotes ""banyan"" and ""manu"" denotes ""trees"". Its canopy covers 19,107 m2 (4.721 acres), and it was recorded as the largest tree specimen in the world in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1989. 


== Legend ==
A Telugu account preserved at the shrine says that the daughter of a Settibalija couple, who were named Sennakka Venkatappa and Mangamma, was born in AD 1394. She married Bala Veerayya, who died in 1434, and Thimmamma committed sati. She was a just lady who served her ailing husband devotedly. The tree is believed to have sprouted at the place of her ascension of the funeral pyre. Specifically, it is believed that the northeastern pole of the pyre grew into this tree.


== Religious significance ==
A small temple dedicated to Thimmamma is beneath the tree. The residents of the region strongly believe that if a childless couple worships Thimmamma they will beget a child in the next year. A large jatara is conducted at Thimmamma on the day of the Shivaratri festival, when thousands flock to the tree to worship it.


== Recordation ==
The tree was first noticed and revealed to the world by Regret Iyer (Sathyanarayana Iyer), a freelance journalist and photographer from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Later he made all efforts to have the tree recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records. His name was included in the Book in this regard.
Thimmamma Marrimanu was discussed in the second segment of the BBC series 'The Tree Spirits' (29 Aug 2017)

222,"MV San Demetrio was a British motor tanker, notable for her service during the Second World War. She was built in 1938 for the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company. In 1940 she was damaged by enemy action in mid-Atlantic, abandoned by her crew but later re-boarded and successfully brought into harbour. She was the subject of a 1943 feature film, San Demetrio London, one of the few films that recognised the heroism of the UK Merchant Navy crews during the War.
San Demetrio was one of several motor tankers of about 8,000 GRT built for Eagle Oil and Shipping in the latter 1930s. She was built by the Blythswood Shipbuilding Company of Glasgow, who had also launched her sister ships San Conrado in 1936 and San Cipriano in 1937.


== Convoy HX-84 ==
San Demetrio had loaded 11,200 tons of aviation fuel in Galveston, Texas and was bound for Avonmouth, England. She was one of 38 ships that joined Convoy HX-84 for the passage across the North Atlantic and left Halifax, Nova Scotia on 28 October 1940. The Town-class destroyers HMCS Columbia and HMCS St. Francis escorted the convoy out of Canadian home waters but once clear of the coast, the convoy's sole escort was the armed merchant cruiser HMS Jervis Bay — a converted passenger liner that had been armed with seven outdated BL 6 inch Mk VII naval guns and a pair of 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft guns.


== Attack by Admiral Scheer ==
On 5 November 1940, the German cruiser Admiral Scheer found the convoy at 50°30′N 32°00′W and attacked immediately. Captain E.S.F. Fegen of HMS Jervis Bay steamed out towards the raider so as to delay Admiral Scheer to allow the convoy to scatter and escape. Jervis Bay was completely outclassed, but she fought for 22 minutes before she was sunk with the loss of 190 of her crew. Their sacrifice, followed by a four-hour cat-and-mouse battle with the convoy freighter SS Beaverford enabled most of the merchantmen from Convoy HX-84 to escape. Fegen received a posthumous Victoria Cross.
Admiral Scheer now tried to sink as many of the convoy as possible before darkness fell. She hit San Demetrio with several shells that destroyed the bridge and poop deck and left the upper deck in flames. Despite both the exploding shells and the resultant fire, the ship's highly flammable cargo did not explode. Nevertheless, her Master, Captain Waite, believed that the fire could set off the aviation fuel at any moment so he gave the order to abandon ship. With the ship remaining under fire from Admiral Scheer, the crew escaped in two lifeboats. Admiral Scheer then turned her attention to other ships of the rapidly scattering convoy.


== Re-boarding ==
The two lifeboats separated in the night, and the lifeboat with the captain and twenty-five crew was picked up and taken to Newfoundland. The sixteen men in the other lifeboat, including Second Officer Arthur G. Hawkins and Chief Engineer Charles Pollard, drifted for 24 hours when they sighted a burning ship. To their surprise, they discovered that it was their own ship, San Demetrio. With few alternatives, the crew had to decide whether to risk death by exposure or to re-board and risk the fire. In the end they chose to remain in the lifeboat because the fire was too great and the weather too hazardous to attempt boarding, but after a second night in the boat and enduring a freezing North Atlantic winter gale, they regretted not re-boarding the tanker.

At dawn the following day, 7 November 1940, the San Demetrio was about 5 nautical miles (9 km) downwind so the crew set sail toward her and re-boarded. They fought the fire, repaired the port auxiliary boiler sufficiently to restart the ship's pumps and dynamos and repaired the auxiliary steering gear. No charts or navigational instruments had survived so the crew estimated a course from occasional glimpses of the sun. Her radio had not survived either. They managed to sail the tanker across the rest of the Atlantic, braving bad weather and U-boats. After seven days the San Demetrio reached waters off Ireland, from where they were escorted on to the mouth of the River Clyde, docking on 16 November 1940. They declined the offer of a tow from a tug because of the high cost.
Despite the damage and fire, only 200 tons of San Demetrio's highly volatile cargo had been lost. There was only one fatality, John Boyle, who had been injured jumping into the lifeboat after the original battle and gradually began to feel unwell. He was propped up in the engine room, to watch the gauges, but died of a haemorrhage after two days. He was posthumously awarded the King's Commendation for Brave Conduct.
Since the crew had received no assistance from another vessel, in the ensuing case in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, they were able to claim the salvage money from the insurers for the ship and cargo. The oil and freight cargo were valued at £60,000. The ship herself, almost new, was worth £250,000. The High Court awarded the claimants £14,700 salvage money: £2,000 of it going to Second Officer Hawkins; £1,000 to the estate of John Boyle. Another £1,000 went to 26-year-old Oswald Ross Preston, an American seaman, because he played a ""magnificent"" part when the battle started. Hawkins was also given the tattered Red Ensign of the ship.
Salvage Payouts:
Second Officer Hawkins was awarded the OBE for his gallantry. Chief Engineer Charles Pollard and Deck Apprentice John Lewis Jones each received the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea. San Demetrio was repaired and returned to service.


== Sinking ==
On 14 March 1942 San Demetrio sailed unescorted from Baltimore, Maryland bound for the UK via Halifax, Nova Scotia with a cargo of 4,000 tons of alcohol and 7,000 tons of aviation spirit. On 17 March she was northwest of Cape Charles, Virginia when the German submarine U-404 torpedoed and sank her. 16 crew and three DEMS gunners were lost, and six crew wounded, but survivors managed to launch two lifeboats. Two days later the US tanker SS Beta rescued the Master, 26 crew and five DEMS gunners and took them to Norfolk, Virginia. The Master, Conrad Vidot, was awarded the Lloyd's War Medal.


== Film ==
The ship's part in Convoy HX-84 was made into a film, San Demetrio London in 1943, starring Walter Fitzgerald, Mervyn Johns, Ralph Michael, and Robert Beatty. It was one of the few films to recognise the heroism of British Merchant Navy crews during the war.


== Book ==
One of the ship's crew, Able Seaman Calum Macneil, wrote a book called San Demetrio, which was published by Angus and Robertson in 1957. It is a personal account of leaving his previous ship and joining the crew of the San Demetrio. He was one of the crew who abandoned the ship then re-boarded during the voyage of Convoy HX-84. During the war an account ""The Story of San Demetrio"" was published to boost morale.


== Art depictions and museum holdings ==

A wartime poster entitled ""San Demetrio gets home"" was issued by the Post Office Savings Bank. It featured a painting of the ship by Charles Pears. She is also depicted in two works by marine painter Norman Wilkinson. The 'San Demetrio' at the Jervis Bay action, 5 November 1940 is held by the National Maritime Museum (NMM), while The Crew Reboarding the Tanker 'San Demetrio', 7 November 1940 is held by the Imperial War Museum (IWM). The NMM collection also includes the ship's bell. The IWM collection includes the compass (pictured right), a fragment of her wheel, and two models of the ship. One of these models was made by Ealing Studios for use in the making of the film San Demetrio London. The compass along with two newspaper cuttings (pictured right) were stored in John Jamieson's father's tenement from 1940 until 1972 at 600 Paisley Road West, Glasgow, then in Southampton, before being donated to the Imperial War Museum.

225,"The Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) is a satellite designed to investigate changes in the Earth's ionosphere and is scheduled for launch in December 2017. The mission is being led by the University of California, Berkeley and will be a new addition to NASA's Explorer program. ICON will provide NASA’s Heliophysics Division with a new capability to understand the tug-of-war between Earth’s atmosphere and the space environment. In the ""no man's land"" of the ionosphere, a continuous struggle between solar forcing and Earth’s weather systems drive extreme and unpredicted variability. ICON will investigate the forces at play in the near-space environment, leading the way in understanding disturbances that can lead to severe interference with communications and GPS signals.
On April 12, 2013, NASA announced that ICON, along with Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD), had been selected for development with the cost capped at $200 million, excluding launch costs. The principal investigator of ICON is Thomas Immel at the University of California, Berkeley.


== Mission concept ==

Once launched, ICON will perform a two-year mission to observe conditions in both the thermosphere and ionosphere. ICON will be equipped with four instruments: a Michelson interferometer, built by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, will measure the winds and temperatures in the thermosphere; an ion drift meter, built by University of Texas at Dallas, will measure the motion of charged particles in the ionosphere; and two Ultraviolet imagers built at UC Berkeley will observe the airglow layers in the upper atmosphere in order to determine both ionospheric and thermospheric density and composition.

226,"Harold Gregory ""Hal"" Moore, Jr. (February 13, 1922 – February 10, 2017) was a United States Army lieutenant general and author. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, which is the U.S. military's second highest decoration for valor, and was the first of his West Point class (1945) to be promoted to brigadier general, major general, and lieutenant general.
Moore is best remembered as the lieutenant colonel in command of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, during the Vietnam War. The battle was made into the movie We Were Soldiers in 2002, which starred actor Mel Gibson as Moore; Moore was the ""honorary colonel"" of the regiment.
In 2007, Moore's volunteer driver wrote a book on Moore's personal religious journey titled A General's Spiritual Journey. In 2013, author Mike Guardia published the first full-length biography of Moore's life and career titled Hal Moore: A Soldier Once...and Always.
Moore was awarded the Order of Saint Maurice by the National Infantry Association as well as the Distinguished Graduate Award by the West Point Association of Graduates.


== Early life and education ==
Moore was born on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four children born to Harold, Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky and his mother was a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and felt his chances were better if he was located in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C. working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal (4th District, Kentucky) but Moore had no desire to go to the Naval Academy. Moore asked Creal if he could find another congressman that would trade his Military Academy appointment for Creal's Naval Academy appointment would he be agreeable to that arrangement. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, with an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore's tenacity and he left Cox's office with the West Point appointment.


== Military service ==


=== West Point ===
Moore received his appointment to the U.S. Military Academy shortly after the United States entered into World War II. He reported to West Point for ""Reception Day"" on July 15, 1942, and the summer training referred to as ""Beast Barracks"" held before the formal academic school term took up in the fall. During his plebe summer at Pine Camp, he qualified expert on the M-1 Garand rifle and was the top scorer in his company. Although Moore did well in most of his classes, he was academically deficient in the required math subjects and he had to redouble his efforts to absorb the engineering, physics and chemistry, often studying two or three hours past lights out to memorize the material. During the fall of 1942 his class received the news that because of the war his class would graduate in three years rather than the usual four years. Moore made it through the plebe year, but just barely, or as he put it, ""an academic trip from hell."" This observation caused Moore to lead a student life at West Point devoted to studying and very few extracurricular activities. After a ten-day furlough, he reported to Camp Popolopen for summer military training where his company trained with various vehicles and fired many types of weapons. The summer ended with maneuvers held again at Pine Camp. During the second year at the Academy, he studied more complicated subjects like calculus, electrical engineering, thermodynamics and historic military campaigns. Wednesdays were spent watching the latest Staff Combat Film Report which reported the most recent fighting from the Pacific and European war fronts. Summer military training after his second year consisted of touring U.S. Army basic training centers to study tactics and techniques. The final academic year was spent studying military history and tactics as the war was winding down in Europe. Just before graduation each cadet selected his branch of assignment dependent on their academic standing in the class and the quota of openings in each branch. Moore stood in the bottom fifteen percent and he wanted an infantry assignment. When his name was finally called to declare, there were still infantry openings available. Moore graduated from West Point on June 5, 1945 and he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry branch.


=== Post-World War II ===
Moore's first assignment after graduation was the Infantry Officer Basic Course at Fort Benning, Georgia which was a six-week course. During the basic course he applied for the airborne jump school at Fort Benning, however, he was not selected and was instead assigned to the three-week jump school held at the 11th Airborne Division in Tokyo, Japan. His first assignment out of jump school was with the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment at Camp Crawford near Sapporo, Japan from 1945 until 1948. After a seven-month stint as company commander, he was assigned as Camp Crawford's construction officer and responsible for all of the construction improvements being made at the camp. In June 1948 he was reassigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg. He volunteered to join the Airborne Test Section, a special unit testing experimental parachutes, and he made the first of some 150 jumps with the section over the next two years on November 17, 1948. Over the course of his career, he became a master parachutist with over 300 jumps.


=== Korean War ===
During the Korean War (1950–1953) in 1951, he was ordered to Fort Benning to attend the Infantry Officer's Advanced Course, which would prepare him to command a company or to serve on a battalion staff. In June 1952 Moore was assigned to the 17th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division. As a captain, he commanded a heavy mortar company in combat. He next served as regimental Assistant Chief-of-Staff, Operations and Plans. Moore's promotion to major was put on hold by a policy of the 7th Division commanding general that stated that no promotion to major would be possible without command of an infantry company in combat. The division commander personally assigned Moore to an infantry company so that Moore could be promoted to major and thus later become divisional assistant chief-of staff for operations.


=== Stateside service ===
In 1954, Moore returned to West Point and served for three years as an instructor in infantry tactics. While serving as an instructor, Moore taught then-Cadet Norman Schwarzkopf, who called Moore one of his ""heroes,"" and cites Moore as the reason he chose the infantry branch upon graduation. Schwarzkopf later became a general in the U.S. Army and led the U.N. coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq. During this assignment, Moore took a personal interest in the battles between the French Army forces and the Việt Minh at Điện Biên Phủ in Vietnam.
Moore was assigned to attend the year-long student course at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1956. The course prepared majors for the duties of staff officers at the division and corps level. After school at Fort Leavenworth, Moore reported to the Pentagon and the Office, Chief of Research and Development where his initiative and insights were key to the development of new airborne equipment and airborne/air assault tactics. Following graduation from the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia in 1960 Moore served a three-year tour as NATO Plans Officer with Headquarters, Allied Forces Northern Europe in Oslo, Norway.
In 1964, now a lieutenant colonel, Moore completed the course of study at the Naval War College, while earning a master's degree in International Relations from George Washington University in Washington, DC. Moore was transferred to Fort Benning and commanded 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry later to become a part of 11th Air Assault Division, undergoing air assault and air mobility training and tests. On July 28, 1965 President Lyndon Johnson announced that he was sending ""the Airmobile Division to Vietnam"". That same month the 11th Air Assault Division was re-designated the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and alerted for deployment to Vietnam. Moore's battalion was re-designated as 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, the same regiment that was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Custer when the Irish song Garry Owen was adopted as a marching tune. The ""Garry Owen"" Brigade left Fort Benning August 14, 1965 and went to South Vietnam by way of the Panama Canal aboard USNS General Maurice Rose arriving at the Division's An Khê Base Camp a month later.


=== Vietnam War ===


==== Battle of la Drang ====

Beginning on November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the week-long Battle of Ia Drang. Encircled by enemy soldiers with no clear landing zone that would allow them to leave, Moore managed to persevere despite being significantly outnumbered by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces that would go on to defeat the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry only two-and-a-half miles away the next day. Moore's dictum that ""there is always one more thing you can do to increase your odds of success"" and the courage of his entire command are credited with this outcome. Blond haired Moore was known as ""Yellow Hair"" to his troops at the battle at Ia Drang, and as a tongue-in-cheek homage referencing the legendary General George Armstrong Custer, who commanded as a lieutenant colonel the same 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn just under a century before. Moore was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism at Ia Drang. After the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, Moore was promoted to colonel and took over the command of the Garry Owen (3rd) Brigade.


=== Post-Vietnam War service ===
After his service in the Vietnam War, Moore served at the Pentagon as the military liaison to the Assistant Secretary for International affairs in the Office of Under Secretary of Defense. In his next assignment the Army sent him to Harvard University where he completed his M.A in International Relations in 1968. Having completed his work at Harvard, Moore reported back to the Pentagon to work with the Deputy Chief-of-Staff for Operations. He then helped draft the Army plan for the withdrawal of two brigades of the 9th Infantry Division to the United States as a part of the Vietnamization of the war effort. On August 31, 1968, Moore was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In July 1969, he was assigned as Assistant Chief-of-Staff, Operations and Plans of the Eighth Army in South Korea where tensions were high from incidents along the demilitarized zone and drug use and racism among Eighth Army troops were at an all-time high. Shortly after becoming Commanding General of the 7th Infantry Division Moore was promoted to major general in 1970 and he and his family moved to Camp Casey, South Korea. He was charged by General John H. Michaelis, Commander, United States Forces Korea with cleaning up the drug abuse problem and racial strife that was prevalent at the time in the 7th Division. His plan established Officer's Leadership Schools for company grade officers and a NCO Leadership School for staff sergeants and below as well as issuing an ""Equal Opportunity Policy"". He backed up the policy with the promise to punish those leaders who discriminated based on race, ethnicity or creed. As a part of the reformation of division morale he established several different athletic programs, including football, basketball, and boxing. As Commanding General of the Army Training Center at Fort Ord, California in 1971–1973, he oversaw extensive experimentation in adapting basic and advanced individual training under Project VOLAR in preparation for the end of conscription and the institution of the Modern Volunteer Army. In August 1973, Moore was assigned as Commanding General, US Army Military Personnel Center (MILPERCEN), and in 1974 he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Department of the Army; his last assignment before leaving the Army. He dealt with Army recruiting issues after the termination of the draft as well as the orderly drawdown of forces after the close of the Vietnam War. Moore's next assignment was to become the Commanding General, U.S. Army Japan but he elected to retire instead. Moore retired from the Army August 1, 1977 after completing thirty two years of active service.


== Personal life ==
While assigned to Fort Bragg, Moore met Julia B. Compton, the daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Louis J. Compton. Julia was a student enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina and happened to be visiting her parents at Fort Bragg. They were married at the Fort Bragg main post chapel on November 22, 1949. After his retirement in 1977, Moore served as the Executive President of the Crested Butte Ski Area, Colorado. In June 2009, the 87-year-old Moore attended the formal opening of the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia. One of the featured exhibits of the museum is a life-size diorama of L.Z. X-Ray from the Battle of Ia Drang. The Moores had five children, Greg Moore, Steve Moore, Julie Moore Orlowski, Cecile Moore Rainey, and David Moore, as well as twelve grandchildren. Two of their sons are career U.S. Army officers: one a retired colonel and another a retired lieutenant colonel.
Moore died on February 10, 2017, three days before his 95th birthday.


== Bibliography ==
In 1975, the United States Army Center of Military History published Building a Volunteer Army: The Fort Ord Contribution, by Moore and Lieutenant Colonel Jeff M. Tuten. The 139-page paperback is a monograph concerning the Project VOLAR experiments during Moore's tenure in command of Fort Ord in 1971–1973 in preparation for the end of the draft and the implementation of the Modern Volunteer Army.
In 1992 Moore wrote We Were Soldiers Once… And Young with co-author Joseph L. Galloway. The book was adapted into the 2002 film We Were Soldiers, which was filmed at Forts Benning and Hunter Liggett, depicting Moore's command of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, at Fort Benning and in the Battle of Ia Drang.
Moore and Joseph L. Galloway wrote another book together, a follow-up to their first collaboration. We Are Soldiers Still; A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam was published in 2008. Moore and Galloway reunited to give an interview on the book at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library on September 17, 2008.

227,"Dharmendra Kumar Tyagi, better known as Deep Tyagi or DK Tyagi (1928–1969), was an Assistant Commissioner for the Indian Family Planning program until 1969. An early pioneer of family planning in India and elsewhere, he was a champion of the program under the premierships of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, and the initial period of Indira Gandhi. He invented the now-pervasive (in India and some other countries) ""Red Triangle"" symbol as a branding effort to familiarize and popularize the idea of family planning.
Many of the mass communication techniques he developed are now used throughout the developing world to combat disease (such as HIV/AIDS) and poverty. Part of the mission statement of the present-day foundation, DKT International, which was named in his honor reads - ""He was 41 years old at the time of his death, but had already made a major contribution to his country’s family planning effort. It was he who was largely responsible for the design and dissemination of a massive communication program that brought awareness and knowledge of family planning to hundreds of millions of Indians. He began his work at a time (1966) when modern contraceptive methods were virtually unknown in rural India. His success in saturating the country with simple, attractive messages and designs (including the Red Triangle, which is now in use in several other countries) overcame age-old communication barriers and greatly increased public awareness of birth control.""


== Life ==
Deep Tyagi was born in Ratangarh village of Uttar Pradesh in 1928. He died of cancer at the age of 41, in 1969. He had no children.

== Pest Species and Impacts ==
In the United States, two species are major pests of cucurbits, the striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum), which is mainly found east of the Mississippi River, and Acalymma trivittatum which is mostly found west of the Mississippi. Adults feed on young leaves, and larvae can damage roots. A. vittatum vectors bacterial wilt Erwinia tracheiphila Holland (Enterobacteriales: Enterobacteriaceae) to the plants as it pierces plant stems to suck juices.

233,"Monmouth Jet Center (IATA: BLM, ICAO: KBLM, FAA LID: BLM) is a privately owned, public use airport in Monmouth County, New Jersey. It is in Wall Township six miles west of Belmar, east of Farmingdale. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport. Prior to 2003, it was known as Allaire Airport. The airport was sold on December 3, 2013 to a consortium known as Wall Aviation. The new owners intend to evict current renters and upgrade the facility to serve corporate clients.
In an analysis by the Regional Plan Association in 2011, Monmouth Jet scored highly as a potential airport for airline flights to expand capacity and relieve aviation congestion in the New York area.


== Facilities ==
Monmouth Jet Center covers 850 acres (344 ha) at an elevation of 153 feet (47 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 7,371 by 85 feet (2,247 x 26 m) and 3/21 is 3,512 by 50 feet (1,070 x 15 m).
In the year ending January 1, 2010 the airport had 57,229 aircraft operations, average 156 per day: 83% general aviation and 17% air taxi.


== Incidents and accidents ==
On February 15, 2010 a small aircraft, identified as a Cessna 337, crashed on approach to the airport, killing all five people on board. The NTSB accident report indicated that the pilot made an abrupt maneuver while exceeding the operating limitations of the aircraft which caused a structural failure of the right wing.
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: The pilots’ failure to adhere to the airplane’s operating limitations, which resulted in overload failure of the right wing. Findings of the investigation were the adverse effects of multiple supplemental type certificates (STC) to the airframe wing structure that were not evaluated at the time the STCs were installed and the lack of guidance by the Federal Aviation Administration for multiple STC interaction evaluation.

== History ==
A small village in the northwest part of Apple Creek Township; German settlers arrived in the Friedheim area in the 1840s fleeing political unrest back home. These German Lutheran settlers built their own log church in 1849, which was later replaced by the current stone church in 1857. A post office was established here in 1887 and named by the German settlers for their old home Friedheim, Germany. Friedheim is home to Trinity Lutheran church, a member of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod.

236,"Masdevallia unguentum was discovered in 2010 in the collection of Finca Dracula and is reported from Colombia. It is morphologically similar to Masdevallia marthae which was also discovered in cultivation without collection data but was later re-discovered in 1993 on the road to a television tower in the Department of Risaralda, Colombia  Both are members of the subsection Saltatrices which is characterized by flowers with a tubular calyx.


== Etymology ==
From the Latin ""unguentum"", an ointment used to perfume the body. The name alludes to the aromatic flowers and their similarity to Masdevallia saltatrix, a species named for female dancers.
Pronunciation: ""u - ng - w - ə - nt- (ə) - m""


== Description ==
Masdevallia unguentum is from an unknown origin but most likely originates from Colombia. The species is a miniature, presumably epiphytic, herb with erect, elliptic leaves. The flowers are born singly on thin stems as long as the leaf and emit a spicy fragrance. The species keys out to Masdevallia saltatrix but can easily be distinguished by the odor, striped rather than spotted calyx, and the tail that rests against the back of the tube.


== Cultivation ==
The species can be cultivated like other intermediate to cool (day: 56–64 F; night: 48–56 F) growing masdevallias. They require high humidity (65–95%) with strong air movement to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Light should be medium to bright shade (600–1400 footcandles). The plants should be reported before the medium breaks down in either a bark based mix or in sphagnum moss. They should be fertilized with a half-strength mixture of a balanced fertilizer once a month and a high nitrogen fertilizer can be used for single applications in the spring and fall.
The plants can be propagated by division or sexually. After pollination the capsule will require about 90 days to mature and the seeds can be grown under asceptic conditions using G & B Orchid Laboratories' Mother Flask Medium V with charcoal or Phytamax Orchid Maintenance Medium. Seedlings require high humidity and should be fertilized every two weeks and may produce their first flowers in 1 to 4 years.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 565, the magic mill. Other tales of this type include Why the Sea Is Salt and The Water Mother.


== Content ==
There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother, and they no longer had anything to eat. So the child went into the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her sorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said, ""Cook, little pot, cook,"" would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she said, ""Stop, little pot,"" it ceased to cook. The girl took the pot home to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose. Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, ""Cook, little pot, cook."" And it did cook and she ate until she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word. So it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the next house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest distress, but no one knew how to stop it. At last when only one single house remained, the child came home and just said, ""Stop, little pot,"" and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat their way back!

240,"Gonnema was a Khoikhoi chieftain of the Cochoqua tribe in 17th century South Africa. He was the primary antagonist of the Dutch East India Company in the Second Khoikhoi–Dutch War.
Despite the Company's opposition to war with the Khoikhoi, individual soldiers aroused the ire of the Cochoqua by looting their cattle; by the early 1670s, Gonnema and his tribe were sufficiently incensed to take up arms. In 1673 Gonnema murdered a hunting party of eight burghers. A commando unit led by Ensign Hieronymous Cruse was sent against him, which failed to capture the tribe's kraal. However, they were successful in taking prisoners, who were subsequently executed. Gonnema's men also attacked and plundered the Company's fort at Saldhana Bay. Beyond these attacks, Gonnema waged a primarily defensive strategy for the remainder of the hostilities.
The following year a combined force of Europeans, burghers and Khoikhoi (the Goringhaiqua and Gorochouqua tribes) was sent against Gonnema, but again failed to capture him. Rather than retaliating immediately, Gonnema responded by preventing the local tribes from trading with the Europeans, although in November he raided the Europeans' Khoikhoi allies. He attacked the Goringhaiquas and Gorochouquas again at Tigerberg in early 1675, where fifteen Cochoquas were killed by Dutch East Inda Company reinforcements. Gonnema himself, however, escaped once again.
Another commando unit was sent against the Cochoqua in 1676, but again they failed to capture Gonnema, returning instead with a handful of prisoners and several hundred head of cattle.
By 1677 Gonnema was willing to sue for peace, an act which was well received by the Dutch. A settlement was reached whereby Gonnema's tribe would pay tribute of 30 head of cattle each year.

243,"Chikka, short for Chikka Text Messenger, is an Internet-based instant messaging application that supports free SMS or text messaging between online users and offline mobile subscribers. Chikka was released by Chikka Philippines, Inc. in the early 2000 and eventually established its connection with the country's network operators Smart Communications (2001), Globe Telecom (2002) and Sun Cellular (2004). With up to billions of messages being exchanged between online and mobile communities worldwide through Chikka, it is probably the world's first commercially successful integration of web and mobile utilities.
Headquartered in Pasig, Chikka Philippines powers other services for mobile instant messaging and email accessible via SMS, mobile payment systems utilizing airtime credits, Free-Reply SMS as an option for prepaid mobile subscribers in need of ""top-up,"" mobile-enabled auctions, matchmaking and social networking as well as text, voice and visual mobile content.
The company’s services are currently available to over 45 mobile carriers in fourteen countries including the Philippines, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


== Etymology ==
Pronounced as it is spelled, Chikka (\’CHI-ka\, derived from chika) is a colloquial Filipino term for '""small talk"" or ""chatter"". As a verb, it translates to mingling easily, or doing anything with ease or in a clever manner. For Chikka, ""small talk"" refers to the nature of the many text and chat messages exchanged throughout online and mobile communities worldwide.


== History ==
Chikka Philippines, Incorporated, founded in 2000 by Chito Bustamante, Dennis Mendiola, and Alexandra Roxas, is headquartered in Pasig. It operates as a subsidiary of Chikka Holdings, Ltd. The owners of the company wanted to devise a customer service application that would connect Internet-to-mobile communities.
In 1999, Chikka began developing Chikka Text Messenger, which combines the features of instant messaging and SMS technology all available and accessible on a regular mobile phone. This application was originally intended for small e-commerce businesses that catered to the Filipino diaspora for the delivery of goods to the Philippines. It was designed to withstand SMS volume in a country sending 30 million messages daily, which made it ""Text Capital of the World"" in 2000.
Chikka was founded as a .com during the tail-end of the dot-com bubble in 2000. A year later, Chikka Messenger was launched. Chikka beat world players in creating an effective mobile instant messaging application, one that would marry SMS. Chikka’s solution and subsequent hold on the market was such that prevented many more global players from gaining ground in the ""SMS Capital.""
The Chikka Text Messenger (CTM) was capable of translating instant messaging functionalities such as presence detection (knowing which users are online), into SMS-enabled mobile phones. Effective anti-spam and privacy features were also built-in to assure primary customers in the network operators. Users would log-on to Chikka using their mobile phone number and enjoy free instant messaging from a PC and continue to receive messages on their mobiles even when offline.
Such features are the subject of patent filings worldwide.
By the third quarter of 2002, Chikka Asia, Inc. had already launched multiple services that allowed it to seize market leadership in the local Value Added Service (VAS) SMS market in the Philippines, especially on various corporate promo applications and SMS-based games.
In 2008, CEO Dennis Mendiola handed down CEO duties to Chito Bustamante, so as to focus on Product Development as Chikka's new Chief Imagination Officer. The company began taking steps towards an IPO or some other liquidity event for its investors. Apparent shareholder strife was revealed, when the raw findings by external auditor SGV, the Philippine partner of Ernst & Young of unliquidated cash advances by management of Chikka were leaked to Philippines media via a malicious ""white paper"" carrying the rumor.
Vindication for Chikka's Management ultimately came in 2009 when leading Philippine Telecommunications Smart Communications wholly acquired the company, keeping management intact to the present, with Chito Bustamante as CEO and Dennis Mendiola as de facto head of Product Development, even as he was appointed Chief Web and Internet adviser to Smart's Wireless Consumer Division.


== Chikka Text Messenger ==
Chikka Text Messenger is the first instant messaging desktop client to support communication with mobile phones via SMS that allows users to send free SMS messages to other users. Users who register their mobile numbers can also receive messages on their phones whenever offline. Other platforms and devices where Chikka is available are:
Web Messenger
Facebook App
Google Chrome Extension via Chrome Web Store
iOS via iOS App Store
Android via Google Play Store


== Affiliates ==
As Chikka introduced Chikka Text Messenger in 2001, its affiliates launched other pioneering services based on shared patents, technologies and resources. Patented technologies have allowed these affiliated entities to create mobile versions of popular Internet models, specifically online auctions and dating.


=== Bidshot.com ===
Bidshot Wireless Services is an online auction site that has also patented mobile-enabled auctions with actionable SMS alerts, wireless item message boards and location-based classifieds.
In 2002, Chikka acquired Bidshot Wireless Services, Inc.
In the same year, patented technologies allowed Bidshot to successively launch interactive television, mobile-enabled games and polls, SMS marketing promos and made an entry into mobile content. Bidshot today has over 100,000 registered users.

== Chikka International ==
In 2003, Chikka entered into franchising agreements with partners in Thailand and in Indonesia that brought its services to major network operators in those countries. It went on to break records for daily VAS SMS volume generated by existing providers, quickly establishing Chikka as a major content provider in these markets.
Subsequently, Chikka also signed up with carriers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan for messaging and celebrity-texting services catering to the overseas Filipino community.
In 2005, the Chikka Messenger connected to major US carriers Cingular Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and AT&T Wireless, the top three mobile network operators in the United States. Together with Sprint, Alltel and other carriers today, Chikka gained connectivity to 100% of US mobile subscribers.
In 2005, a partnership with Times Internet Ltd. (TIL), the new media arm of India's illustrious media conglomerate BCCL, launched the Chikka Messenger to all major operators, to cover 90% of mobile subscribers in India.
To provide extensive support to more international partners, Chikka obtained triple ISO certifications for Quality Management, Security and IT Project Management in 2005. Chikka's global headquarters in Pasig is the first Philippine-based company to obtain the triple certifications ISO 9001, BS 7799, and BS 15000.
In February 2006, the company acquired a CMMI Maturity Level 5, the highest level of certification for processes of I.T. organizations. A CMMI Maturity Level 5 certification puts Chikka along the ranks of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Intel Corporation, and Nokia; all of whom benchmark their processes with CMMI’s Maturity Level 5.
The first quarter of 2007 saw the launch of Chikka Messenger in the United Kingdom for all major mobile carriers, making the service available to over 70 million mobile subscribers.

244,"Norma Marie Talmadge (May 2, 1894 – December 24, 1957) was an American actress and film producer of the silent era. A major box-office draw for more than a decade, her career reached a peak in the early 1920s, when she ranked among the most popular idols of the American screen.
A specialist in melodrama, her most famous film was Smilin’ Through (1922), but she also scored artistic triumphs teamed with director Frank Borzage in Secrets (1924) and The Lady (1925). Her younger sister Constance Talmadge was also a movie star. Talmadge married millionaire film producer Joseph Schenck and they successfully created their own production company. After reaching fame in the film studios on the East Coast, she moved to Hollywood in 1922.
Talmadge was one of the most elegant and glamorous film stars of the Roaring '20s. However, by the end of the silent film era, her popularity with audiences had waned. After her two talkies proved disappointing at the box office, she retired a very wealthy woman.


== Early life ==
According to her birth certificate, Talmadge was born on May 2, 1894, in Jersey City, New Jersey. Although it has been widely reported she was born in Niagara Falls, New York, after achieving stardom, she admitted that her mother and she provided the more scenic setting of Niagara Falls to fan magazines to be more romantic. Talmadge was the eldest daughter of Fred Talmadge, an unemployed chronic alcoholic, and Margaret ""Peg"" Talmadge, a witty and indomitable woman. She had two younger sisters, Natalie and Constance, both of whom also became actresses.
The girls' childhoods were marked by poverty. One Christmas morning, Fred Talmadge left the house to buy food, and never came back, leaving his wife to raise their three daughters. Peg took in laundry, sold cosmetics, taught painting classes, and rented out rooms, raising her daughters in Brooklyn, New York.
After telling her mother about a classmate from Erasmus Hall High School who modeled for popular illustrated song slides (which were often shown before the one-reeler in movie theaters so the audience could sing along), Mrs. Talmadge decided to locate the photographer. She arranged an interview for her daughter, who after an initial rejection, was soon hired. When they went to the theater to see her debut, Peg resolved to get her into motion pictures.


== Career ==


=== Early films ===

Norma Talmadge was the eldest of the three daughters and the first pushed by their mother to look for a career as a film actress. Mother and daughter traveled to the Vitagraph Studios in Flatbush, New York, just a streetcar ride from her home. They managed to get past the studio gates and in to see the casting director, who promptly threw them out. However, scenario editor Beta Breuil, attracted by Talmadge's beauty, arranged a small part for her as a young girl who is kissed under a photographer's cloth in The Household Pest (1909).
Thanks to Breuill's continued patronage, between 1911 and 1912, Talmadge played bit parts in over 100 films. She eventually earned a spot in the stock company at $25 per week and got a steady stream of work. Her first role as a contract actress was 1911's Neighboring Kingdom, with comedian John Bunny. Her first real success came with the first original screen version of A Tale of Two Cities (1911), a three-hour epic released in weekly one-reel segments, in which she played the small role of Mimi, a seamstress who accompanies Sidney Carton to the guillotine. With help from the studio's major star, Maurice Costello, the star of A Tale of Two Cities, Talmadge's acting improved and she continued to play roles from leads to extras, gaining experience and public exposure in a variety of characters—from a colored mammy to a clumsy waitress to a reckless young modern, she began attracting both public and critical notice. By 1913, she was Vitagraph's most promising young actress. That same year, she was assigned to Van Dyke Brooke's acting unit, and throughout 1913 and 1914, appeared in more films, frequently with Antonio Moreno as her leading man.
In 1915, Talmadge got her big break, starring in Vitagraph’s prestigious feature film The Battle Cry of Peace, an anti-German propagandist drama, but ambitious Peg saw that her daughter's potential could carry them further, and got a two-year contract with National Pictures Company for eight features at $400 per week. Talmadge's last film for Vitagraph was The Crown Prince's Double. In the summer of 1915, she left Vitagraph. In the five years she had been with Vitagraph, she made over 250 films.
In August, the Talmadges left for California, where Norma's first role was in Captivating Mary Carstairs. The whole enterprise was a fiasco; the sets and costumes were cheap and the studio itself lacked adequate backing. The film was a flop, and the small new studio shut down after the release of Mary Carstairs. The demise of National Pictures Company left the family stranded in California after only one picture. Deciding it was smarter to aim high, they went to the Triangle Film Corporation, where D.W. Griffith was supervising productions. On the strength of The Battle Cry, Talmadge got a contract with Griffith's Fine Arts Company. For eight months, she starred in seven features for Triangle, including the comedy The Social Secretary (1916), a comedy written by Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson, that gave her an opportunity to disguise her beauty as a girl trying to avoid the unwelcome attentions of her male employers.


=== Norma Talmadge Film Corporation ===

When the contract ran out, the Talmadges returned to New York. At a party, Talmadge met Broadway and film producer Joseph M. Schenck, a wealthy exhibitor who wanted to produce his own films. Immediately taken by Talmadge both personally and professionally, Schenck proposed marriage and a production studio. Two months later, on October 20, 1916, they were married. Talmadge called her much older husband ""Daddy"". He supervised, controlled, and nurtured her career in alliance with her mother.
In 1917, the couple formed the Norma Talmadge Film Corporation, which became a lucrative enterprise. Schenck vowed he would make his wife the greatest star of all, and one to be remembered always. The best stories, most opulent costumes, grandest sets, talented casts, and distinguished directors, along with spectacular publicity, would be hers. Before long, women around the world wanted to be the romantic Norma Talmadge and flocked to her extravagant movies filmed on the East Coast.
Schenck soon had a stable of stars operating in his studio in New York, with the Norma Talmadge Film Corporation making dramas on the ground floor, the Constance Talmadge Film Corporation making sophisticated comedies on the second floor, and the comic unit with Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle on the top floor, with Natalie Talmadge acting as secretary and taking occasional small roles in her sisters' films. Arbuckle brought in his nephew Al St. John and vaudeville star Buster Keaton. When Schenck decided it was financially advantageous to rent Arbuckle to Paramount Pictures for feature films, Keaton took over the comedy unit and soon married Natalie, bringing him more thoroughly into the Talmadge family fold, at least for a time.
Talmadge's first film for her studio, the now lost Panthea, (1917) was directed by Allan Dwan with assistants Erich von Stroheim and Arthur Rosson. The film was a dramatic tour de force for her in a story set in Russia of a woman who sacrifices herself to help her husband. The film was a hit, turning Talmadge into a sensation and established her as a first-rate dramatic actress.
Talmadge’s acting ability improved rapidly during this period. She made four to six films a year in New York between 1917 and 1921. Under Schenck's personal supervision, other films followed, including Poppy (1917), in which, she was paired with Eugene O'Brien. The teaming was such a hit, they made 10 more films together, including The Moth, and The Secret of the Storm Country, a sequel to Tess of the Storm Country (1914), starring Mary Pickford.
In 1918, she reteamed with Sidney Franklin, who directed The Safety Curtain, Her Only Way, Forbidden City, The Heart of Wetona, and 1919's The Probation Wife. These films have small-scale settings and familiar actors appearing from one film to the next. An advantage of the East Coast locale was access to the country's best high-fashion designers, such as Madame Francis and Lucile. Between 1919 and 1920, Talmadge's name appeared on a regular monthly fashion advice column for Photoplay magazine; her publicist was Beulah Livingstone.


=== Hollywood films ===
Throughout the 1920s, Talmadge continued to triumph in films such as 1920's Yes or No, The Branded Woman, Passion Flower (1921), and The Sign on the Door (1921). The next year, she had the most popular film of her entire career, Smilin' Through (1922) directed by Sidney Franklin. One of the greatest screen romances of the silent film era, it was remade twice, in 1932 with Norma Shearer, and in 1941 with Jeanette MacDonald.
After Smilin' Through, Schenck closed the New York studios and Norma and Constance moved to Hollywood to join Keaton and Natalie. Talmadge's Hollywood films were different from her New York films. Bigger and glossier, they were fewer but more varied, often with period or exotic settings. She teamed with cinematographer Tony Gaudio and some of Hollywood's finest costume designers for a more glamorous image. She also worked with top-flight directors such as Frank Lloyd, Clarence Brown, and Frank Borzage. With help from films directed by her first husband Joseph M. Schenck, she became one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1920s.
In 1923, a poll of picture exhibitors named Norma Talmadge the number-one box office star. She was earning $10,000 a week, and receiving as many as 3,000 letters weekly from her fans. Her film Secrets (1924), directed by Frank Borzage, marked the pinnacle of her career, with her giving her best performance and receiving the best reviews. In 1924, Schenck had moved over to head United Artists, but Talmadge still had a distribution contract with First National. She continued to make successful films such as The Lady (1925) directed by Frank Borzage and the romantic comedy Kiki (1926) directed by Clarence Brown, remade later by Mary Pickford as a sound film in 1931.
One of the at least nine theories of the origin of the tradition for celebrities to stamp a hand in Hollywood involves Talmadge. According to it, in 1927, she accidentally stepped into wet concrete in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.


=== Decline ===

Talmadge's last film for First National was Camille (1926), an adaptation of an Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'' novel later remade by Greta Garbo. During filming, Talmadge fell in love with leading man Gilbert Roland. She asked Schenck for a divorce, but he was not ready to grant it. Despite his personal feelings, he was not going to break up a moneymaking team and continued casting Roland in Talmadge's next three films released by United Artists. Talmadge and Schenck separated, though he continued producing her films. He was now president of the prestigious but theater-poor United Artists Corporation, and the rest of Talmadge's films were released for that company. UA’s distribution problems, however, began to erode her popularity. Her first films for this studio, The Dove (1927) and The Woman Disputed (1928), were box-office failures and ended up being her last silent movies.
By the time Woman Disputed (1928) was released, the talking film revolution had begun, and Talmadge began taking voice lessons in preparation. She worked diligently with voice coaches for over a year so she could make her sound debut. Her first talkie, New York Nights (1929), showed that she could speak and act acceptably in talkies. While her performance was considered to be good, the film was not. Talmadge next took on the role of Madame du Barry in the 1930 film Du Barry, Woman of Passion. With incompetent direction and Talmadge's inexperience at a role requiring very demanding vocal acting, the film was a failure, in spite of the elaborate sets by William Cameron Menzies.
On March 29, 1929, at the bungalow of Mary Pickford, United Artists brought together Talmadge, Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, Dolores del Río, and D.W. Griffith to speak on the radio show The Dodge Brothers Hour to prove that Griffith could meet the challenge of talking movies.
Talmadge's sister Constance sent her a telegram with this advice: ""Quit pressing your luck, baby. The critics can't knock those trust funds Mama set up for us"". As time passed, it became increasingly clear that the public was no longer interested in its old favorites, and Talmadge was seen as an icon of the past. Talmadge had been increasingly bored with filmmaking before the talkie challenge came along, and this setback seems to have discouraged her from further attempts.
She still had two more films left on her United Artists contract. In late 1930, Samuel Goldwyn announced he had bought the film rights to Zoë Akins' comedy play The Greeks Had a Word for It for her. She reportedly did some stage rehearsals for it in New York, but within a few months, she asked to be released from her contract. She never again appeared on screen. (Goldwyn eventually made the film version of The Greeks Had a Word for It under the title The Greeks Had a Word for Them in 1932.)


== Retirement ==
Upon leaving the movie world, Norma Talmadge rid herself of all the duties and responsibilities of stardom. She told eager fans who were pressing her for an autograph as she left a restaurant, ""Get away, dears. I don't need you anymore and you don't need me.""
Some time before late 1932, Talmadge decided against marrying Gilbert Roland, as he was 11 years her junior and she feared he would eventually leave her. Mother Peg fell ill in 1931, and died in September 1933. In late 1932, Talmadge began seeing her ex-husband Joseph Schenck's poker friend, comedian George Jessel. In April 1934, Schenck, from whom she had been separated for seven years, finally granted Talmadge her divorce, and nine days later, she married Jessel. Schenck continued to do what he could for Norma and her sisters, acting as a financial adviser and guiding her business affairs.
Talmadge's last professional works consisted of appearances on Jessel's radio program, which was sagging in the ratings. The program soon ended, and the marriage did not last; the couple divorced in 1939. Schenck's business acumen and her mother's watchful ambition for her daughters had resulted in a huge fortune for Talmadge, and she never wanted for money. Restless since the end of her filmmaking days, Talmadge traveled, often shuttling between her houses, entertaining, and visiting with her sisters. In 1946, she married Dr. Carvel James, a Beverly Hills physician.


== Later years and death ==

In her later years, Talmadge, who had never been comfortable with the burdens of public celebrity, became reclusive. Increasingly crippled by painful arthritis and reported to be dependent on painkilling drugs, she moved to the warm climate of Las Vegas for her final years. According to Anita Loos' memories of Talmadge, the drug addiction came first which caused arthritis and was the basis of Norma's interest in her physician husband . In 1956, she was voted by her peers as one of the top five female stars of the pre-1925 era, but was too ill to travel to Rochester, New York, to accept her award.
After suffering a series of strokes in 1957, Talmadge died of pneumonia on Christmas Eve of that year. At the time of her death, her estate was valued at more than US$1,000,000 (roughly $8,000,000 in 2012). She is interred with Constance and Natalie in their own niche in the Abbey of the Psalms in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Norma Talmadge has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street.


== In popular culture ==
A New York Times article from March 14, 2010, says that Talmadge

is misremembered, having inspired two unfair caricatures that have lived on in a pair of popular films. In Singin' in the Rain (1952), she is parodied as Lina Lamont ... More malignantly, Billy Wilder used Norma Talmadge as the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen of his 1950 film Sunset Boulevard.

However, neither of these identifications is in the mainstream of critical opinion. Nearly all other writers regard both Norma Desmond and Lina Lamont as fictional composite characters, each mirroring some aspects of various faded silent stars, but neither of them primarily a disguised portrait of anyone in particular. Lina Lamont bears little resemblance to Talmadge's personality either on or off the screen, and unlike the delusional Desmond, Talmadge was not stuck in the past and had left her stardom behind her with considerable relief.
Talmadge is referenced by name in Woody Allen's film Sweet and Lowdown (1999), in which the Hattie character, played by Samantha Morton, is cast in a silent film as her younger sister, and described by one character as, ""...a dead ringer for May Talmadge.""
In the movie of William Inge's play of the same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's character Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, ""Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?"" Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, ""Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope tell you what to do with the rest of your life."" She ""gets even"" with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, ""I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me.""

245,"Gloxinia perennis is a species of tropical rhizomatous herbaceous flowering plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is sometimes known as ""Canterbury bells"" (not to be confused with members of the genus Campanula, which go by the same name).


== Etymology ==
The genus name commemorate Benjamin Peter Gloxin (1765-1795), a German physician and botanical writer. The Latin species name «perennis», meaning «perennial», was meant to distinguish it from the annual Martynia annua, as it was first placed in the genus Martynia.


== Description ==
Gloxinia perennis has a raceme-like flowering stem. The flowers are showy, bell-shaped, nodding, pale purple or violet-lavender, mint-scented, about 4 cm long. The stem is erect, glabrous and reaches a height of about 60–120 cm. The leaves are opposite, glabrous and veined. The flowering period extended from mid Summer until early Fall. Fruits are ovoid to elliptical capsules, containing numerous minute seeds. This plant has scaly underground rhizomes.


== Distribution ==
This species has a wide range in Central and South America, from Costa Rica up to Colombia, Brazil and Peru. It is primarily found in the Andes of South America, while it has probably escaped from cultivation in Central America and the West Indies. Its original range is unknown.


== Habitat ==
Gloxinia perennis prefers shady and humid places and grows in forests, on rocks and river banks.

246,"Lamian is a type of Chinese noodle. Lamian is made by twisting, stretching and folding the dough into strands, using the weight of the dough. The length and thickness of the strands depends on the number of times the dough is folded. This unique method of making noodles originated in China. The Songshi Yangsheng Bu (simplified Chinese: 宋氏养生部; traditional Chinese: 宋氏養生部), which was written by Song Xu and dates back to 1504, has the earliest description of the method to make lamian.


== Description ==

The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce many strands of thin, long noodle. Literally, lā, (拉) means to pull or stretch, while miàn (simplified: 面/traditional: 麵) means noodle.
There are several styles of twisting the dough but they all employ the same concept: a piece of dough is repeatedly stretched and folded onto itself in order to align the glutens and warm up the dough for stretching. Then it is rolled out to a workable thickness and cut into workable portions. The end pieces of the starting dough are never used because the glutens are not as aligned as the middle pieces.
This dough is then pulled to about an arm span's length. The puller then makes a loop with the dough, joining the two ends into one clump of dough, and inserts his fingers into the loop to keep the strand from sticking to itself. Doing this, the pull has doubled the length of the dough while fractioning its thickness. This process is repeated several times until the desired thickness and quantity is achieved. Some pullers dip the strands into flour between stretching phases to keep them separated. When flour is used, there generally is a final slap of noodles against the prep board to remove excess flour.
In the Lanzhou style, the dough is worked aggressively. It is pulled in straight, quick, tugs with no twisting or waving. Some pullers regularly slam the noodle against their prep boards to ensure even stretching and uniform thickness. Flour is sometimes used to dust the strands and prevent sticking.
In the Beijing style of preparation, the dough is twisted, stretched delicately by waving the arms and body, untwisted, looped to double the strands, and then repeated. When stretching, they coordinate waving their torso and arms to increase the potential length of the noodle beyond that of the puller's arm span. Flour dusting is more liberally employed in this style than in the Lanzhou style of preparation.
There is also another style, in which the noodle maker stretches one thick, flat strand of dough between two hands. This is usually done for show and involves the puller twirling and spinning much like Chinese ribbon dancing.


== Use in dishes ==
Dishes using lamian are usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup called tāngmiàn (simplified Chinese: 汤面; traditional Chinese: 湯麵; pinyin: Tāngmiàn literally 'soup noodles'), but sometimes stir-fried and served with a sauce, this dish being called chǎomiàn (simplified Chinese: 炒面; traditional Chinese: 炒麵; pinyin: Chǎomiàn, literally 'fried noodles.' This word is etymologically related to chow mein though the dish itself is different).


== Region ==


=== China ===

Small restaurants serving Lanzhou-style lamian are very common throughout western China where they have formed a staple diet for centuries, as well as eastern Chinese cities. They tend to serve a variety of low cost meals, with a choice of lamian, daoxiaomian (simplified Chinese: 刀削面; traditional Chinese: 刀削麵; pinyin: Dāoxiāomiàn; literally: ""knife-sliced noodles"") and perhaps Xi'an-style paomo (steamed bread dipped in soup). Noodles may be served with beef or mutton, either in soup or stir-fried. Lamian can also be served cold with salad ingredients such as shredded cucumber and tomato to make a refreshing summer dish.
Many of the lamian restaurants are owned by Hui ethnic families from Northwestern China, and serve only halal food (thus no pork dishes). Lamian restaurants are the most common halal restaurants in eastern China.
Another typical variety of lamian is Shandong lamian, from the eastern province of Shandong.


=== Singapore ===
Singapore sports 'lamian' restaurants, however the taste may be alien to those accustomed to Chinese lanzhou lamian, as the ingredients are often altered to suit local tastes which are distinctly south-eastern Chinese. There are nevertheless lamian restaurants in Singapore serving tastes similar if not identical to lanzhou lamian, particularly if run by Chinese migrants.


=== United States ===
In New York's Manhattan and Sunset Park Chinatowns, lamian restaurants are a common sight. Most are run by Fuzhounese, some featuring knife cut noodles, but most featuring only the hand-cut versions. Some call themselves ""Lanzhou Lamian"" restaurants, others are just called ""Lamian"" restaurants. In Manhattan Chinatown, most are located in the Fuzhounese area of Chinatown east of Bowery, while in Sunset Park, sometime referred to as Fuzhou Town, they are scattered along the 8th Avenue strip. In the Brighton Beach, Brooklyn neighborhood and in the Little Bukhara area of Queens it is common to find Laghman noodles available in Uzbek and Uighur restaurants.


=== Australia ===
Lamian restaurants are increasingly found in Australia's chinatowns and beyond. Most are run by non-Hui, non-Muslim Chinese migrants from mainland China and therefore differ from the typical Muslim 'lamian' restaurants in China, as the meat will not be halal and ingredients such as pork are offered. Whilst in China lamian restaurants are typically cheap in comparison to other local food, in Australia the price of lamian restaurant meals is on par with other Chinese and local food varieties. Whilst in China lamian restaurants are advertised as 'Lanzhou' lamian, regardless of whether the recipes and staff are from Lanzhou, in Australia one finds non-Lanzhou lamian advertised, such as Xi'an lamian and Xinjiang lamian.


=== Philippines ===
Manila, Cebu and Davao's Chinatowns have respectively Chinese restaurants serving lamian. Additionally, the Filipino version of noodles, locally called Pancit Canton, is a popular Filipino dish.

248,"Naval Offices is a heritage-listed office building at 3 Edward Street, Brisbane City, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Department of Public Works and built from 1900 to 1901 by J Mason. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 March 2013.


== History ==

The brick former Naval Offices at 3 Edward Street in Brisbane was constructed in 1900–01 by the Queensland Department of Public Works as the first purpose-built headquarters for naval forces in Queensland. Built for the Queensland Marine Defence Force (QMDF), it was soon used by the Australian Commonwealth Navy (ACN). It was transferred to Commonwealth ownership in 1911 and was used by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
The former Naval Offices is located midway along the Town Reach (Petrie Bight to Gardens Point) of the Brisbane River, within a block bounded by Margaret, Edward and Alice streets and the river. Over time this area was used by a number of Queensland Government entities dedicated to commercial shipping, including: the Government Shipping Office, Port Office, Marine Board Office, Harbours and Rivers Department, Hydraulic Engineers and Shipping Master's departments, Marine Department and the Government Seamen's Saving Bank. A Reserve for the Harbour Master's Department of 1 rood and 30 perches (1,771 square metres) was surveyed in 1862 between the corner of Alice and Edward streets and the river, and a stone and brick building was erected that year. Later known as the (first) Port Office, it included offices on the ground floor and store rooms and a boatshed underneath. Prior to this date the Harbour Master was based in George Street.
Military use of the immediate area started c.1886, when the QMDF occupied the 1862 Port Office. The QMDF was created in 1885 in response to fears that Queensland's coastal settlements were vulnerable to Russian warships. In the late 1870s tensions between Britain and Russia had raised concerns regarding the defence of Britain's overseas colonies. Colonel Sir William Jervois of the Royal Engineers, assisted by Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Scratchley, toured the Australian colonies to make recommendations for defence arrangements and the pair visited Queensland in August 1877. To deal with the perceived Russian naval threat to Brisbane they recommended using small naval vessels to disrupt enemy landings, a coastal fort with submarine mines across the river at Lytton, and a mobile field force of infantry and engineers with artillery. A Naval Brigade and a Torpedo Corps was also required. When the Defence Act 1884 was gazetted on 25 February 1885, the existing Queensland Volunteer Force (land forces) became the Queensland Defence Force (QDF). The Queensland Defence (Marine) Force was gazetted on 3 March 1885.
Lieutenant Walton Drake had taken command of the Naval Brigade from 1 January 1885, tasked with training volunteers. Two 50-strong companies of Brisbane naval volunteers were announced that month and additional naval brigades were later formed at other Queensland ports, including Townsville, Rockhampton, Maryborough, Cairns, Cooktown, Bundaberg, Thursday Island and Mackay.
Naval vessels were also ordered as part of the proposed plan to defend Queensland. The first vessel of Queensland's new navy to be delivered was the steel, second-class spar torpedo boat ""Mosquito"", which arrived as deck cargo in Brisbane in October 1884. Prior to this the closest thing that Queensland had to a naval vessel was the Queensland Government schooner ""Pearl"", which conducted survey work and guarded the pearling fisheries in northern Queensland waters.
The main strength of the QMDF, the sister Alpha class gunboats ""Gayundah"" (meaning Thunder) and ""Paluma"" (Lightning), ordered from Britain in 1883 and launched in 1884, arrived in March 1885 and May 1885 respectively.
The ""Gayundah"" sailed to Queensland under Commander (later Captain) Henry Townley Wright, a retired Royal Navy officer. Wright was appointed as Senior Naval Officer (SNO) and Superintendent of the QMDF on 30 March 1885, as well as remaining in command of the ""Gayundah"". Those of the crew who elected to remain in Queensland's service became the first permanent members of the QMDF. The ""Gayundah"" was used to train QMDF seamen, while the ""Paluma"" was used on survey work by the British Admiralty until being handed back to Queensland in 1895. The last regular vessel of the QMDF was the ""Midge"", a mahogany timber picquet boat/spar torpedo boat, which arrived in 1888.
Auxiliary vessels in the QMDF included a locally-built steamer ""Miner"", and the government steamer ""Otter"". Five steam hopper barges of the Harbours and Rivers Department (Queensland Maritime Defence Force Auxiliary Gunboats), the ""Bonito"", ""Stingaree"", ""Dolphin"", ""Bream"" and ""Pumba"", could also be armed if required for port defence.
A Permanent Force, HMQS Gayundah, QDF (Marine), was established in February 1892, but most of its full-time crew were paid off in 1893 as part of cutbacks during the 1890s depression, as was the 'Paluma's' crew after the ship had completed its survey work. For most of the 1890s the gunboats were used by naval brigade crews solely for training.
In and near Brisbane, a number of buildings were erected for the QMDF. The Naval Stores (Naval Stores, Kangaroo Point) and a wharf were built at the base of the Kangaroo Point cliffs in 1886–87, across the river from the QMDF headquarters on Edward Street. A sub-marine mining (naval mine) store was erected c.1886 at Fort Lytton (Fort Lytton National Park), and a sub-marine mining drill hall was later built at the west end of Alice Street in 1900.
By 1896, the old Port Office used by the QMDF was in a poor state and the foundations, inundated during the 1893 floods, were settling and causing wall cracks. On 1 August 1899 the QMDF's Staff Paymaster, Edward Vincent Pollock, also complained that the roof was leaking water onto his paperwork. Later that month £1500 was allocated by the Department of Public Works for the construction of new offices.
In May 1900 it was decided by Queensland's new Naval Commandant, Captain William Rooke Creswell, that the new offices would replace the cottage of the Marine Department's messenger/caretaker at the corner of Edward and Alice Streets. Tenders were invited in late August and the cottage was demolished.
Plans for the new Naval Offices were approved by AB Brady, the Government Architect within the Department of Public Works (DPW), on 14 September 1900, but since he was trained as an engineer it is unlikely to be his design. The DPW employed a number of accomplished architects at this time and the work could be attributed to Thomas Pye (First Assistant Architect from July 1899), John Smith Murdoch (Second Assistant Architect from 1 July 1899), or George David Payne (Temporary Draughtsman 1898–1901). Pye supervised larger works, while Murdoch took charge of the designing and drafting staff.
The Department of Public Works was involved in the design and construction of Queensland's most important buildings and capital works following its formation in 1866. Employing a succession of highly talented architects, the Department produced many fine buildings of high architectural merit. Prior to World War II these buildings were characterised by: highly-functional, rational plan arrangements that were commodious and accommodating; use of high- quality, durable materials, preferably sourced from Queensland; and a quality of civic dignity brought about through style, scaling, and form.
The tender of James Mason of Brisbane of £1845/17/6 for the Brisbane Naval Offices was accepted in October 1900, and the building was completed by late June 1901. ""The Queenslander"" reported on 16 November 1901 that the building's facing bricks were dark-brown, relieved with cement dressings and rough-cast work. The roof was covered with rolled galvanised iron. The Annual Report for DPW to 30 June 1901 (where the Naval Offices was listed under principal works completed during the year) mentioned internal fittings of pine and cedar. No other Australian colony built naval offices in this period, just prior to Federation and the transfer of defence assets. Queensland may have done so to ensure the continued use of Brisbane by the Commonwealth Navy.
As a naval headquarters, the building was designed with spaces for the senior naval officers and their administrative staff, along with a strong room for the Staff Paymaster. The original ground floor plan included an entry porch off Edward Street, with double doors leading north-west into a public space which was separated by a counter from the Clerk's office. There was also a set of double doors leading north-east into a vestibule between the front offices, and onwards into a central hall. To the rear of the Clerk's Office was the Paymaster's Office, which included a projecting strong room at the rear of the building. The right front (southern) office was for the Commandant, while the right rear (eastern) office was for the Officer of the Naval Corps. Each had a fireplace.
Behind the Naval Corp's office was the separate Brigade Entrance. From this entrance the ground floor rear verandah could be accessed, as well as a stairway up to a landing from which people could either descend to the ground floor offices, or continue up to the first floor. The latter was a large open space used as an Orderly (Administrative) Room, with four fireplaces and a small lavatory and store at the right rear (eastern) corner. This space may have been later partitioned for sleeping quarters and offices. The 1900 plans do not show the ventilation fleche which was present on the roof when the building was finished. This fleche was removed by the mid 1980s, and was replicated in the 1990s.
Although the QMDF existed when the building was started, the first occupants were technically the Queensland components of a Commonwealth Navy. After the Australian Commonwealth was formed on 1 January 1901 the defence forces of the separate colonies were transferred to the new Federal Government in March. However, procedural delays meant arrangements were not completed until 1902.
At the time of Federation, Queensland's naval forces numbered 750 men of all ranks, and it was one of four states (including Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia) to contribute ships to the Australian Commonwealth Naval Force (ACNF), formed on 1 March 1901 – handing over the ""Gayundah"", ""Paluma"", ""Mosquito"" and ""Midge"". Captain Creswell remained the Commandant of the Queensland-based flotilla of the ACN. In late 1904 Captain Creswell was appointed Director of Commonwealth Naval Forces, and his place as Queensland Naval Commandant was taken by Captain Frederick Tickell (to 1907). By 1904, 49% of Australia's serving naval officers had served in the QMDF.
Captain Creswell was a major advocate for an independent Australian navy. Australia had been a separate British Naval Station since 1859 and a squadron of the Royal Navy was maintained in Australian waters until 1913. After March 1901 the Royal Navy was still paid to provide blue water defence (a force projection capability beyond coastal defence), but Captain Creswell lobbied for an autonomous Australian blue water navy. The 1909 Imperial Conference agreed to form an Australian fleet, and the first ships of this fleet, the destroyers ""Yarra"" and ""Parramatta"", reached Australia in 1910. On 10 July 1911 King George V granted the title ""Royal Australian Navy"" to the ACN and in October 1913 formal control of these units was transferred to the Commonwealth Naval Board. Meanwhile, in 1911 district naval officers were appointed around Australia to replace the naval commandants.
Although the Commonwealth took control of Queensland's naval forces in 1901, the Naval Offices was not transferred to Commonwealth ownership until 1911. The state Department of Public Works was still maintaining the building in 1910 and it was still in Queensland ownership in June 1911.
A number of alterations were made to the Naval Offices during Commonwealth ownership. February 1933 plans included the addition of a first floor rear verandah with an enclosed laundry and new stairs from the side yard. At the same time the first floor was converted into a residence for the Senior Naval Officer, and the large space was partitioned into domestic rooms. The internal stairway from the main ground floor hall was removed, so the upstairs residence could only be accessed from the old Brigade Entrance or the new rear verandah. Two sets of French doors plus a single door were installed between the verandah and the residence. A ""typiste"" (typists) room was added to the north-west end of the original ground floor rear verandah, and a new lavatory was added behind the strong room. Further additions in late 1939 resulted in a new office, lavatory and water closet (WC) being built behind the strong room, replacing the 1933 lavatory. Two other WCs were also built sometime between 1933 and 1939 on and adjacent to the rear verandah.
After Japan entered World War II in December 1941, Brisbane became an important supply and command centre and the resulting expansion of the Allied naval presence in the city meant larger Naval Staff Offices were urgently required. During 1942–43 commercial buildings in Queen Street were requisitioned and occupied by the Australian and United States navies. Although the Operational Staff of the RAN's Naval Officer in Charge (NOIC), Queensland, was based in Queen Street, the District Naval Officer, Queensland, remained at the Edward Street Naval Offices with the Civil Secretariat and Accounts staffs. Other wartime RAN facilities in Brisbane were located at Colmslie and New Farm. The Smellie and Co. warehouse (Old Mineral House) opposite the Naval Offices was used by the US Red Cross before becoming an Australian Comforts Fund hostel for the Royal Navy in 1945.
Further alterations were made to accommodate the extra staff at the Naval Offices. In 1944 a two-storey timber office extension was added behind the existing verandahs, the verandahs were enclosed as offices, and toilet arrangements were reconfigured. The stairway to the first floor 1933 verandah was removed, as was the first floor verandah laundry. The original steps up to the rear yard from Alice Street were removed and replaced with steps that climbed south-west to the side yard.
By 1977 the former Naval Offices was vacant, its functions having been transferred to HMAS Moreton at New Farm (naval base, closed 1994). The Edward Street site was surplus to Commonwealth requirements but, as it was included on the Register of the National Estate by this time, a decision was made to lease the property for 99 years rather than sell it. This enabled conditions protecting the heritage values of the original section of the former Naval Offices to be written into the lease. The building was leased to Jakuma Limited in November 1981. The lease was transferred to Historic Holdings Pty Ltd in 1987, and to HSH Hotels (Australia) Limited in 2000.
From 1982 the former Naval Offices was used as Muddies Seafood Restaurant, and alterations were made including removing walls between the ground floor offices, constructing a new stair in the ground floor hall, removing internal partitions in the rear timber extensions on both levels, a new kitchen fit-out on the first floor, and adding a fire escape stair to the rear.
After the restaurant closed in 1989, the building was vacant for a period before being refurbished in the early 1990s. This refurbishment was designed by Bruce Buchanan Architects and saw the restoration of lost or obscured significant fabric. The 1944 office extensions to the rear of the building were demolished and the rear verandah was reconstructed. The ground floor toilets were upgraded, partitions were reinstated between the offices on the ground floor, and the first floor partitions were removed to make one large space. At some time after this work the first floor was again partitioned into rooms although these walls do not reach the ceiling. A new kitchenette was built at the rear eastern corner of the first floor.
Behind the former Naval Offices, the Stamford Hotel, a large multi-storey building, was constructed in 1990 and a boardwalk was built behind the former Naval Offices along the river edge. However, a visual connection between the former Naval Offices and the river was maintained. The flagpole at the front of the building is not an original feature, but was there by World War II; while the four flagpoles located near the rear northern corner of the building date from between 1974 and 1991. The building was returned to Queensland State Government ownership in 2011, and in 2012 the ground floor was occupied by a florist, while an architectural firm and a property developer sub-leased the first floor.


== Description ==

The former Naval Offices is a two-storey brick building on the corner of Edward and Alice streets, Brisbane, adjacent to and overlooking the Brisbane River. The building occupies the majority of the allotment with a small yard behind. Primary entrance is from Edward Street with a secondary entrance from the Alice Street road reserve.
The building is of load-bearing brick construction with timber floor and roof structure. A two-storey timber verandah at the rear overlooks the yard to the river and is not of cultural heritage significance. The building elevations are face brick in English bond, with the upper level finished in stucco with face brick quoining to the corners and around windows. The bricks are deep red with contrasting pale grey tuck pointing. Windows are large and rectangular with brick lintels and timber-framed, double-hung sashes with slender, moulded-timber glazing bars. There is one circular window on the upper level of the Alice Street side closest to the river. The hipped roof overhangs the upper floor, has bracketed timber eaves and is clad with roll and pan metal sheet. There is a central metal octagonal ventilation fleche on the ridge and two tall chimneys flank the sides of the building.
The building is two-storey with an asymmetrical, single-storey projection to Edward Street accommodating the entry portico and former public reception area. The building is notable for its Arts and Crafts decorative treatments including: extensive use of high-quality, tuck pointed face brickwork and stucco; rendered dressings; tall decorative brickwork chimneys with chimney pots; decorative eaves brackets; a prominent semi-circular window flanked by horizontal bands of render; and rusticated Tuscan order columns and a curved pediment with a sculpted naval coat of arms to the portico.
A decorative wrought iron gate opens to the entry portico where the floor is finished with tessellated encaustic tiles with slate thresholds and the ceiling is v-jointed timber boards. There are two adjacent entry doors from the porch; both are timber double doors with leaded fanlights. The larger door opens into the hall via a small foyer and the smaller door into the front room which is divided into two parts by a large arched opening.
The ground floor plan is organised around a central stair hall running front to back with two main rooms on either side. The ground floor has vinyl-covered, timber floors; plaster walls; moulded timber skirtings, architraves and cornices; and v-jointed timber board ceilings with decorative timber fretwork vents. Floor-to-ceiling height on the ground floor is 3.6m. The main rooms have a fireplace each with a simple moulded plaster surround and mantle, and a decorative cast-iron firebox. The rear northern room has a strong room with a heavy iron door. The doors into the four rooms are varnished timber with moulded panels and rectangular glazed fanlights. The ground floor offices are numbered 1 to 4, and the interior double doors to the foyer carry the words ""Commonwealth of Australia Naval Office"" on the glass.
A large plaster royal coat of arms is positioned above the doors of the small entry foyer. The timber half-turn stair has a decorative timber balustrade and a small cleaner's cupboard with sink is underneath.
The rear verandah of the ground floor leads to male and female toilets (1991) that are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. A rear yard has an enclosure for mechanical equipment and a garden with trees and shrubs – the vegetation is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Four flagpoles are located at the northern rear corner of the building and are not of cultural heritage significance.

On the Alice Street side concrete stairs lead into a narrow side yard enclosed by a short, brick and timber fence. This yard wraps around the building along this side to meet the front porch on Edward Street. The Alice Street entrance door is timber v-jointed boards, ledged and braced, with a rectangular fanlight. The threshold is a single, large slate. This door opens to a small hall and stair up to the landing of the main stair which rises to the first floor. French doors open into the stair landing from the first floor rear verandah at a height above floor level, indicating a previous floor and stair configuration.
The first floor has carpet covered timber floors, plaster walls, simple timber skirtings and cornices, moulded timber architraves, and a ripple iron ceiling with metal ventilation panels. The floor is divided by timber partitions that are not full height. A layout of previous partitions is visible on the ceiling. There are four non- functional fireplaces without mantle or firebox. A rear room contains a kitchen. Timber-framed, glazed French doors and a clear-finished panelled timber door open onto the rear verandah from the rear rooms of the first floor.
The former Naval Offices is a small building within a streetscape of larger structures featuring other late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century masonry buildings including the former Port Office, Old Mineral House (Smellie & Co. warehouse), Smellie's Building, and the Port Office Hotel and is adjacent to the entrance gates of the City Botanic Gardens. The building is visible from the Brisbane River and there is a sight line from the former Naval Offices to the former Naval Stores at Kangaroo Point across the river.


== Heritage listing ==
The former Naval Offices was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 March 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The 1901 former Naval Offices, Brisbane, is important surviving evidence of the existence of the Queensland Marine Defence Force (QMDF, established 1885) and the later policy of basing Australian naval vessels in Queensland. Although the QMDF ceased to exist soon after the building was finished, it was used by the Australian Commonwealth Navy (ACN) and then the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) until the 1970s.
Constructed by the Queensland Government as the first purpose-built headquarters for naval forces in Queensland, the former Naval Offices illustrates the importance placed on the naval defence of Queensland at the time of Federation.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The intact and distinctive former Naval Offices is unique as the only naval headquarters building constructed by the Queensland government.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
The former Naval Offices is a fine example of the well-designed buildings constructed by the Queensland Department of Public Works. The building has a highly-functional, rational plan; is well constructed using high-quality, durable materials sourced from Queensland; and has a quality of civic dignity achieved through style, scaling, and form.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a naval office. In particular its internal layout illustrates its former naval administrative use, with a separate front entrance for the public and a side entrance for the Naval Brigade leading to the first floor, separate offices on the ground floor, and a strong room.
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
The former Naval Offices is important for its aesthetic significance through an accomplished use of Arts and Crafts decorative treatments. These include: an asymmetrical composition; extensive use of high-quality, tuck-pointed face brickwork and stucco; rendered dressings; tall chimneys with decorative chimney pots; decorative eaves with brackets; circular accents; contrasting earthy colours and textures; a conspicuous use of hand-crafted ornamentation; ornate decorative features of the portico including rusticated Tuscan order columns and a curved pediment with a sculpted naval coat of arms.
As a finely crafted, small-scale building, the former Naval Offices makes an important contribution to the streetscape of the Lower Edward Street precinct of late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings including the Port Office, Smellie & Co. warehouse (Old Mineral House), Smellie's Building and the Port Office Hotel; as well as the City Botanic Gardens.
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.
The former Naval Offices has a long-standing and important historical association with the naval forces of Queensland and Australia, being built for the QMDF before being used by the Queensland flotilla of the ACN, and later the RAN, between 1901 and the mid 1970s.

249,"Gnorismoneura serrata is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in China.
The wingspan is 14-16.5 mm for males and 18–19.5 mm for females. The ground color of the forewings is yellowish brown, scattered with some short strigulae (fine streaks) and black patterns. The hindwings are dark grey.


== Etymology ==
The specific name is derived from the Latin word serratus (meaning serrate or having tooth-like projections) and refers to the dorsally serrate aedeagus.

250,"Cirsonella naticoides is a species of very small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk or micromollusk in the family Skeneidae.


== Description ==
(Original description by Charles Hedley) The height of the shell attains 2.35 mm, its diameter 3 mm. This is a small, solid, cream-colored shell with a turbinate shape. The four rounded whorls contain no sculpture. The surface is smooth and polished, in contrast with most species in this genus which are cancellate. The umbilicus is deep and narrow, its margin a faint basal funicle. The aperture is entire circular, double-edged, on its right lower margin the low arched butt-end of the basal funicle, then a broad thick callus tongue. This is probably marking the termination of a second inner funicle, and reaching half-way across the umbilicus. Lastly there is a similar but smaller callus pad laid upon the preceding whorl. The double basal funicle is remarkable. The inner funicle is swallowed by the umbilicus and its presence is only indicated by the callus on the aperture. The outer funicle is unusually faint.


== Distribution ==
This marine species is endemic to Australia. It occurs off Victoria and in the Bass Strait.

253,"New Approach (foaled 18 February 2005) is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active stallion. In a racing career which lasted from July 2007 to October 2008 he ran eleven times and won eight races. He was undefeated in five races as a two-year-old in 2007 including the National Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. As a three-year-old he won the 2008 Epsom Derby, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Champion Stakes and was rated the best racehorse in the world (jointly with Curlin) in the 2008 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings. In his first season at stud, New Approach sired the classic winners Dawn Approach and Talent.


== Background ==
New Approach, a chestnut colt with a white star and snip was bred by the Lodge Park Stud in Kilkenny Ireland from the second crop of the 2002 Epsom Derby winner Galileo. His dam was the Irish Champion Stakes winner Park Express, making him a half-brother to the Takamatsunomiya Kinen winner Shinko Forest Dazzling Park (by Warning), Champion three-year-old filly in Europe and Alluring Park, the dam of The Oaks winner Was. He was first owned by Mrs J S Bolger & John Corcoran. He was bought in training by Sheikh Mohammed, who presented the colt to his wife Princess Haya of Jordan. He was trained throughout his career by Jim Bolger and ridden in all his starts by Kevin Manning.


== Racing career ==


=== 2007: two-year-old season ===
New Approach was unbeaten in five starts as a two-year-old. He made his debut in a maiden race at The Curragh in July, winning by two lengths in what would be his only race outside group class.Two weeks later he started evens favourite for the Group III Tyros Stakes at Leopardstown and led from the start to win ""easily"". In August he returned to the Curragh to win the Group II Futurity Stakes at odds of 8-11 from Curtain Call, with Henrythenavigator in third, again leading from the start. In September he was moved up to Group I level for the first time in the National Stakes. He made all the running and moved clear in the closing stages to win ""comfortably"", defeating the future Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère winner Rio de la Plata in a race which brought together the top three horses in the ante-post betting for the 2008 2,000 Guineas.
On his final start he travelled outside Ireland for the first time for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. He was already beginning to show signs of a headstrong temperament, and had to ""ponied"" down to the start. In the race, he was held up for the first time, took the lead a furlong out, and, after being put under pressure for the first time in his career, prevailed by half a length from Fast Company, with future Breeders' Cup Classic winner Raven's Pass in third and Rio de la Plata in fourth.


=== 2008: three-year-old season ===


==== Spring ====
On his 2008 debut, New Approach went to the 2,000 Guineas Stakes without a prep race. In the build-up to the race, Bolger had announced that the colt was most unlikely to run in the Epsom Derby, with the Irish Derby being the preferred option In the Guineas, New Approach went off the 11-8 favourite and led as usual, but was caught inside the final furlong and beaten a nose by Henrythenavigator. Three weeks later, in the Irish 2,000 Guineas Henrythenavigator again defeated New Approach, this time by one and three-quarter lengths, with the Bolger colt hanging in the closing stages and apparently unsuited by the fast ground.


==== Summer ====
New Approach was expected to run next in the Irish Derby, but on 2 June Jim Bolger announced an abrupt change of plan. Despite having been left in the Epsom Derby entries by mistake, New Approach would in fact take his chance in the English race. The decision aroused some hostility in the British press, who claimed that those who had already placed bets on the race had been misled. Sent off the 5-1 second favourite, New Approach pulled hard in the early stages as Manning struggled to settle him. Halfway down the straight he seemed to be boxed in and unable to challenge, but a gap appeared on the rail, and he was driven to take the lead a furlong out, staying on to beat Tartan Bearer by half a length. Although the winner's performance was praised, his reception was ""muted"" and Jim Bolger defended the late change of plan in a ""heated"" post-race press conference.
A foot injury ruled New Approach out of the Irish Derby, and he was then aimed at the International Stakes at York in August. The race also attracted the leading older horse Duke of Marmalade who had won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, and the meeting of the two champions was much anticipated by the press as a ""clash of the titans"". Bad ground conditions forced the race to be abandoned, and it was rescheduled for Newmarket four days later. New Approach again failed to settle, and pulled hard in the early stages, but this time he could only finish third behind Duke of Marmalade and Phoenix Tower.


==== Autumn ====
Two weeks later New Approach appeared in the Irish Champion Stakes, a race for which Duke of Marmalade, was a late withdrawal. As usual, he pulled hard from the start, but Kevin Manning was able to settle him, and, after taking the lead early in the straight, he kept on well to win at odds of 8-13. The form of the race was not particularly strong, with the half-length runner-up Traffic Guard having an official rating of only 110, but New Approach's connections were satisfied, with Manning commenting ""he had bundles in the tank"".
New Approach's final start came in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 18 October, for which he was sent off 6-5 favourite against ten opponents. In a performance described in The Observer as ""scintillating"", he took the lead three furlongs out and pulled away from the field to win by six lengths from Twice Over in race record time.


== Assessment and Honours ==
At the end of his 2007 season New Approach was the highest rated two-year-old colt in Europe and won the Cartier Racing Award for Champion Two-Year Old. A year later was given a rating of 130 in the 2008 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, making the equal top-ranked racehorse in the world. He was also named Champion Three-Year-Old colt in the Cartier Awards. New Approach was voted 2008 Irish Horse of the Year in a poll conducted by Horse Racing Ireland, beating Duke of Marmalade, Henrythenavigator and Yeats.


== Stud record ==
New Approach stands as a stallion for the Darley Stud. He spends the first part of the year at the Dalham Stall Stud at Newmarket, and is ""shuttled"" to the Northwood Park Stud Farm in Victoria for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season.
At Royal Ascot in June 2012, horses sired by New Approach in his first season at stud won three of the major races for two-year-olds. Dawn Approach won the Coventry Stakes, Newfangled won the Albany Stakes and Tha'Ir won the Chesham Stakes. In 2013 Dawn Approach won the 2000 Guineas and the St. James's Palace Stakes, Libertarian won the Dante Stakes and was runner up in the Epsom Derby, while Talent won The Oaks and was runner up in the St Leger. In 2014 Sultanina won the Nassau Stakes.

254,"Time Trumpet is a six-episode satirical television comedy series which aired on BBC Two in 2006. The series was written by Armando Iannucci, Roger Drew and Will Smith in a similar manner to Iannucci's earlier one-off programmes 2004: The Stupid Version and Clinton: His Struggle with Dirt. One sketch was later spun off by Irish network RTÉ into the cult TV series Soupy Norman in 2007.


== Premise ==
Time Trumpet is set in the year 2031 and is a retrospective documentary on the first thirty years of the 21st century. Actors and actresses played the parts of 'today's stars' thirty years on, who were interviewed as part of the show. These 'older selves' included David Beckham, Anne Robinson, David Cameron, Sebastian Coe, Charlotte Church, Ant & Dec, June Sarpong, Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Charles Clarke, Noel Edmonds, Chris Moyles, Gordon Brown, David Miliband, Bob Geldof, Natasha Kaplinsky, Prince Harry, Jamie Oliver and the woman who released the doves at the end of the Michael Jackson trial.
The show also included interviews with comedians, billed in the show as ""top cultural commentators slash TV pundits"", speaking about the events of the past. These included Stewart Lee (also appearing as the baldheaded 'Stu Lee', the implication being that he was contractually obliged to shave his head and change his name), Richard Ayoade, Jo Enright, Matthew Holness, Adam Buxton, Mark Watson and David Sant.
Iannucci himself is seen once per episode interviewing guests, but at an oblique angle and with a different physical appearance. Series co-creator Will Smith also appears in the series.
Each episode had a main theme running throughout, such as The Olympics or the War in Iraq. The main running gag was the promise of a catch up with ""an increasingly odd Tom Cruise"" and would feature the elderly actor making bizarre claims such as to be ""pound for pound the world's strongest man"".


== Episodes ==


== Controversy ==
The third episode, which featured a jumbo jet crashing into the British Houses of Parliament and the subsequent assassination of Tony Blair, was due to be screened on 17 August 2006, but was cancelled in the wake of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot and substituted by another episode. The cancelled episode was subsequently shown a week later, without the footage of an assassinated Blair. However, a related sketch was aired, involving a play on the events of 9/11, where two towers are flown into an aeroplane.


== Home release ==
A DVD of the series was released on 27 April 2009. The assassination of Tony Blair sketch was removed from this, as were some sketches that included footage of the Olympic Games.


== Legacy ==
One sketch depicted real-life Polish soap opera Pierwsza miłość becoming a hit across Europe, which was followed by a scene dubbed into English in a humorous way, changing the setting from Poland to Ireland. This ended up forming the basis of the cult TV show Soupy Norman on RTÉ.
Alan Moore's final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen includes a reference to ""Rape An Ape"", as well as several references to Iannucci's The Thick of It.


=== American remake ===
In December 2011, US network Comedy Central announced they would be remaking the series, with Iannucci as producer. Ultimately the series was not picked up by the network, and Iannucci has since moved on to other projects.

The ideal society, according to the Qur’an is Dar as-Salam, literally, ""the house of peace"" of which it intones: And Allah invites to the 'abode of peace' and guides whom He pleases into the right path.
According to Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, there will be an era in which justice, plenty, abundance, well-being, security, peace, and brotherhood will prevail among humanity, and one in which people will experience love, self-sacrifice, tolerance, compassion, mercy, and loyalty. Muhammad said that this blessed period will be experienced through the mediation of the Mahdi, who will come in the end times to save the world from chaos, injustice, and moral collapse. He will eradicate godless ideologies and bring an end to the prevailing injustice. Moreover, he will make religion like it was in the days of Muhammad, cause the Qur'an's moral teachings to prevail among humanity, and establish peace and well-being throughout the world.

256,"This page covers environmental issues in Chile.


== Overview ==
The country of Chile is a virtual continental island bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Andes Mountains on the east, and the Atacama Desert in the north; it is home to several important ecoregions, such as the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests, a biodiversity hotspot that harbors richly endemic flora and fauna, and the Tropical Andes, which stretches into northern Chile.
There are endangered species in Chile, including the South Andean huemul, tundra peregrine falcon, puna rhea, Chilean woodstar, ruddy-headed goose, and green sea turtle. As of 2001, 16 species of mammals in a total of 91 were considered endangered. Of 296 breeding bird species, 18 were threatened with extinction. Also threatened were four types of freshwater fish and 268 plant species.


== Prominent issues ==
There are a series of environmental issues in this country, with a dynamic and diversified economy. Chile's main environmental problems are deforestation and the resulting soil erosion. From 1985 to 1995, Chile lost nearly 2 million hectares of native forest; these forests were destroyed for pulp, and made way for industrial tree farms. As a result, Chile now has the world's largest expanse of radiata pine tree farms and some of the world's most endangered native forests.
Air pollution from industry and transportation and water pollution are especially acute in urban centers. In 1996, Chile's industrial carbon dioxide emissions totaled 48.7 million metric tons. Untreated sewage poses the major threat to the nation's water quality. As of 2001, Chile had 928 cu km of renewable water resources. While 99% of its urban dwellers have pure drinking water, only 58% of its rural dwellers have the same access. Chile is also named after the food Chile. It is served at places like Wendey's. Chile is one of the major mining countries of the world and big-scale mining also represents an important environmental challenge. Severe water shortages affecting many local communities were due not only to persistent drought but to structural problems in the policies governing the exploitation of natural resources, including privatized water management; this led to big protests.


== Water Pollution ==
Much of Chile’s water resources are privatized due to the 1981 Water Code which created a market based on water rights. Water is treated as an asset where once an individual or private company receives water rights, they can choose to sell or rent water. The concentration of water resources in the hands of a few corporations has resulted in Chile having the highest water rates in Latin America. Nearly 90% of the water rights for hydroelectric production are owned by three companies. There are more water rights that have been issued than there are reserves in some parts of the country which has led to the drying up of groundwater resources. This shortage has particularly affected the rural and indigenous population of Chile.
The mining industry has had a considerable impact on the environment of Chile. One region in particular that been significantly impacted is that of the Atacama Desert, which is considered one of the driest regions in the world. Mining requires a large quantity of water, with much of this water coming from groundwater supplies. Dust from mining operations can also accelerate the melting of snow deposits on the Andean glaciers. This puts a considerable strain on snowmelt water supplies which harms the rural communities living in the Atacama. Another source of pollution results from the mining of lithium within some of the lakes in the region. This has the potential to affect local flamingo population as they are reliant on the lakes as a source of shrimp.


== Air Pollution ==
Increased economic activity has resulted in a degradation of Chile’s air quality. Santiago, the capital city of Chile, is surrounded by mountain ranges which facilitates the accumulation of pollutants from car emissions and industrial development over the region. Hospitals become overcrowded as a result of respiratory related problems each year in Santiago. The air pollution in Santiago has resulted in an average of 20,000 people suffering from respiratory problems every year. It is common to use wood for heating in the southern portion of Chile, which tends to experience cold temperatures, as it is less costly than gas or electricity.

259,"Lake Albanel is located east of Lake Mistassini and covers a total area of approximately 445 square kilometres (172 sq mi). It is located in the region of Jamésie. Quebec Route 167 ends beside this lake. It is entirely located in the protected area of Lacs-Albanel-Mistassini-et-Waconichi.


== Formation theory ==
In 2016, it was reported that the arc shaped lake, together with nearby Lake Mistassini, may have been formed by a large meteor impact about 2.1 billion years ago. The rest of the 500 km diameter crater is thought to have now been mostly eroded away or buried but geological indications of a major impact have been found in the rocks around the lake. If confirmed this would be the largest impact crater found on the earth.


== Etymology ==
Lake Albanel is named in honour of Charles Albanel who discovered it in 1672.

266,"Restrictive dermopathy is a rare, lethal autosomal recessive skin condition characterized by syndromic facies, tight skin, sparse or absent eyelashes, and secondary joint changes.


== Mechanism ==
Restrictive dermopathy (RD) is caused either by the loss of the gene ZMPSTE24, which encodes a protein responsible for the cleavage of farnesylated prelamin A into mature non-farnesylated lamin, or by a mutation in the LMNA gene. This results in the accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A at the nuclear membrane. Mechanistically, restrictive dermopathy is somewhat similar to Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a disease where the last step in lamin processing is hindered by a mutation that causes the loss of the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site in the lamin A gene.

270,"Old Bailey Street is located in Central, Hong Kong. The name is derived from the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court in central London, United Kingdom.
Victoria Prison, the first prison in Hong Kong, was built on Old Bailey Street in 1841. As the population in Hong Kong grew, a larger prison was needed and in 1925 construction began in Stanley. Later that year a new prison opened as Stanley Prison where those sentenced to more than a year in detention were sent.
During the early colonisation of Hong Kong, prisoners in Victoria Prison were forced to parade in public, were often beaten with a cane, and their arms locked with a cangue on which their name and crimes-committed were penned. Policeman, often of Indian descent, would walk the prisoners to a plaza in front of the Man Mo Temple where the lawbreakers were scoffed and condemned by the passers-by. After a few hours, the criminal was returned to the Old Bailey Street jail. This form of punishment was abolished after World War I.
The old Victoria Prison still stands on Old Bailey Street, but is no longer in use. It was closed in December 2005 and the Hong Kong Government is currently in consultation as to what to do with both the Prison and the old Central Police Station, which is at the intersection of Old Bailey Street and Hollywood Road.

272,"Saturation arithmetic is a version of arithmetic in which all operations such as addition and multiplication are limited to a fixed range between a minimum and maximum value.
If the result of an operation is greater than the maximum, it is set (""clamped"") to the maximum; if it is below the minimum, it is clamped to the minimum. The name comes from how the value becomes ""saturated"" once it reaches the extreme values; further additions to a maximum or subtractions from a minimum will not change the result.
For example, if the valid range of values is from -100 to 100, the following operations produce the following values:
60 + 30 = 90
60 + 43 = 100
(60 + 43) − (75 + 75) = 0
10 × 11 = 100
99 × 99 = 100
30 × (5 − 1) = 100
30 × 5 − 30 × 1 = 70
As can be seen from these examples, familiar properties like associativity and distributivity may fail in saturation arithmetic. This makes it unpleasant to deal with in abstract mathematics, but it has an important role to play in digital hardware and algorithms.


== Modern use ==
Typically, general-purpose microprocessors do not implement integer arithmetic operations using saturation arithmetic; instead, they use the easier-to-implement modular arithmetic, in which values exceeding the maximum value ""wrap around"" to the minimum value, like the hours on a clock passing from 12 to 1. In hardware, modular arithmetic with a minimum of zero and a maximum of rn-1, where r is the radix can be implemented by simply discarding all but the lowest n digits. For binary hardware, which the vast majority of modern hardware is, the radix is 2 and the digits are bits.
However, although more difficult to implement, saturation arithmetic has numerous practical advantages. The result is as numerically close to the true answer as possible; for 8-bit binary signed arithmetic, when the correct answer is 130, it is considerably less surprising to get an answer of 127 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of −126 from modular arithmetic. Likewise, for 8-bit binary unsigned arithmetic, when the correct answer is 258, it is less surprising to get an answer of 255 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of 2 from modular arithmetic.
Saturation arithmetic also enables overflow of additions and multiplications to be detected consistently without an overflow bit or excessive computation, by simple comparison with the maximum or minimum value (provided the datum is not permitted to take on these values).
Additionally, saturation arithmetic enables efficient algorithms for many problems, particularly in digital signal processing. For example, adjusting the volume level of a sound signal can result in overflow, and saturation causes significantly less distortion to the sound than wrap-around. In the words of researchers G. A. Constantinides et al.:

When adding two numbers using two’s complement representation, overflow results in a ‘wrap-around’ phenomenon. The result can be a catastrophic loss in signal-to-noise ratio in a DSP system. Signals in DSP designs are therefore usually either scaled appropriately to avoid overflow for all but the most extreme input vectors, or produced using saturation arithmetic components.

Saturation arithmetic operations are available on many modern platforms, and in particular was one of the extensions made by the Intel MMX platform, specifically for such signal processing applications. This functionality is also available in wider versions in the SSE2 and AVX2 integer instruction sets.
Saturation arithmetic for integers has also been implemented in software for a number of programming languages including C, C++, and Eiffel. This helps programmers anticipate and understand the effects of overflow better. On the other hand, saturation is challenging to implement efficiently in software on a machine with only modular arithmetic operations, since simple implementations require branches that create huge pipeline delays. However, it is possible to implement saturating addition and subtraction in software without branches, using only modular arithmetic and bitwise logical operations that are available on all modern CPUs and their predecessors, including all x86 CPUs (back to the original Intel 8086) and some popular 8-bit CPUs (some of which, such as the Zilog Z80, are still in production). (However, on simple 8-bit and 16-bit CPUs, a branching algorithm might actually be faster if programmed in assembly, since there are no pipelines to stall and each instruction always takes multiple clock cycles.)
Although saturation arithmetic is less popular for integer arithmetic in hardware, the IEEE floating-point standard, the most popular abstraction for dealing with approximate real numbers, uses a form of saturation in which overflow is converted into ""infinity"" or ""negative infinity"", and any other operation on this result continues to produce the same value. This has the advantage over simple saturation that later operations which decrease the value will not end up producing a misleadingly ""reasonable"" result, such as in the computation

273,"""How Do U Want It"" is a song performed by Tupac Shakur. The third single from his album All Eyez on Me, it features R&B duo K-Ci & JoJo, who at the time were best known as the lead singers of Jodeci. The song was released on June 16, 1996. It was a Double A-side single to ""California Love"" in the United States, and the song reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #17 in the UK in 1996.
It samples Quincy Jones's ""Body Heat"" from his 1974 album, Body Heat. The song includes a diss of noted gangsta rap critic C. Delores Tucker. The Concert/Clean version's 3rd verse completely differs to the version found on the album. The song appears in the 1997 film, Gang Related, which was Tupac's final film performance prior to his death, and also appears in the 2002 film Friday After Next.
The song was nominated at the 1997 Grammys for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.


== Music videos ==
There were three videos filmed for this song: two in the same set for the single in April 1996 directed by Ron Hightower and produced by Tracy D. Robinson. These two are distinguished by music ratings (one is certified adult material). The video portrays a wild sex party with jacuzzi, mechanical bull riding, cage dancing and pole stripping. All actors and actresses are dressed in renaissance-age costumes, though all clothes are removed for the nude clip. The adult-material video also features numerous porn stars, including Nina Hartley, Heather Hunter, and Angel Kelly.
The limousine segment seen in the clean version is the same except no nudity. The third one is the concert version, mostly them performing on stage (not the House Of Blues live performance). There are cameo appearances by K-Ci & JoJo, and fellow group member of Digital Underground Shock G both in the concert and studio segments.

275,"ESM Government Securities, Inc. was a Fort Lauderdale, Florida based government securities dealer, specializing in repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. The failure of the company in March 1985 precipitated the collapse of Home State Savings Bank, deposit runs on dozens of other banks in Ohio, and the downfall of the private Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.
ESM was started in 1975 by Ronnie Ewton, Robert Seneca and George Mead, taking the name of the company from the first letter of their last names. (Seneca resigned from the company in 1978.) Alan Novick joined soon afterwards and would later become president (but died in November 1984 of a heart attack). Stephen Arky, an attorney, met Ronnie Ewton in his National Guard unit, and introduced him to his father-in-law Marvin Warner, the owner of Home State Savings Bank in Cincinnati Ohio.
ESM was shut down on March 4, 1985 by the Securities and Exchange Commission and placed into receivership after massive fraud was discovered. ESM had suffered large operating losses and had pledged the same collateral to more than one lender, with initial estimated losses of over $300 million. Home State Savings Bank was the biggest customer of ESM and it was revealed that Home State would suffer a loss of about $150 million from their transactions with ESM. A run on the bank ensued with over $100 million withdrawn in a few days. The bank was closed on March 9, 1985. Bank runs ensued on other institutions insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund after it was revealed that the fund had insufficient funds to pay off Home State depositors. A bank holiday was declared by the governor of Ohio for those banks covered by the Fund. Other major victims of ESM included the cities of Beaumont, Texas, Toledo, Ohio and Pompano Beach, Florida; Clark County, Nevada, Clallam County, Washington, and American Savings & Loan of Miami.
An investigation showed that Jose Gomez, a partner in the Certified Public Accountant firm of Alexander Grant & Company, was given bribes to falsify the financial statements. Seven people involved with ESM pleaded guilty in April 1986, including Ronnie Ewton, George Mead, four other executives of the firm, and Jose Gomez. Ewton received 15 years in prison, Mead received 14 years, and Gomez received 12 years.  Stephen Arky committed suicide in July 1985. Henry Earl Riddel, the company's controller, committed suicide in November 1986. Marvin Warner was convicted in March 1987 of nine counts of fraud-related charges relating to Home State Savings Bank and served 28 months in prison. Alexander Grant & Co. paid out $173 million in damages and legal fees.
The United States Congress enacted the Government Securities Act of 1986 in response to the failure of ESM and other similar government dealer failures and scandals.

278,"The Costa de Almería (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkosta ðe almeˈɾi.a], ""Coast of Almería"") consists of the coastal municipalities of the province of Almería, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. The coast extends 217 kilometres (135 mi) and includes 13 municipalities, from Pulpí on the border with the province of Murcia to Adra on the border with the province of Granada.


== Tourism ==
The name ""Costa de Almería"" is a term established for purposes of promoting tourism within the region. Beginning on 16 February 1928, tourism promoter Rodolfo Lussnigg began promoting the area under the name Costa del Sol; however, that name, originally referring specifically to the city of Almería, has since become attached to the coast of the province of Málaga.
Among the tourist destinations on the Costa de Almería are Vera, Mojácar, Roquetas de Mar and Almerimar, and such natural areas as the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, the Punta Entinas-Sabinar Nature Reserve, and the Isla de San Andrés.


== History ==

Almería has been home to different civilisations throughout its history. Significant traces of their presence can be seen in the archaeological remains scattered all over the province.
There is evidence of a very special prehistoric culture in Los Millares and el Argar. Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Greeks exploited its mines and traded up and down its coast. The Romans, who settled here in the 3rd century B.C., transformed it into ""Porto Magnus"" on the Mediterranean and dominated the area until the later arrival of the Visigoths in the 7th century. The Arabs created the current capital in the 10th century, and from here they ruled over one of the most important taifas (kingdoms) in Muslim Spain. The Arab influence was the most significant, as they remained in Spain for almost eight centuries. There are several monuments which bear witness to the fertile history of this land. The castles and fortresses provide an exceptional historic testimony for understanding the societies of the past.
Long exposed to border conflicts and the need to defend itself, the province of Almería has a large number and variety of castles which comprise a heritage known to few. The mining industry brought about an economic recovery in the 19th century.


== Landscape ==
The Sierra María-Los Vélez Nature Reserves with their castle, their caves and their rich fauna, and the Cabo de Gata-Nijar Nature Reserve, with its deserted beaches, wild cliffs and transparent sea beds, bring alive a landscape which offers the traveller the magic of snow, the Mediterranean forest, the desert and the sea.


== Coastal municipalities and comarcas ==
The municipalities that make up the Costa de Almería fall into three comarcas:
Levante Almeriense is in the eastern part of the province, adjacent to the province of Murcia, and includes the coastal municipalities of Carboneras, Mojácar, Garrucha, Vera, Cuevas del Almanzora, and Pulpí.
The Metropolitan Comarca of Almería around the Bay of Almería includes the provincial capital Almería and the municipality of Níjar, which includes most of the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park.
Poniente Almeriense is in the southwest of the province, adjacent to the province of Granada, and includes the coastal municipalities of Adra, Berja, El Ejido (including Almerimar), Roquetas de Mar, and Enix.

279,"Sol Katz (August 3, 1947 – April 23, 1999) was an American software developer who pioneered geospatial computer software (a sub-category of GIS) and left behind a large body of work in the form of computer applications and format specifications while at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. This early archive provided both source code and applications freely available to the community. Katz was also a frequent contributor to many geospatial list servers.
Katz was born in Sweden in 1947 and moved to New York City at the age of 1. Yiddish was his first language, but he learned both Hebrew and English. After high school, he spent three years in the US Air Force, stationed in Germany. Following his brief military career, he decided to go to Brooklyn College in New York where he got his bachelor's degree in geology in 2.5 years. He then married his wife Hedy in 1969, and went back to Brooklyn College while teaching in New York Public Schools and got his master's degree, also in geology. After several years working for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in several states, he settled down in Lakewood, Colorado and decided to go back to school at the University of Denver to study computer science and earned a second master's degree. At this time, he also had two children - Shanna and Risa. Katz died on April 23, 1999 from Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

286,"Mar de ardora es el término con el que se designan los mares luminosos o fosforescentes, también conocidos en inglés como milky seas.
Se trata de un fenómeno luminoso producido en el océano donde grandes masas de agua emiten una misteriosa luz azul debido, según recientes estudios, a la proliferación de una bacteria bioluminiscente (Vibrio harveyi, asociada a las microalgas de plancton.
La bioluminiscencia se extiende en todas direcciones y pueden manifestar su luminosidad durante días u horas.
Este resplandor nocturno, citado por primera vez por Julio Verne en su obra Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino cuando relató la travesía del Nautilus a través de una capa fosforescente (atribuida en la novela a miríadas de animales marinos luminosos), fue también, durante siglos, mito de los marineros que surcaban el Índico.
Los científicos empezaron a registrar este fenómeno en 1915, quedando reconocidos en todo el planeta más de 200 mares de ardora, concentrados en su mayoría en el noroeste del océano Índico y próximos a Indonesia. Otros lugares donde se pudo visualizar este espectáculo luminoso fueron la costa de Somalia (África), el sur de Portugal y la bahía Fosforescente, en Puerto Rico.
En 2005, un grupo de investigadores del Laboratorio de Investigación Naval de EE.UU y del Instituto de Investigación del Acuario de la Bahía de Monterrey, dirigidos por el científico Steve Miller, consiguieron fotografiar, por primera vez, este fenómeno a través del satélite oceanográfico. Esas fotos fueron publicadas en noviembre de ese mismo año en la prestigiosa revista científica Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Culinariamente hablando la denominada grosura era: la cabeza, pies y manos y la asadura de los animales. A estas preparaciones a base de casquería y despojos de animales diversos se le denominaba carne de sábado.[2]​ Esta costumbre castellana de comer asaduras los sábados aparece reflejada en diversas obras literarias como es el Lazarillo de Tormes (se menciona comer cabezas de ternero los sábados) en La vida del Buscón de Francisco de Quevedo, en el Don Quijote de la Mancha de Cervantes (donde se menciona comer duelos y quebrantos).[2]​

Variedades de uva tinta: las variedades principales son el tempranillo, prieto picudo y mencía. Las variedades complementarias son la garnacha y cabernet sauvignon.


=== Cultivo ===
Conforme a su reglamento, las prácticas de cultivo de la viña se realizarán de manera que expresen el mejor equilibrio entre la vegetación y la calidad de la producción y tendrán en cuenta las características de los sistemas de cultivo de cada parcela. Tanto para variedades tintas como blancas, la densidad de plantación mínima será de 900 cepas por hectárea y la máxima de 4.500 cepas por hectárea.[3]​
La formación de la cepa y su conducción se efectuarán con las condiciones precisas para la obtención de uva de calidad en función de los suelos y condiciones técnicas de cada viñedo y con la finalidad de cumplir con lo establecido en cuanto a producciones máximas admitidas su reglamento, y se efectuará de la siguiente manera:[3]​
Tradicional en vaso y sus variantes. En ningún caso el número de yemas productivas será superior a 36.000 yemas por ha.
Formación en espaldera: en plantaciones dirigidas y apoyadas. En ningún caso el número de yemas productivas será superior a 42.000 yemas por ha.
Se autoriza el riego del viñedo con carácter general hasta el día 31 de julio de cada año. Para poder regar con posterioridad a las fechas indicadas, el viticultor deberá presentar una solicitud de autorización ante el órgano de gestión en la que se justifique la necesidad en función de las condiciones climáticas y agronómicas existentes. En dicha solicitud figurarán los siguientes datos de la parcela regada: número de polígono y parcela, superficie, forma de conducción,y tipo y dosis de riego de la parcela regada. Con posterioridad al riego y siempre antes de la fecha que se determine por el órgano de gestión el viticultor deberá comunicarle la estimación de cosecha esperada por parcela regada. Las parcelas se someterán a los aforos de cosecha necesarios para garantizar el cumplimiento del reglamento.[3]​

290,"La sarcoidosis, (del griego sarx, que significa ""carne"") o enfermedad de Besnier-Boeck, es una enfermedad granulomatosa sistémica, de carácter autoinmune, que afecta a todas las poblaciones y etnias humanas, y fundamentalmente a adultos entre 20 y 40 años. Sus causas son desconocidas. Los síntomas pueden aparecer repentinamente, pero suelen manifestarse de manera gradual. El curso de la enfermedad es variable y puede ser desde asintomática hasta crónica (en el 5% de los casos), pudiendo llevar a la muerte (sólo en un 1% de los casos en que se hace crónica).
La enfermedad puede manifestarse en cualquier órgano del cuerpo, con mayor frecuencia en el pulmón y ganglios intratorácicos. También son frecuentes las manifestaciones oculares, cutáneas y hepáticas.


== Etiología ==
Su etiología es desconocida, la hipótesis más aceptada es que se trata de una respuesta inmunitaria a exposición de factores ambientales en individuos genéticamente predispuestos.


== Epidemiología ==
Afecta comúnmente a adultos jóvenes de ambos sexos, aunque es ligeramente más frecuente entre las mujeres. Hay dos picos de incidencia: en el grupo de edad de 20 a 29 años y en mujeres de más de 50 años[1]​[2]​ .
Es una enfermedad que afecta a todas las poblaciones humanas, con una incidencia media de 16,5/100.000 en hombres y 19/100.000 en mujeres. Es más frecuente en los países del Norte de Europa, siendo la incidencia anual más alta en Suecia e Islandia (60 por cada 100.000 habitantes). En Estados Unidos, la sarcoidosis es más común en personas de ascendencia africana que en caucásicos, con una incidencia anual de 35,5 y 10,9 por cada 100.000 habitantes, respectivamente.[3]​ Parece ser menos frecuente en Sudamérica, España, Canadá, Filipinas y la India. En concreto, apenas se han registrado casos en inmigrantes del norte de España.
Las diferencias en la incidencia de esta enfermedad pueden deberse en parte a la falta de diagnóstico en determinadas regiones del mundo y a la presencia de otras enfermedades granulomatosas como la tuberculosis, que pueden enmascarar la sarcoidosis.[1]​
Puede haber diferencias étnicas en la severidad de la enfermedad. Diversos estudios sugieren que en personas de origen africano el curso puede ser más grave y la enfermedad estar más diseminada, mientras que las personas de raza caucásica suelen desarrollarla de forma asintomática con más frecuencia.[4]​
Los síntomas parecen ser ligeramente diferentes según etnia y género: el eritema nodoso es mucho más común en hombres que en mujeres y en caucásicos que en cualquier otra etnia. En Japón son más comunes las afecciones cardiacas y oftalmológicas.[2]​


== Diagnóstico ==

Su diagnóstico generalmente se hace por exclusión con una clínica compatible, imágenes radiológicas sugerentes y la confirmación histológica con presencia de granulomas no caseosos.
Dentro de los diagnósticos diferenciales está el linfoma, metástasis pulmonares, síndrome de Caplan, Granulomatosis de Wegener e infecciones atípicas, tales como citomegalovirus, cryptococo o Mycobacterium avium.
Otros de los hallazgos que se pueden encontrar con relativa frecuencia son:
Hipercalcemia
Niveles elevados de Vitamina D
Niveles elevados de VHS
Aumento de los niveles séricos de ECA


== Sintomatología ==

La sarcoidosis es una enfermedad sistémica que puede afectar a cualquier órgano. Los síntomas más comunes son imprecisos: fatiga, falta de energía, pérdida de peso, dolores articulares, sequedad ocular, visión borrosa, falta de aliento, tos seca o lesiones cutáneas, que varían desde enrojecimientos y pequeños nódulos hasta eritema nodoso o lupus. A menudo es asintomática.
La combinación de eritema nodoso, linfadenopatía bilateral y dolor articular recibe el nombre de síndrome de Löfgren, y tiene un pronóstico relativamente bueno.
Pueden producirse afecciones renales, hepáticas, cardiacas o encefálicas, que pueden provocar alteraciones funcionales posteriores. Las manifestaciones oculares incluyen uveitis, uveoparotitis (asociada con el síndrome de Heerfordt-Waldenstrom) e inflamación de retina, que puede provocar pérdida de visión clara o ceguera.


=== Corazón ===
Aunque el compromiso cardiaco está presente en un 20-30% de los pacientes con sarcoidosis, sólo un 5% de los pacientes presenta síntomas. La presentación de sarcoidosis cardiaca puede ir desde anormalidades asintomáticas en la conducción hasta incluso arritmias ventriculares. La Sarcoidosis miocárdica es una de las causas muy poco frecuentes de muerte súbita cardiaca.


=== Ocular ===
Se presenta con uveítis, uveoparotiditis y retinitis lo cual puede llevar a la ceguera total.


=== Sistema Nervioso ===
La combinación de uveoparotiditis, compromiso y parálisis del nervio facial y fiebre, se le denomina uveoparotiditis febril (también denominada (Heerfordt-Waldenstrom syndrome). El compromiso del SN es menor al 1% de los pacientes con sarcoidosis, afectando generalmente, las meninges basales lo cual implica compromiso a nivel de los nervios creaneales. Además, puede debutar como mielopatía cuando existe compromiso intramedular.


=== Fanereos ===
Existe alopecía central o en parches a nivel del cuero cabelludo.


== Tratamiento ==
Entre el 30 y el 70% de los pacientes no requiere tratamiento. Se han venido utilizando corticosteroides, en concreto prednisona. En algunos pacientes, este tratamiendo puede ralentizar o revertir el curso de la enfermedad, pero otros no responden a esta terapia. Su uso es controvertido porque en muchos casos la enfermedad remite espontáneamente. Además los corticosteroides tienen efectos secundarios, de manera que su uso se suele limitar a los casos más graves.
También se suelen tratar los síntomas severos con inmunosupresores, como la azatioprina. Al estar los granulomas provocados por acumulación de células inmunitarias, especialmente linfocitos T, algunos inmunosupresores han resultado eficaces, como los inhibidores de la interleuquina-2 o del TNF alfa. Pero ninguno de ellos es completamente eficaz y además pueden tener efectos secundarios, incrementándose el riesgo de reactivación de una tuberculosis latente o de desarrollar determinados tumores.
Aproximadamente la mitad de los casos remiten o se pueden curar en 12-36 meses y la mayor parte de ellos en 5 años. Pocas veces la enfermedad persiste durante décadas.


== Relación con la silicosis ==
El Servicio de Neumología Ocupacional del Instituto Nacional de Silicosis cree haber descubierto una nueva causa que incrementa y acelera la agresividad de la Silicosis en la Sarcoidosis silicótico.
Según la doctora Aida Quero, una de las máximas responsables de la investigación, este descubrimiento podría tener importantes efectos sobre el tratamiento de ambas enfermedades, ya que abre la posibilidad de desarrollar nuevos fármacos.


=== Relación entre sí ===
La doctora Quero describió la posible relación entre ambas patologías tras analizar la literatura y observar que los pacientes silicóticos en la fase dos y tres de la enfermedad presentaban cuadros similares a la sarcoidosis pulmonar. Los enfermos que padecían sarcoidosis pulmonar incluidos en su estudio tenían también lesiones propias de la silicosis.El Instituto Nacional de Seguridad en el Trabajo de Estados Unidos concluyó ya en 1980 que las personas que se encontraban expuestas a sílice de forma habitual corrían mayor riesgo de contraer una sarcoidosis pulmonar.
En el estudio publicado por la Dra. Quero se analizaron las historias clínicas de 25 casos de sarcoidosis atendidos en el Instituto de Silicosis entre 1980 y 2000. Se observó que doce de los afectados trabajaban en industrias con alta presencia de sílice; en su mayor parte, mineros y personal de canteras de granito. Además, de diez de ellos se tenían radiografías que confirmaban (según los investigadores) la presencia de lesiones típicas de la silicosis. Uno de los casos investigados correspondía a una persona que había fallecido, que en el estudio anatomopatológico postmortem se describió un cuadro de silicosis acelerada.

291,"Rhodri el Grande (en galés: Rhodri Mawr; en ocasiones en inglés: Roderick el Grande) (820 - 878) fue el primer gobernante de Gales que recibió el título de ""el Grande"" y el primero en gobernar la mayor parte del actual Gales. También es llamado ""Rey de los Britones"" en los Anales del Ulster. Históricamente se le atribuye la construcción del primer castillo de Dinefwr.


== Linaje y herencia ==
Hijo de Merfyn Frych, rey de Gwynedd y de Nest ferch Cadell, del linaje real del reino de Powys, heredó el reino de Gwynedd a la muerte de su padre en el año 844.
Cuando su tío Cyngen ap Cadell, gobernante de Powys, murió en un peregrinaje a Roma en el año 855, Rhodri también heredó Powys. En el año 872 Gwgon, gobernante de Seisyllwg en el sur de Gales, se ahogó accidentalmente y Rhodri añadió su reino a sus dominios en virtud de su matrimonio con Angharad, hermana de Gwgon, convirtiéndose en el gobernante de la mayor parte de Gales.


== Resistencia contra los daneses ==
Rhodri se enfrentó a la presión de sus vecinos ingleses y de los ataques de los vikingos daneses, que saquearon la isla de Anglesey en el año 854. En el año 856 Rhodri consiguió una considerable victoria sobre los daneses, matando a su líder Gorm (en ocasiones llamado Horm). Dos poemas de Sedulio Escoto, escritos en la corte de Carlos el Calvo, rey de los francos, celebran la victoria de ""Roricus"" sobre los hombres del norte.
En el año 877 Rhodri luchó de nuevo contra los invasores nórdicos en Anglesey, pero en esta ocasión fue derrotado y obligado a huir a Irlanda.


== Derrota y muerte ==
A su regreso al año siguiente, se dice que Rhodri y su hijo Gwriad fuyeron asesinados por los ingleses, gobernados durante esta época por el rey Alfredo el Grande, aunque la naturaleza precisa de su muerte se desconoce. Cuando su hijo, Anarawd ap Rhodri, consiguió una victoria sobre el reino de Mercia unos pocos años después, en las crónicas se considera que fue la venganza de Dios por la muerte de Rhodri.


== Sucesión ==
Su hijo Cadell ap Rhodri conquistó Dyfed, que posteriormente su nieto Hywel Dda uniría a Seisyllwg para formar el reino de Deheubarth. Como su abuelo, Hywell conseguiría unir y gobernar la mayor parte de Gales.
Rhodri tuvo seis hijos, de los que le sucedieron en el poder Anarawd como rey de Gwynedd, Merfyn como rey de Powys y Cadell como príncipe de Seisyllwg. Gwriad murió con su padre y Elen posiblemente se casó con Owain ap Hywel, rey de Glamorgan.

294,"La gens Quintilia (en latín, gens Quinctilia o Quintilia) fue un conjunto de familias de origen patricio de la Antigua Roma que compartían el nomen Quintilio, atestiguadas en el periodo más temprano de la historia romana y continuando hasta tiempo imperial. A pesar de su gran antigüedad, la gens nunca logró mucha importancia histórica. El único miembro que obtuvo el consulado bajo la República fue Sexto Quintilio Varo en 453 a. C. La gens produjo numerosos pretores y otros magistrados, pero no obtuvo el consulado de nuevo en más de cuatrocientos años.[1]​


== Origen de la gens ==
El nomen Quintilio es un patronímico, basado en el praenomen Quinto, que significa quinto. Quinctilius es la ortografía correcta, pero Quintilius es también bastante común. La gens Quincia deriva del mismo praenomen. No era inusual para muchos nomina derivar de una fuente común; el nombre sabino Pompo es el equivalente osco de Quinto, y dio lugar a las gentes Pompilia y Pomponia.
Según la leyenda, los Quintilios precedieron a la fundación de Roma. Cuando los hermanos Rómulo y Remo habían restaurado a su abuelo, Numitor, al trono de Alba Longa, se propusieron establecer una nueva ciudad en los cerros que dominan el Tíber. Ofrecieron sacrificios en la cueva del Lupercal en la base del Monte Palatino, de cuyo rito se originó el festival religioso de las Lupercales. Los seguidores de Rómulo se llamaron quintilios o quintilianos, mientras que los de Remo fueron los 'fabios o fabianos.
En tiempo histórico, los dos colegios de sacerdotes, conocidos como lupercos, que llevaban a cabo los rituales sagrados de las Lupercalia, eran conocidos por estos nombres, sugiriendo que en tiempo anterior, las gentes Quintilia y Fabia supervisaban estos ritos como sacro gentilicum. Otro ejemplo de tales responsabilidades afectaba a los Pinarios y los Poticios, quienes mantuvieron la adoración de Hércules. Tales ritos sagrados fueron gradualmente transferidos al estado, o abiertos al populus romano; una leyenda bien conocida atribuyó la destrucción de los Poticios al abandono de su oficio religioso. En tiempo posterior, el privilegio de las Lupercalia había cesado, para ser limitado a los Fabios y los Quintilios.[2]​[3]​[4]​[5]​[6]​[7]​[8]​


== Praenomina utilizados por la gens ==
Los nombres principales utilizados por los Quintilios eran Publio y Sexto. Unos cuantos Quintilios llevaron los praenomina Lucio, Marco, y Tito. A pesar de que el nombre tiene que haber sido utilizado por alguno de sus antepasados, ninguno de los Quintilios conocidos en la historia se llamó Quinto.[1]​[9]​


== Ramas y cognomina de la gens ==
El único cognomen de familia de los Quintilios bajo la República es Varo, un acognomen común que significaba doblado, torcido, o patizambo. Otros cognomina se han encontrado en tiempo imperial.[1]​[10]​[11]​

295,"El término lengua preincaicas se refiere a todas las lenguas andinas y amazónicas habladas a lo largo de la franja occidental de América del Sur que se hablaban en el territorio del imperio incaico antes de la expansión del quechua. Muchas de estas lenguas fueron desplazadas bien porque las poblaciones fueron deportadas, diezmadas o asimiladas políticamente por los incas o por la colonización europea posterior. En muchos casos la substitución lingüística completa se produjo en favor del quechua, incluso durante la administración colonial europea, influendo las lenguas preincaicas en las variedades de quechua posteriores.


== Lenguas preincaicas ==
A continuación se da una lista más o menos exhaustiva de lenguas preincaicas. El signo (†) se empeará para las lenguas extintas que fueron desplazadas o substituidas por el quechua o el español, y que se conviritieron en lenguas muertas. La clasificación se hace en términos geográficos y dentro de cada área la división se basa en criterios de parentesco filogenético. Existe un número de lenguas insuficientemente documentadas o no documentadas, de las que no es posible dar una filiación genética precisa, esto es bastante frecuente para Ecuador y norte de Perú donde se conoce un buen número de testimonios que hablan de estas lenguas, la mayor parte extintas entre los siglos XVI y XVII.
La lista de lenguas preincaicas conocidas es:
Lenguas preincaicas del norte y oeste de Ecuador y sur de Colombia:
Lenguas cañar-puruhá (†)
Lenguas barbacoanas
Pasto (†),
Sindagua (?), podría ser el antecesor del moderno awa pit o cuaiquer.
Caranqui (†), lengua del reino de Quito hablada por los shyris (quitu-caras) y caranquis propiamente dichos. Esta lengua se extendía desde el valle del río Mira y el valle del río Chota hasta la ciudad de Quito, cubriendo una región de los Andes situada en la provincia de Imbabura y el norte de la provincia de Pichincha.

297,"Aurora Redondo Pérez (Barcelona, 1 de enero de 1900-El Escorial, Madrid, 9 de julio de 1996) fue una actriz española.[2]​[3]​


== Biografía ==

Comenzó su carrera teatral a la edad de siete años. Debutó en la ciudad que le vio nacer en el Teatro Romea con la obra Doncell qui cerca Muller. Tras algunas funciones en Barcelona viaja a Madrid, donde actúa en el Teatro de la Comedia, con obras como Que viene mi marido (1918) y Los caciques (1920) y Es mi hombre (1921), todas ellas de Carlos Arniches. En 1937 representó en el Teatro Cómico de Buenos Aires El Padre Pitillo del mismo autor (400 representaciones). Arniches, además, fue el padrino de su boda con el también actor Valeriano León en 1925.
Los dos trabajaron juntos en muchas ocasiones interpretando obras de los hermanos Álvarez Quintero, Pedro Muñoz Seca, Jacinto Benavente o Carlos Arniches entre otros. El fallecimiento de su marido en 1955 hizo que continuara su carrera en solitario, Las buenas personas, Aventura en lo gris (1963), Cita en Senlis (1963), Ninette y un señor de Murcia (1965); Buenos días condesita (1965); Un millón en la basura (1966), La vil seducción (1967), La pereza (1968), Petra regalada (1980), Las tormentas no vuelven (1982), La casa de Bernarda Alba (1984), Don Juan Tenorio (1987), Maribel y la extraña familia (1989) o Melocotón en almíbar, su última función, que interpreta con noventa y tres años de edad.
A pesar de su dedicación al teatro, también realizó incursiones en el cine y la televisión, destacando su papel en la serie Anillos de oro (1983).
A lo largo de su carrera recibió muchos premios y reconocimientos. Entre otros se encuentran: el Premio María Guerrero (1984); la Medalla al Mérito Artístico (1993); el Segismundo de la Asociación de Directores de Escena (1991); el Premio Miguel Mihura de la SGAE (1992).
Falleció por muerte natural el 9 de julio de 1996 a los 96 años. Fue incinerada en el crematorio del Cementerio de La Almudena al día siguiente, y la urna con sus cenizas introducidas en el panteón familiar del mismo cementerio.

299,"El radar de Onda Continua (CW del inglés Continuous Wave) es un tipo particular de radar que transmite, y luego recibe, ondas continuas, típicamente del modo sinusoidal.
En este tipo de radar, la posibilidad de medir la distancia del blanco está ligada a la longitud de la banda, que debe ser bastante amplia; y se aplica a la onda portadora un tipo de marca temporal para permitir obtener información del tiempo de trasmisión y de retorno. Cuanto más rápido sea, mejor será la medición, pero entretanto mayor será la banda, y no siempre es realizable, por eso se opta por un arreglo entre esos parámetros.
El espectro de las transmisiones de CW puede ser modulado sea en frecuencia como en amplitud.
En el primer caso, de frecuencia, se trata de un radar FMCW; donde su frecuencia de transmisión se varia en función del tiempo en cada periodo. Si se supone que la frecuencia de transmisión aumenta linealmente con el tiempo; sea un objeto reflectante que se encuentra a una distancia R, la señal del eco, representada en la figura como una línea de trayectoria, retornará después de un tiempo :
  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          
            
              2
              R
            
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T={{2R} \over {C}}}
  .
Si esta señal ingresa en un mezclador heterodino, una parte de la señal de transmisión produce un abatimiento fb; en ausencia de efecto Doppler en la frecuenia, fb (frecuencia de diferencia) representando una medida de la distancia al blanco, y fb=fr, donde fr es el abatimiento debido exclusivamente al la distancia al blanco.
Si la rapidez de las variaciones de la frecuencia portante es f, la frecuencia de abatimiento será

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            r
          
        
        =
        
          
            f
            
              0
            
          
          T
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                f
                
                  0
                
              
              2
              R
            
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{r}={f_{0}T}={{f_{0}2R} \over {C}}}
  
La frecuencia, no puede variar siempre en una única dirección: será necesaria una periodicidad en la modulación, que típicamente es triangular, pero puede también ser en diente de sierra, sinusoidal o de otra forma.
Si la frecuencia se modula con rapidez fm sobre el intervalo Δf, la frecuencia de abatimiento será: 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            r
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              2
              R
              2
              
                f
                
                  m
                
              
              Δ
              f
            
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{r}={{2R2f_{m}\Delta f} \over {C}}}
  , de lo cual se determina la distancia R del objeto.

Aquí surge un estado considerado en caso en donde un blanco es fijo, pero si fuese móvil, la situación cambia notablemente, porque a la situación de abatimiento se le sobrepondrá un deslizamiento Doppler (o, más correctamente, un efecto Doppler) que podrá causar un error de medición de la distancia: eso será si en el diagrama frecuencia-tiempo de la señal de eco se ubica por lo alto o por lo bajo.
Donde ahora que se encuentra con dos distintas frecuencias de abatimiento fb(up) =fr - fd, y fb(abajo) = fr+fd.
Se va a distinguir dos casos: sea fr > fd, la semisuma de fb(arriba) y fb(abajo) de fr, mientras la semidiferencia fd; se invierte fr < fd, la regla viene invertida: la semisuma de fd, y la semidiferencia fr.
En este modo se garantiza tanto la medida de la distancia del blanco en movimiento y la distinción de este último respecto de los otros.
Un uso militar de este radar es para ""iluminar"" blancos, y el misil hace blanco allí en el reflejo; a tn altas velocidades se necesita un retorno fuerte, y se logra con este tipo de radar.

301,"Shigenori Tōgō (Hioki, 10 de diciembre de 1882 – Tokio, 23 de julio de 1950) fue Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Japón desde el inicio y hasta el final del conflicto estadounidense-japonés de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. También desempeñó como Ministro de Asuntos Coloniales en 1941, siendo también Ministro de la Gran Asia Oriental en 1945.


== Biografía ==
Tōgō nació Hioki (Prefectura de Kagoshima), el 10 de diciembre de 1882. Hacia 1904 se había graduado en el departamento de Literatura de la Universidad Imperial de Tokio, titulación a la que siguieron sus estudios en Alemán en la Universidad Meiji. Entró a trabajar en el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores en 1912.


=== Carrera política ===
Tras el inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, a lo largo de la guerra Tōgō fue uno de los que dudaban de que el Japón podría tener éxito en una guerra con los Estados Unidos. Hacia el final de la contienda, fue uno de los principales impulsores por la aceptación de la Declaración de Potsdam, que, a su juicio, contenía las mejores condiciones de paz que a Japón se le podía ofrecer. Hasta el último momento, espero una respuesta positiva de la Unión Soviética y la respuesta oficial japonesa no se hizo a la declaración en un primer momento y una versión censurada dice que la propuesta de Tōgō fue dada a conocer al público japonés aunque Tōgō hubiera esperado oírla de Moscú. Lamentablemente, muchos dirigentes Aliados habían interpretado ese silencio (Mokusatsu, 黙殺) como un rechazo de la Declaración, y así se permitió que los bombardeos continuaran.
Tōgō fue uno de los Ministros del Gabinete japonés que, junto con el primer ministro Kantarō Suzuki, abogó por la rendición en el verano de 1945; Algunos días después de los bombardeos atómicos de Hiroshima y Nagasaki, esta acción se vio finalmente adoptada.
En la etapa decisiva de la guerra contra los Estados Unidos, relegó en otros la responsabilidad del fracaso de la diplomacia. Firmó el documento de la declaración de guerra y por su responsabilidad se convirtió en acusado en el Tribunal Penal Militar Internacional para el Lejano Oriente como un criminal de guerra, siendo condenado a 20 años de prisión, por los cargos de crímenes de guerra. Unos años después, en 1950, murió de colecistitis durante su confinamiento en la cárcel.


=== Familia ===
Tōgō en realidad era de ascendencia coreana y su apellido original era Park, un apellido coreano, su padre presuntamente compró el apellido, cuando Shigenori tenía cinco años.
El diplomático y profesor de relaciones internacionales Kazuhiko Tōgō es su nieto.

304,"La expedición británica al Everest de 1924 fue la segunda expedición organizada con el objetivo explícito de escalar la montaña más alta de la Tierra, el Monte Everest, tras la también británica de 1922. Tras dos primeros intentos de alcanzar la cima, Edward Norton estableció un nuevo récord de altitud en escalada. George Mallory y Andrew Irvine partieron para realizar un tercer intento, del que nunca regresaron. Desde entonces se especula con la posibilidad de que hubieran logrado alcanzar la cumbre, 29 años antes que Edmund Hillary y Tenzing Norgay. El cadáver de Mallory fue encontrado en 1999, aportando más elementos a las investigaciones, si bien no definitivos. Posteriormente, diversas expediciones han buscado el cuerpo de su compañero Irvine. Este portaba una cámara fotográfica cuyo contenido podría esclarecer definitivamente tanto si llegaron o no a la cima como las causas de que no volvieran con vida de su intento.


== Antecedentes ==
En los inicios del siglo XX sucesivas expediciones británicas habían fracasado en sus intentos de alcanzar ambos polos geográficos. Alcanzar el denominado ""tercer polo"", la cima del Everest, se convirtió en una cuestión de orgullo nacional.
El Everest se encuentra en la frontera entre Tíbet, al norte, y Nepal, al sur. Ambos países mantenían sus fronteras cerradas a los extranjeros hasta que en 1920 Tíbet abrió las suyas por primera vez desde 1850, al relajarse la situación internacional, especialmente con respecto a China.[1]​ Tíbet está situado en Asia Central, una región sobre la que el Reino Unido y Rusia ansiaban extender su influencia desde principios del siglo XIX, dando lugar a una rivalidad denominada por los británicos ""El Gran Juego"". Tras el anuncio de la apertura de fronteras por Tíbet, desde el Reino Unido se organizó sin dilación la primera de sus expediciones, que requerían complejas negociaciones por parte de la administración británica de la India ante el gobierno tibetano.

La principal desventaja de intentar escalar el Everest desde el lado norte partiendo desde la India es la larga marcha de aproximación que hay que realizar. Las expediciones, compuestas por escaladores, porteadores y animales como caballos, asnos y yaks (dependiendo del tipo de terreno y de lo que hubiera disponible) debían emprender el camino en cuanto el largo invierno del Himalaya lo permitiera. Dicha marcha se realizaba partiendo de Darjeeling, al norte de la India, en una zona muy cercana al Kangchenjunga. Se dirigían hacia territorio tibetano ascendiendo por los pasos situados al este de esta montaña para después recorrer el valle del río Arun hasta el valle del Rongbuk, que conduce a los pies de la cara norte del Everest. Los expedicionarios llegaban a ella (si todo había ido bien) a finales de abril. Hasta la primera semana de junio, cuando el monzón provoca fuertes precipitaciones en forma de nieve, tenían entre seis y ocho semanas para aclimatarse, instalar los campamentos de altura e intentar alcanzar la cima.


=== Las expediciones previas ===
La de 1924 era la tercera expedición británica, todas ellas organizadas y financiadas por el Mount Everest Committee, formado por la Royal Geographical Society y el Alpine Club para dicho fin, y que en esta ocasión contaron con la financiación adicional aportada por el capitán John Noel, fotógrafo y operador de cámara de la expedición, a cambio de los derechos sobre todas las imágenes tomadas en ella.[2]​ El Mount Everest Committee planteó las tres expediciones con una estrategia militar y contando con varios militares en cada una de ellas.
La primera, en 1921, había realizado durante diez semanas un reconocimiento exhaustivo de las caras este y norte de la montaña, cartografiándolas, así como sus alrededores. Harold Raeburn, líder de la expedición, propuso que la vía más favorable para escalar sería seguir toda la arista nordeste. Mallory, el único participante en las tres expediciones, había señalado entonces otra ruta, desde el collado norte por la arista norte hasta dicha arista nordeste y de allí hasta la cima. Tras encontrar un acceso al collado norte, desde el brazo este del Glaciar de Rongbuk, la ruta fue explorada con detalle. El 24 de septiembre él y Guy Bullock ascendieron hasta el collado norte, situado a 7020 msnm, confirmando dicha ruta como la más apropiada.[1]​ Casi más importante que la propia ruta fue establecer la primavera como la mejor época del año para intentar la escalada. Las siguientes expediciones intentarían la gesta entre el fin del invierno y el comienzo del monzón.
Un serio contratiempo fue el fallecimiento por enfermedad durante la marcha de aproximación de Alexander Kellas. Kellas, además de ser el escalador que probablemente más tiempo había permanecido por encima de los 6000 metros de altitud hasta entonces, era un experto en fisiología humana en altitud. El año anterior había desarrollado un estudio de las especiales condiciones que influían sobre el cuerpo humano al escalar en grandes altitudes, desarrollando rigurosos test sobre el uso de oxígeno suplementario en estas circunstancias.[3]​ Confiando en sus conocimientos, con la expedición viajaban botellas de oxígeno que tras la muerte de Kellas no fueron utilizadas.
No se utilizaron equipos de este tipo hasta la expedición de 1922 cuando, bajo la supervisión de George Finch, los escaladores tuvieron que experimentar diariamente con ellos, con desiguales resultados, hasta el punto de que varios de ellos renunciaron a su uso.[4]​[5]​ En esta expedición todos los intentos se realizaron por la vía descrita (y escalada en su inicio) por Mallory. La máxima altitud alcanzada fueron los 8326 m en que George Ingle Finch y Geoffrey Bruce se encontraban el 27 de mayo, cuando tuvieron que darse la vuelta debido al agotamiento y a problemas con los aparatos de oxígeno.


=== La preparación de la expedición ===
Los problemas financieros de la organización impidieron organizar una tercera expedición en 1923. En efecto, el Mount Everest Committee había perdido 700 libras (una gran cantidad de dinero para la época) en la quiebra del Simla Bank, así que la siguiente expedición tuvo que posponerse hasta 1924.[6]​[7]​
Mallory pasó el año 1923 de gira por Estados Unidos promoviendo la siguiente expedición. Allí, lejos del ambiente de Inglaterra, donde el Everest se había convertido en una cuestión nacional, Mallory se encontró con una opinión general que no comprendía la finalidad de una ascensión a la montaña más alta del mundo. Ante la pregunta de por qué escalarla, él se limitó a contestar: ""Porque está ahí"".[8]​
Un importante cambio con respecto a las expediciones anteriores fue la creciente importancia del papel de los porteadores. En la expedición de 1922 se había hecho evidente que muchos de ellos eran capaces de alcanzar grandes altitudes y de aprender rápidamente técnicas de escalada. Se inició entonces un cambio en las estrategias de las expediciones que implicaba una mayor participación de dichos porteadores, hasta que su aportación se situó en un nivel de igualdad con los escaladores foráneos. Este cambio culminó cuando Tenzing Norgay y Edmund Hillary alcanzaron la cima del Everest en condiciones de igualdad en la primera ascensión conocida. Con el paso del tiempo, la relación ""sahib - porteador"" de las primeras expediciones ha dado lugar a la relación ""profesional - cliente"" de las expediciones comerciales actuales, donde los sherpas son los escaladores más fuertes y los occidentales son clientes menos capaces y menos experimentados.[4]​
Esta expedición de 1924 llevó de nuevo consigo botellas de oxígeno. Este tipo de equipos se habían mejorado en los dos años transcurridos, pero aún estaban lejos de ser completamente fiables y no había una estrategia clara acerca de la idoneidad de usarlos. En realidad, no sólo se trataba de si realmente resultaban útiles, sino que se abrió un debate (que perdura hasta nuestros días) de si podían considerarse un medio honesto para escalar, lo que se definía por el término ""by fair means"" (por métodos limpios), enunciado por Mummery medio siglo antes.


== La segunda expedición ==


=== Participantes ===
El jefe de la expedición fue de nuevo el General Charles Granville Bruce, el mismo que lo fuera en la expedición precedente. Era el responsable del equipo y los abastecimientos, así como de contratar a los porteadores y elegir la ruta de acceso.
El Comité eligió el equipo de escaladores, lo cual no fue una decisión sencilla. Repitieron George Mallory, Howard Somervell, Edward ""Teddy"" Norton y Geoffrey Bruce. George Ingle Finch, uno de los escaladores más preparados para este tipo de expediciones, sino el que más, no fue incluido. La decisión se justificó en que se había divorciado y había dado conferencias pagadas. En realidad, algunos miembros del Comité, especialmente su influyente secretario Arthur Hinks, apercibidos de su capacidad, no querían que un australiano fuese el primero en llegar a la cumbre del Everest. Mallory entonces se negó a participar en la expedición si no iba Finch. Solo cambió de opinión tras ser persuadido por miembros de la familia real a petición de Hinks.[9]​

Varios de los finalmente elegidos no habían participado en ninguna de las dos expediciones anteriores, como Noel Odell, Bentley Beetham, John de Vere Hazard y Andrew ""Sandy"" Irvine. Este era un estudiante de ingeniería de 22 años recomendado por Odell. Había destacado en una expedición de escalada a la isla Spitsbergen, en el archipiélago Svalbard, organizado con el fin de buscar jóvenes con cualidades suficientes para integrarse en la expedición que intentara coronar el Everest. Irvine tuvo un comportamiento sobresaliente y, gracias a sus conocimientos técnicos, fue capaz de realizar reparaciones de equipos de todo tipo, incluyendo mejoras en los equipos de oxígeno.[10]​
La elección de los participantes no sólo se realizó teniendo en cuenta su capacidad como escaladores. Se valoró también el estatus de sus familias, el poseer estudios universitarios y, de forma muy especial, su experiencia militar.
La expedición estuvo finalmente compuesta por los siguientes miembros, además de un gran número de porteadores:


=== El viaje ===
A finales de febrero de 1924, Charles y Geoffrey Bruce, Norton y Shebbeare llegaron a Darjeeling. Su primera tarea fue elegir a los porteadores. Contrataron de nuevo a Karma Paul, nacido en Tíbet, como traductor, y a Gyalzen como ""sirdar"" o responsable de los porteadores. También se ocuparon de la adquisición de comida y material.
A finales de marzo ya habían llegado todos los miembros de la expedición y se pusieron en marcha. Siguieron la misma ruta que las dos expediciones anteriores. Para no exceder la capacidad de los lugares donde pernoctaban, viajaban en dos grupos con un día de marcha de diferencia. Llegaron a Yatung a principios de abril. El día 5 de ese mes se encontraban en Phari Dzong. Tras negociar con las autoridades tibetanas, el grupo principal siguió la ruta ya conocida hasta Kampa Dzong, mientras Charles Bruce dirigió un pequeño grupo por una ruta más sencilla.
Durante el viaje Bruce contrajo malaria y su estado empeoró hasta el punto de verse obligado a renunciar al mando de la expedición en favor de Norton. El 23 de abril la expedición llegó a Shekar Dzong y el 28 al Monasterio de Rongbuk, muy cerca ya de la ubicación elegida para el campamento base. El lama del monasterio se encontraba enfermo y no pudo atender a los expedicionarios ni realizar la ceremonia budista de la puyá. El día siguiente alcanzaron el final del glaciar de Rongbuk, donde instalarían el mencionado campamento base. Hasta ese momento las condiciones climatológicas habían sido buenas, pero una vez allí comenzó a nevar y a hacer frío.[7]​[12]​

De acuerdo con la ruta señalada por Mallory en 1921, la expedición ascendió por la rama este del Glaciar de Rongbuk. Desde allí ascenderían al collado norte para seguir dicha ruta. A una altura de 8605 metros sobre la arista nordeste les esperaba un formidable obstáculo: el ""segundo escalón"", una pared de 30 metros con una inclinación de 70°, rematada por un tramo vertical de casi siete metros. Sólo sería superado por la primera expedición en ascender al Everest por la cara norte, en 1960, y desde entonces se asciende por una escalera de mano. Pero en 1924 aún no eran conscientes de tal obstáculo. Una vez superado queda ascender por una arista de nieve de unos 45° de inclinación, que forma la pirámide de la cima y desde allí alcanzar la arista de la cima.


=== El establecimiento de los campamentos ===
La situación de los campamentos había sido decidida en la fase de preparación de la expedición. Se establecieron dos campamentos intermedios sobre el ramal este del glaciar de Rongbuk. El campamento I (5400 m) se levantó en la confluencia de este con el brazo principal del glaciar. El campamento II (6000 m) a medio camino entre el anterior y el campamento III (también ""campamento base avanzado"", a 6400 m), que a su vez se situaba a un kilómetro del comienzo de las rampas que conducen al collado norte.
Estos campamentos fueron equipados entre finales de abril y la primera semana de mayo por cerca de 150 porteadores que recibían un salario cercano a un chelín diario.
El mal tiempo detuvo en ese punto la actividad de la expedición.[7]​[13]​ El día 15 de ese mes los expedicionarios recibieron las bendiciones del lama del Monasterio de Rongbuk. El tiempo comenzó a mejorar y Norton, Mallory, Somervell y Odell se dirigieron al campamento III, al que llegaron el 19 de mayo. Al día siguiente comenzaron a instalar cuerdas fijas en dirección al collado norte. El día 21 establecieron el campamento IV sobre el collado norte, a 7000 m.[14]​
El tiempo empeoró de nuevo, aislando a John de Vere Hazard en el campamento IV con doce porteadores y pocos víveres. Este logró descender acompañado por ocho de los porteadores. Los otros cuatro, que no pudieron bajar por estar enfermos y sentirse débiles, fueron rescatados por Norton, Mallory y Somervell. Toda la expedición retornó al campamento I. Allí, los 15 porteadores más capaces fueron elegidos para acompañar a los escaladores británicos, adjudicándoles el calificativo de ""tigres"".[7]​[15]​


== Los intentos de alcanzar la cima ==

Norton, Mallory y Somervell quedaron agotados por el esfuerzo del rescate. En cuanto fue posible se decidió hacer dos intentos de atacar la cumbre.
El primer intento sería realizado por Mallory y Geoffrey Bruce, y el segundo por Somervell y Norton. Odell e Irvine prestarían apoyo a ambas cordadas desde el campamento IV, sobre el collado norte, mientras que Hazard haría lo propio desde el campamento III. Los tres constituían el equipo de reserva en previsión de un tercer intento. Los dos primeros intentos se realizaron sin bombonas de oxígeno.[7]​


=== El primer intento: Mallory y Bruce ===
El 1 de junio, Mallory, Bruce y nueve porteadores ""tigres"" salieron desde el campamento IV, situado en un espacio relativamente protegido a unos 50 metros bajo el collado norte. Cuando alcanzaron el collado y perdieron la protección del muro de hielo, comenzaron a soportar fuertes vientos. Cuatro de los porteadores tuvieron que abandonar antes de que pudieran instalar el campamento V, a 7700 metros. Mientras Mallory allanaba el terreno para instalar las tiendas, Bruce y otro de los porteadores retrocedían para recuperar las cargas que habían quedado abandonadas.
Al día siguiente, otros tres porteadores tuvieron que renunciar a continuar, y el intento quedó cancelado sin poder instalar el campamento VI, que estaba previsto a 8200 metros. De vuelta al campamento IV se encontraron con Norton y Somervell que iniciaban el segundo intento.[4]​[7]​


=== Segundo intento: Norton y Somervell ===
La segunda cordada partió al día siguiente de la primera, el día 2. Esto era una práctica habitual de las expediciones de la época, que permitía maximizar las posibilidades de éxito ante la imposibilidad de predecir la meteorología.[16]​ Estaba compuesta por Norton, Somervell y seis porteadores. Para ellos fue una sorpresa ver lo pronto que los miembros de la primera cordada habían tenido que ir dándose la vuelta. Norton y Somervell ascendían con inquietud, preguntándose si los porteadores que les acompañaban podrían continuar más allá del campamento V. Efectivamente, dos de ellos tuvieron que darse la vuelta y regresar al campamento base avanzado. Los demás pasaron la noche en el campamento V. Al día siguiente, tres de los porteadores cargaron con el material necesario para establecer el campamento VI a 8170 metros de altitud en un pequeño nicho. De común acuerdo, los porteadores regresaron al campamento IV.
El 4 de junio, Norton y Somervell se pusieron en marcha a las 6:40, algo más tarde de lo previsto. Les retrasó el derrame de una botella de agua, que les obligó a derretir algo más de nieve. De cualquier forma, el litro de agua que cada escalador tomaba antes de iniciar la jornada era una cantidad totalmente inadecuada.[17]​ El tiempo era perfecto. Ascendieron 200 metros por la arista norte y decidieron continuar atravesando diagonalmente la Cara Norte. Al no utilizar oxígeno suplementario, se veían forzados a detenerse con frecuencia para recuperar el aliento.
Cerca del mediodía Somervell ya no fue capaz de continuar más. Norton continuó solo hasta alcanzar el profundo surco que asciende hacia la parte oriental de la base de la pirámide que conforma la cima de la montaña. Este surco, que denominaron ""Gran Corredor"", hoy en día se conoce como Corredor Norton. Mientras escalaba por una empinada pendiente helada con algunas secciones de nieve, Norton fue fotografiado por Somervell. Se encontraba muy cerca del máximo punto alcanzado (8573 m), altitud que constituyó un récord absoluto durante 28 años, hasta que en 1952 Raymond Lambert y Tenzing Norgay alcanzaron los 8611 m sobre la cara sur del Everest.[18]​
Norton se encontraba a sólo 60 metros bajo el pie de la pirámide de la cima, más fácil de escalar que el tramo que estaba escalando, cuando decidió regresar debido a la creciente dificultad del terreno y a lo avanzado de la hora. Se reunió con Somervell a las 14:00 y descendieron juntos. Somervell sufrió durante el descenso un extraño bloqueo de su garganta, que le impedía respirar, hasta el punto que pensó que iba a morir. Sentado en el suelo, comprimió con fuerza sus pulmones con sus brazos y logró salir de la situación. Cuando se recuperó, siguió a Norton, que no se había percatado de nada y le sacaba media hora de ventaja.
Descendieron hasta el campamento IV, a pesar de que desde que sobrepasaron el campamento V estaba oscureciendo. Cuando llegaron a él, Mallory les ofreció oxígeno, pero su deseo más imperioso era beber. Durante la noche, Mallory expuso a Norton sus planes de realizar el siguiente intento acompañado por Irvine y con oxígeno suplementario.[4]​[7]​


=== El tercer intento: Mallory e Irvine ===
Era el turno de la siguiente cordada. Mallory, que ya tenía 38 años, sabía que esta era su última oportunidad de escalar el techo del mundo. Así lo revelan sus anotaciones mientras se acercaban a la montaña:

""La suerte está echada. De nuevo por última vez avanzamos por el glaciar de Rongbuk en pos de la victoria o de la derrota final""

Mientras Somervell y Norton ascendían en el segundo intento, Mallory y Bruce habían descendido hasta el campamento base avanzado (también llamado ABC, del inglés ""Advanced Base Camp"", o campamento III). Allí recogieron botellas de oxígeno y ascendieron de nuevo al campamento IV. Mallory eligió a Irvine como compañero de cordada para el siguiente intento debido a su gran conocimiento de los equipos de oxígeno, y también porque, desde que compartieran el barco camino a India, Mallory confiaba en él completamente, llegando a describirle como ""fuerte como un buey"". Norton no quiso discutirle su decisión, a pesar de la inexperiencia de Irvine en escalada a grandes altitudes.
El día 5 permanecieron aún en el campamento IV. A las 8:40 del día 6 se pusieron en marcha con cinco porteadores y durmieron en el campamento V. El día 7 ascendieron al campamento VI (8170 m), mientras Odell y Hazard ascendían hasta el campamento V como equipo de apoyo. Poco después de llegar a él, llegaron también los porteadores, que descendían tras cumplir su misión. Llevaban un mensaje de Mallory para Odell con la hora estimada en que esperaban llegar a la arista, si elegían ese camino, o estar cruzando hacia el ""Gran Corredor"", si finalmente optaban por este. Era el siguiente:

Querido Noel Probablemente empezaremos pronto mañana (día 8) para aprovechar el buen tiempo. No será demasiado pronto para intentar vernos desde tu posición, ya sea cruzando la banda de rocas bajo la pirámide o ascendiendo por el horizonte [sobre la arista], alrededor de las 8.0 p.m.Siempre tuyo G Mallory

(Mallory en realidad quería decir las 8:00 a.m.).[4]​[19]​
El día 8 de junio, Odell comenzó a ascender desde el campamento V para hacer estudios geológicos, su especialidad. La montaña se hallaba envuelta en bruma, así que apenas podía ver la arista nordeste, la ruta que finalmente eligieron Mallory e Irvine. A las 12:50 Odell se encontraba sobre un grupo de rocas a 7900 m cuando se abrió un claro en la bruma y pudo ver a sus dos compañeros.[20]​ Esta fue la última vez que se les vio con vida y, por desgracia, Odell nunca pudo asegurar exactamente dónde se encontraban cuando los vio, pues desde su posición no podía ver toda la arista. Para colmo, con el paso del tiempo, Odell cambió varias veces el relato de lo que había visto. La opinión inicial de Odell fue que los dos escaladores habían alcanzado la base del segundo escalón.[21]​ Le preocupaba que si era así ambos acumulaban cinco horas de retraso con respecto a las previsiones.
Odell continuó ascendiendo hasta el campamento VI, que encontró en desorden. Hacia las 14:00 se desató una intensa borrasca acompañada de nieve. Odell salió fuera con la intención de orientar a sus compañeros, en el caso previsto de que estuvieran descendiendo. Gritó y silbó para indicarles la posición de la tienda. Después se refugió en ella hasta que la tormenta pasó, alrededor de las 16:00 horas. Inspeccionó entonces la montaña en busca de los dos escaladores, sin ver nada.
Como la tienda solo podía acoger a dos personas, Odell la abandonó a las 16:30 y descendió hasta el campamento IV, a donde llegó a las 18:45 horas. El siguiente día transcurrió sin noticias, así que Odell ascendió otra vez, acompañado de dos porteadores. Sobre las 15:30 llegaron al campamento V y pasaron allí la noche. Al día siguiente Odell subió en solitario al campamento VI, que encontró exactamente igual a como lo había dejado. Siguió ascendiendo hasta 8200 metros aproximadamente, sin encontrar ningún rastro de sus compañeros. De vuelta al campamento VI, colocó dos sacos de dormir en el exterior formando una T, una señal convenida, visible desde el campamento base avanzado, para indicar «ninguna señal, sin esperanzas, a la espera de órdenes». Después descendió hasta el campamento IV.
La mañana del 11 de junio comenzaron a descender las rampas heladas del collado norte para abandonar la montaña. Cinco días más tarde se despedían del lama del Monasterio de Rongbuk.[4]​[7]​


== Tras la expedición ==
Los participantes en la expedición colocaron un montículo de piedras[22]​ en honor a los desaparecidos de aquellas tres expediciones de 1921, 1922 y 1924.[23]​ Mallory e Irvine se convirtieron en héroes nacionales. Uno de los patios del Magdalene College, donde Mallory había estudiado, recibió su nombre y en él se erigió un monolito en su honor. En la Universidad de Oxford, donde Irvine estudiaba, se erigió otro en el suyo.[24]​ Se celebró una ceremonia funeraria en la Catedral de San Pablo de Londres, a la que acudió el rey Jorge V y otros dignatarios.[25]​
El Dalai Lama no dio un nuevo permiso para otra expedición hasta 1933.


== ¿El primer ascenso al Everest? ==


=== El relato de Odell ===
Gran parte de las especulaciones sobre si Irvine y Mallory alcanzaron o no la cumbre se centran en la posición en que se encontraban cuando fueron vistos por Odell. Este anotó en su diario que vio a Mallory e Irvine justo bajo la arista nordeste cuando alcanzaban la base del segundo escalón y que vio como lo superaban (en unos 5 minutos). Tras ello les vio supuestamente ""acercándose a la base de la pirámide final (sic)"".[20]​[26]​ El primer parte de expedición que redactó describía su posición de similar forma: ""[en un] prominente escalón rocoso a muy poca distancia de la base de la pirámide final"".[27]​
En un primer informe escrito el 5 de julio para The Times escribió que desde su posición veía la cima, la pirámide final y la arista desde la posición de los escaladores hasta la cima. Que vio un pequeño punto negro (uno de los escaladores) moviéndose sobre la nieve bajo el segundo escalón y otro segundo punto negro avanzando tras él. Por último, que vio al primer escalador alcanzar ""la cresta de la arista"" (""broke skyline""), pero que no podía asegurar que el segundo también lo hubiera hecho.[28]​
Las afirmaciones de Odell acerca del avistamiento de Irvine y Mallory fueron pronto puestas en discusión. Muchos pensaban (y aún hoy muchos) que con los materiales y las técnicas de escalada de aquella época no era posible superar el segundo escalón. La mayoría que, siendo escalable o no, lo que no era posible era hacerlo en los cinco minutos en que Odell vio a los escaladores superar un obstáculo similar, y que Odell seguramente vio a Irvine y Mallory ascendiendo el Primer Escalón, mucho más sencillo de superar. Tras la expedición, Odell se mostró en privado convencido de que habían alcanzado la cumbre. Sin embargo, bajo la presión del mundo de la escalada Odell varió su relato varias veces.
La narración de Odell sobre la situación meteorológica también varió. Al principio, afirmó que podía ver toda la arista y la cima. Más tarde, dijo que la bruma solo dejaba ver una parte de la arista.
Tras ver las fotografías hechas por la expedición de 1933, Odell de nuevo insistió en que había visto a los dos alpinistas superar el segundo escalón. Finalmente, en 1986 admitió que desde 1924 nunca había tenido claro en qué punto exacto de la arista había visto aquellos dos puntos negros.[4]​
Odell relató lo que vio en los campamentos V y VI. Entre los objetos que encontró estaban la brújula de Mallory, que se consideraba un elemento importante a la hora de escalar, y algunas bombonas de oxígeno y piezas del equipamiento necesario para utilizarlas.[29]​ Esto parece indicar que hubo algún problema con dicho equipamiento, y que este problema pudo haber causado que partieran con retraso en su intento de cima.
Odell también encontró una lámpara eléctrica, que aún funcionaba cuando la expedición de Hugh Ruttledge la encontró nueve años más tarde.


=== Las investigaciones posteriores ===
Harris y Wager, participantes en la mencionada expedición británica de 1933 encontraron el piolet de Irvine a unos 230 metros hacia el este del Primer Escalón y unos 20 metros bajo la arista. Es una zona poco peligrosa, donde es poco probable que Irvine sufriera una caída, pero que abandonara una herramienta imprescindible para la escalada es simplemente impensable.
Wang Hong, participante en el segundo ascenso de una expedición china al Everest, llevado a cabo en 1975, dijo después haber visto ""un inglés muerto"" a unos 8100 m. Esta noticia nunca fue hecha pública oficialmente, pero en 1986 se lanzó una expedición para buscar los restos de Irvine y Mallory basada en esta información. Tuvo que cancelarse prematuramente, debido al mal tiempo.
Una reciente teoría del investigador Tom Holzel sugiere que los dos escaladores en realidad se encontraban descendiendo tras renunciar a la cima y que ascendieron una pequeña elevación para tomar fotografías de la ruta que quedaba por recorrer, muy útiles para posteriores intentos.[30]​
En 1999 el investigador del Everest Jochen Hemmleb organizó una nueva expedición de búsqueda, liderada por Eric Simonson. Simonson había encontrado, durante su primer ascenso al Everest, en 1991, bombonas de oxígeno muy antiguas cerca del Primer Escalón. Una de ellas fue encontrada de nuevo en 1999 y se comprobó que fue usada por Irvine o Mallory en su intento de ascensión. Su ubicación allí podría sugerir que escalaron a una velocidad aproximada de 80 metros verticales por hora. Un ritmo muy bueno, que indicaría que los aparatos de oxígeno funcionaban correctamente. La expedición intentó también encontrar la posición en la que Odell se hallaba cuando avistó a Irvine y Mallory. El montañero Andy Politz comentó que, desde la que pensaban que era la más probable, era posible distinguir sin problemas los tres ""escalones"" con tiempo despejado.
El hallazgo más destacado de la expedición fue, sin duda, el cuerpo de Mallory a una altitud de 8159 m. El examen del cuerpo indicaba que no había sufrido una caída larga. Alrededor de su cintura era claramente visible la marca de la cuerda que le unía a Irvine durante la escalada, y que mostraba que aún estaban encordados cuando cayeron. Tenía la pierna derecha fracturada y una brecha en la frente del tamaño de una pelota de golf. La pierna izquierda se hallaba sobre la derecha, lo que se interpretó como un gesto de protección y que, por tanto, que estaba consciente después de la caída. Pero el doctor Elliot Schwamm, neurocirujano del Hospital General de Massachusetts, afirmó que era imposible que siguiera consciente tras la herida de la frente. No había ningún equipo de oxígeno cerca, lo que indica que ya habían agotado (y abandonado) aquellos con los que partieron. Tampoco tenía puestas sus gafas de sol, que se hallaban en su bolsillo, lo que parece indicar que descendía de noche. No llevaba consigo la fotografía de su mujer, Ruth, que él había prometido que dejaría en la cima, lo que podría interpretarse como una evidencia de que había llegado a la misma. Pero la única prueba determinante de que tal cosa ocurriera sólo puede estar dentro de la cámara de fotos que portaban, si es que aún se conserva el carrete en suficiente buen estado como para revelarlo. Pero la cámara no fue encontrada entre la ropa de Mallory.[4]​[19]​


=== ¿Un equipamiento inadecuado? ===
Un argumento contrario a la posibilidad de que Irvine y Mallory alcanzaran la cumbre del Everest es el de que su ropa y calzado eran inadecuados. Cuando se encontró el cuerpo de Mallory, en 1999, la expedición volvió al Reino Unido con el equipo que pudo recuperar del cadáver, incluyendo fragmentos de ropa. Esta fue estudiada por cuatro equipos de trabajo de las universidades de Southampton, Derby, Leeds y Lancaster. Tras casi tres años de intensivo análisis, los investigadores fueron capaces de recrear completamente la vestimenta de Mallory, hasta el menor detalle, como el tipo de puntada en los tejidos de lana. La ropa estaba compuesta de lana, seda y algodón y sorprendió por su ligereza, especialmente las botas, que fueron consideradas por el equipo de investigadores como ""las más ligeras usadas nunca en el Everest"".
En 2006 Graham Hoyland, sobrino-nieto de Howard Somervell, ascendió hasta los 6400 metros vistiendo esta reproducción de la ropa que vestía Mallory. Sus concusiones eran que, hasta esa altitud, había funcionado muy bien y que resultaba bastante confortable. Según Hoyland, eran ""perfectamente adecuadas para un intento de cima"".[31]​
En 2008 esta réplica fue enviada a la Universidad de Loughborough, donde el profesor George Havenith, experto en termorregulación humana, calculó su capacidad de aislamiento y protección contra el viento. Observó que la capacidad de aislamiento de las ropas de Mallory era solo levemente inferior a las bastante más pesadas que vestían tanto Amundsen como Scott en sus expediciones al Polo Sur en 1911, pero un 40% inferior al aislamiento que proporciona la ropa utilizada hoy en día. Concluyó que hubieran permitido a Mallory e Irvine alcanzar la cumbre con buen tiempo, incluso con temperaturas de -30°C, pero que no hubieran sobrevivido a un deterioro de las condiciones meteorológicas como el observado por Odell por la tarde.[32]​


=== El Segundo Escalón ===
El relato de Odell a la vista de los conocimientos actuales hace pensar que el que Mallory e Irvine pudieran superar el Segundo Escalón es muy poco probable. Su dificultad técnica lo hace imposible de escalar a la velocidad descrita por Odell. Solo el Primer y el Tercer Escalón pueden ser escalados con rapidez. Odell dijo haberles visto al pie de la pirámide de la cima, lo que descartaría que se tratara del Primer Escalón, pero tampoco parece probable que ambos se pusieran en marcha lo bastante pronto y al suficiente ritmo como para alcanzar el Tercer Escalón a las 12:50 del mediodía. Ambas dificultades se encuentran lo bastante alejadas como para que resulte difícil confundirlas. Una nueva posibilidad fue apuntada por Eric Shipton en 1933, cuando una pareja de pájaros fue confundida, en la distancia, con escaladores. Shipton especula con que lo mismo hubiera podido sucederle a Odell, y que los dos ""puntos negros"" que vio hubieran sido pájaros.
Volviendo a la dificultad técnica del paso y a la posibilidad de que Mallory e Irvine lo superaran es destacable que no existe la seguridad de que haya sido superado en escalada libre hasta que lo hiciera Óscar Cadiach en 1985. Tras ello, Cadiach valoró su dificultad como V+. La mencionada expedición de Conrad Anker intentó repetirlo en 1999, pero no pudieron hacer un ascenso completo en libre al haber hecho un apoyo en la escalera que permite superar el tramo en un punto concreto en que esta bloqueaba el único apoyo posible. Anker valoró el tramo como de dificultad 5.10, por encima de la capacidad técnica que se le supone hoy en día a Mallory. En junio de 2007, Anker volvió como miembro de la Altitude Everest Expedition 2007 y logró superar el Segundo Escalón junto con Leo Houlding, tras ser retirada la escalera (reemplazada posteriormente).[33]​ Houlding valoró en 5.9 su dificultad, más cerca de las posibilidades de Mallory. Theo Fritsche logró escalar el tramo en libre de nuevo en 2001 y lo clasificó como V+.


=== ¿Una hora demasiado tardía? ===
Un argumento en contra de la posibilidad de que Irvine y Mallory alcanzaran la cima es el largo camino que la separa del campamento VI, desde el que se parte para alcanzarla. En condiciones normales, incluso hoy en día, no es posible alcanzar dicha cima antes del anochecer si se parte con las primeras luces del día. No fue hasta 1990 cuando Ed Viesturs lo consiguiera partiendo desde una distancia similar, con la diferencia de que Viesturs conocía la ruta, mientras que para Irvine y Mallory era completamente desconocida.
A todo esto hay que sumarle que la inexperiencia de Irvine muy probablemente hubiera llevado a Mallory a no asumir más riesgos de los estrictamente necesarios, como es el escalar a una hora tan tardía que obligue a regresar de noche.
Los escaladores que hoy en día toman una ruta hacia la cumbre similar a la que intentaron Mallory e Irvine salen a media noche desde una altura cercana a los 8300 metros. Esto les permite regresar en el mismo día y evitar los riesgos de descender de noche con las fuerzas ya muy mermadas, o de tener que hacer un aún más arriesgado vivac sin la protección de una tienda.
Durante las escaladas nocturnas se utilizan lámparas frontales, una tecnología que no estaba disponible en 1924.

310,"La garganta de Navalíshchina (en ruso, Навали́шинское уще́лье; Navalíshchinskoye ushchelie) es un cañón situado en el curso medio del Bolshaya Josta, formado al atravesar éste la cordillera de Ajún. Está situado en el territorio administrativo del distrito de Josta de la unidad municipal de la ciudad de Sochi, en el krai de Krasnodar del sur de Rusia.
Tiene una longitud de 1 500 m. En las laderas del cañón crecen árboles relictos, como el tejo y el boj. En la ladera próxima del monte Ajún, se halla la ""Arboleda del Tejo y el Boj"". Su nombre deriva del apellido del propietario de las tierras del área circundante, Navalíshina. En las cercanías se halla la fortaleza de Josta.

311,"Andrés Pazos (Buenos Aires, octubre de 1765 - íd., agosto de 1849) fue un comerciante y político argentino, organizador de la villa de La Bajada, actualmente la ciudad de Paraná, capital de la provincia de Entre Ríos.


== Biografía ==
Era un comerciante especializado en el transporte por el río Paraná, y se estableció en la Bajada del Paraná, actual Ciudad de Paraná, que hasta entonces era jurisdicción de la ciudad de Santa Fe. A fines del régimen virreinal fue uno de los promotores de la petición para que el pueblo de La Bajada se constituyera en villa, es decir, que tuviera su cabildo propio.
En 1810 prestó eficaz ayuda a la Expedición al Paraguay comandada por Manuel Belgrano. A fines del año siguiente, también colaboró en la formación de nuevos contingentes para el ejército que debía hacer frente a los avances de los realistas de Montevideo. En mayo de 1812 fue nombrado alcalde de la villa de La Bajada y capitán del cuerpo de pardos y cívicos de la misma. Hizo frente al bloqueo de la villa por la flota española y a varios desembarcos de las fuerzas realistas, cuya principal preocupación era conseguir alimentos para la ciudad sitiada de Montevideo. En agosto de ese año capturó una flotilla que bajaba desde el Paraguay.
Gracias a sus esfuerzos, el pueblo alcanzó notoriedad, y fue ascendido a la categoría de villa el 25 de junio de 1813. A partir del 1 de octubre de 1813 Pazos fue el primer alcalde de primer voto de la villa y su primer comandante militar en la nueva época. Tuvo que dedicar todos sus esfuerzos a enfrentar a la poderosa familia santafesina de los Larramendi, propietarios de extensas tierras cerca del pueblo, que pretendían cercarlo y cerrarle todos los caminos. Delineó el pueblo y ordenó sus primeras calles.
En 1814, al iniciarse la guerra entre Artigas y el Directorio, su principal campo de batalla fue la provincia de Entre Ríos. Pazos renunció a sus cargos y en marzo de ese año se trasladó a Santa Fe. Al año siguiente la guerra se extendió también a esa provincia, por lo que regresó a Buenos Aires.
Se dedicó al comercio en la capital durante muchos años, y evitó en lo posible la acción política; no obstante, tuvo una figuración secundaria durante la Anarquía del Año XX.
En 1840, tras la invasión del general Lavalle, fue arrestado y perseguido por La Mazorca, la organización parapolicial del gobernador Juan Manuel de Rosas; su casa fue saqueada.
Falleció en Buenos Aires en agosto de 1849.

313,"Gorriones de la Catedral de Ratisbona (en alemán: Regensburger Domspatzen) es el coro de la catedral de Ratisbona, en Baviera. Constituido por niños y jóvenes, cuenta con una historia de más de mil años y es uno de los coros de niños más antiguos del mundo. En 2002, la Federación Europea de Coros le concedió el título de «Embajadores Culturales de Europa». Además, son embajadores de UNICEF.


== Historia ==
Según la leyenda, la historia del coro de Ratisbona se remonta al siglo VII. Puede demostrarse que el obispo Wolfgang de Ratisbona fundó en 975 una escuela catedralicia centrada en la formación musical para conformar la música en la liturgia. La andadura del conjunto vocal sufrió una breve interrupción durante la Guerra de los Treinta Años, cuando el Seminario se cerró por un tiempo.
A comienzos del siglo XX, el coro de la catedral de Ratisbona, bajo la dirección de Franz Xaver Engelhardt, emprendió su primer viaje de conciertos (a Praga). Por entonces aún no había nacido la denominación de ""gorriones de la catedral"" (Domspatzen). Gracias sobre todo a la actividad de Theobald Schrems, (maestro de capilla desde 1924 hasta 1963), el coro adquirió fama mundial. Así, por ejemplo, se emprendió una gira a Sudamérica en 1937, con actuaciones en São Paulo y Montevideo).
Georg Ratzinger, hermano del papa Benedicto XVI, fue maestro de capilla entre los años 1964 y 1994 y continuó con esta carrera de éxitos. Desde 1994 dirige el coro Roland Büchner, quien continuó desarrollando las interpretaciones de grandes obras corales como El Mesías de Händel, La creación de Haydn, la Pasión según San Mateo y la Pasión según San Juan de Bach. Los Domspatzen emprendieron bajo su dirección numerosas giras internacionales, como por ejemplo a Japón, Kuwait, Sudáfrica, Filipinas, Francia, Portugal, Escocia, Italia, Hungría, Ciudad del Vaticano, Austria, Suiza, Bélgica y Eslovaquia, entre otros países.


== Organización ==
Los Regensburger Domspatzen son una fusión entre el Coro de la catedral de Ratisbona y la escuela de canto de dicha ciudad. Esta estructura organizativa fue creada por Theobald Schrems tras la II Guerra Mundial. El colegio, el internado y el coro se encuentran en un mismo edificio, lo cual supone las mejores condiciones institucionales para la calidad de su trabajo y disminuye el estrés de los cantantes.
El 15 de julio de 1925 fue fundada la asociación ""Amigos del Coro de la Catedral de Ratisbona"", que fomenta a los Domspatzen. La misma finalidad tiene también la ""Fundación Cultural de los Gorriones de la Catedral de Ratisbona"".
Los jóvenes cantores estudian en un instituto propio, un centro de formación lingüística y humanística. En total asisten a estas tres instituciones (coro, colegio e internado) alrededor de 500 ""gorriones"".


== Varios ==
Los Domspatzen publicaron en otoño de 2005 un álbum en el que puede oírse el concierto para el papa Benedicto XVI. Alcanzó el puesto 86 de los Deutsche Album-Charts y el 5 del Klassik Charts. El concierto se interpretó en la Capilla Sixtina, bajo la dirección del maestro de capilla Roland Büchner.

314,"Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, inicialmente llamada Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, fue fundada por Leo Fender en la década de 1940 y es una de las más conocidas empresas fabricantes de guitarras y bajos eléctricos.
Fender es particularmente conocida por llevar las guitarras eléctricas de cuerpo macizo a las masas. Fender creó la primera guitarra eléctrica de cuerpo sólido de venta masiva, la Telecaster (originalmente llamada 'Broadcaster'; 'Esquire' es el modelo original con una sola pastilla), el primer bajo de producción masiva, el Precision Bass o 'P-Bass', y la mundialmente conocida Stratocaster o Strat.
Otras compañías y luthiers fabricaban guitarras eléctricas, pero todas eran de cuerpo hueco o guitarras especiales, como la Lap Steel hawaiana de Rickenbacker.
Otros modelos conocidos de Fender son las guitarras Mustang, Jazzmaster, Fender Jaguar, Musicmaster y Duo-Sonic y los bajos Jazz Bass, Precision, Mustang Bass y Bajo Telecaster, una línea de lap steels y el famoso piano eléctrico Fender Rhodes. Además de esto, también fabrica amplificadores de guitarra como el Twin Reverb o el Jazz Junior.
Su jefatura está en Scottsdale, Arizona, y posee instalaciones en Corona (California), Japón, Ensenada, México y Corea.


== Comienzos de Fender ==
La compañía comenzó con el nombre de 'Fender's Radio Service' en 1938, en Fullerton, California. Como técnico calificado en electrónica, Leo Fender era contratado no sólo para reparar radios, sino también fonolas, sistemas de audio particulares y amplificadores. Como fruto de su trabajo, Fender se intrigó por los pequeños fallos en los amplificadores de esa época y comenzó a construir sus propios modelos y a modificar los ya existentes.
A comienzos de la década de 1940 se unió a otro entusiasta de la electrónica, Clayton Orr Kauffman, creando una compañía llamada 'K y F Manufacturing Corp.' para diseñar, fabricar y vender sus propios instrumentos musicales y amplificadores. La producción comenzó en 1945, construyendo guitarras Lap Steel hawaianas (con un modelo de pastilla patentada) y amplificadores. Antes de fin de año Fender se convenció de que era más provechoso fabricar que reparar guitarras eléctricas, y se dedicó completamente a esta labor. Kauffman no se mostraba muy convencido de esta decisión y a comienzos de 1946 ambos decidieron amistosamente seguir sus respectivos caminos. Leo decidió entonces renombrar a la empresa 'Fender Electric Instrument Company'. La tienda de reparación siguió abierta hasta 1951, aunque Fender no atendía personalmente desde 1947.


== La venta a CBS ==
En 1965, a Leo Fender se le diagnosticó una enfermedad grave y se le pronosticó, erróneamente, un escaso tiempo vida. Leo decidió vender entonces su compañía a la Columbia Broadcasting System o CBS.
La venta de Fender a CBS tiene varias implicaciones de gran importancia. La venta a CBS fue vista en su momento como un hecho positivo, pues esta empresa podía proveer de dinero y empleados a Fender. Sin embargo, ahora se ve como un hecho desfavorable, porque se piensa que CBS sobrepuso la cantidad a la calidad. El culmen de esta tendencia se vio en 1983, cuando CBS realizó unos reajustes desfavorables al modelo Stratocaster, quitándose el segundo control de tono. Además, otros modelos previos, como el Swinger (modelo de gama baja que puede estar compuesto por varias partes encoladas, a diferencia de la Stratocaster normal, que es una guitarra de cuerpo macizo, obtenido a partir de una sola pieza de madera, aunque en las dos el mástil va unido mediante atornillado) y el Custom (uno de los modelos en el que se recurre al encolado), resultaron únicamente intentos de conseguir ganancias extra.
Se optó por tiempos de secado más cortos para las maderas empleadas en los cuerpos de los instrumentos y éstos los formaban varias piezas encoladas en lugar de una sola, lo que repercutía no sólo en el timbre y la estabilidad de la guitarra, sino también en su peso, que era mucho mayor, haciéndolas incómodas.
La compañía dejó de emplear pastillas de fabricación propia, optando por modelos baratos y de inferior calidad, lo cual también es aplicable a otras piezas. Los puentes, que antes se fabricaban con acero o bronce prensado (lo cual prestaba mayor sonoridad y solidez al instrumento), pasaron a construirse con aleaciones más maleables, y, por tanto, menos resistentes al desgaste. Es muy común encontrarse instrumentos de esta época en los que muchas partes no son originales, ya que éstas los hacían ""intocables"". Fue precisamente en la década de 1970 cuando surgió una gran industria de recambios para guitarras eléctricas, como Warmoth, Schaller o Gotoh.
Debido a situaciones como éstas se generó un culto al 'Pre-CBS', buscando los modelos fabricados antes de la compra de la empresa. Esta respondió ofreciendo diseños que trataban de imitar las características propias de guitarras de la competencia, como es el caso de la Telecaster Deluxe, que buscaba un hueco en el sector de mercado de Gibson con sus pastillas dobles, y, en ciertos modelos, cuerpos huecos. Todo ello no hizo, en realidad, sino diluir los rasgos más evidentes y renombrados de la marca, devaluándola en gran medida.
Después de la venta de Fender y tras evidenciarse el error del pronóstico sobre su salud, Leo Fender diseñó productos para Music Man, para fundar más tarde G&L company junto a George Fullerton, dedicada a la fabricación de guitarras y bajos de su creación.


== Actualidad ==
En 1985, por iniciativa de un empleado de la fábrica, Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company fue comprada a la CBS por sus propios trabajadores y renombrada como 'Fender Musical Instrument Corporation'.
La Fender Musical Instruments Corporation ha continuado creciendo, agregando nuevos productos a su catálogo y conservando los diseños originales de los comienzos de la compañía. En 1987 abrieron una nueva fábrica en la ciudad de Ensenada (Baja California) debido al favorable clima y la mano de obra de buena calidad a bajo costo.
Fender fabrica sus modelos de más alta calidad en Estados Unidos, México y Japón, pero también tiene extensas instalaciones de fabricación en China e Indonesia para los modelos de menor calidad, de tal manera que hoy en día se puede comprar una Fender Stratocaster al mismo precio en dólares que en 1954. Los modelos más antiguos y los construidos en Estados Unidos son los más buscados, pero los japoneses también son muy apreciados. Debido a esto, las Fender construidas en Ensenada, México, reemplazan en el mercado americano a las japonesas y las Fender construidas en Japón se distribuyen únicamente dentro de este país, siendo muy pocas exportadas.
La marca Squier (una fábrica de cuerdas comprada por Fender) se encarga de las guitarras de estudio desde la década de 1980. El nombre reúne a las guitarras de menor precio, con diseños originales de Fender, pero de construcción más barata. Estos modelos de menor coste son fabricados en China e Indonesia, pero eran originalmente fabricadas en Corea y Japón.
Los antiguos modelos japoneses de Fender y Squier Stratocaster son muy apreciados y se venden en el mercado de los usados como JV o 'Japanese Vintage'.
La base de su línea de instrumentos, conformada por la Tele, la Strat, el P-Bass y el J-Bass, permanece sin cambios con respecto a los modelos de la década de 1950. En cualquier género musical, ya sea rock, pop, blues o country, es muy probable que se vea una guitarra o bajo Fender amplificado por un amplificador de la misma marca. Las guitarras Fender son o han sido utilizadas por un gran número de artistas conocidos, entre los que destacan Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, Ritchie Blackmore, Keith Richards, David Gilmour, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Paul Mccartney, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, John Lennon, Pete Townshend, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Yngwie Malmsteen, Deryck Whibley, John Frusciante o Kurt Cobain, entre otros.
Asimismo, Fender fabrica guitarras acústicas y guitarras electroacústicas como las Stratacoustic y Telecoustic, basadas en sus diseños clásicos Stratocaster y Telecaster respectivamente, usando nuevos materiales como la fibra de carbono. Además lanzó reediciones de pedales de efectos fabricados entre la década de 1960 y 1970, impulsados por la alta demanda que los modelos originales tenían y la dificultad para conseguirlos debido a su rareza. También ha comprado distintas empresas de guitarras como Gretsch, Guild, Hamer, Jackson, Charvel, Tacoma y otras marcas como la SWR de amplificadores para bajos.

315,"Río Rewa (en inglés: Rewa River;[1]​ en hindi de Fiyi: Rewa Naddi) es el río más ancho del país insular de Fiyi. Situado en la isla de Viti Levu, el Rewa se origina en Tomanivi, el pico más alto en Fiyi, y fluye al sureste de 145 km hasta la bahía de Laucala, cerca de Suva. El río Rewa drena aproximadamente una tercera parte de la isla de Viti Levu.
El río Rewa es alimentado por dos grandes afluentes, el Wainibuka y Wainimala y se une con otros ríos de importancia antes de llegar al mar por un delta de muchas bocas. Es navegable por pequeñas embarcaciones hasta 100 kilómetros desde su desembocadura y su cuenca se enriquece con un suelo con depósitos profundos aluviales. Hay más de 200 pueblos nativos situados en sus orillas.[2]​ El río Rewa es atravesado por el puente de Rewa en Nausori.

Está dirigida por Jonathan Frakes, producida por Gale Anne Hurd y Julia Pistor, y escrita por Rob Hedden, Andy Hedden, J. David Stem y David N. Weiss.


== Sinopsis ==
Zack Gibbs es un joven que ya tiene edad para conducir y, como la mayoría de los chicos de su edad, desea tener su propio coche. Para conseguirlo, busca en su casa y en todas partes objetos viejos que pueda vender a través de un sitio en Internet.
Su padre, George Gibbs, es profesor de Ciencias en la Universidad. A George le preocupa que su hijo «pierda el tiempo» buscando cosas y hurgando aquí y allá sólo por un auto. Para él, Zack debería dedicarse más bien a estudiar, porque si no, ¿qué hará cuando sea mayor? Zack piensa que su padre no lo comprende. En realidad, no existe una buena comunicación entre ambos.
Un día Zack estaba en el sótano de su casa, buscando algo interesante para vender cuando, entre los trastos, encuentra un extraño reloj; apretó un botón y de pronto, el tiempo se detuvo. La gente, los animales y las cosas parecían congeladas. ¡Eso sí que era más interesante y genial que una lámina sobre cuatro ruedas! Zack había entrado al hipertiempo y podría hacer las cosas que quisiera como nunca antes.
Pero aquel poderoso reloj no estaba en casa de Zack por casualidad: era un proyecto de investigación de su padre, muy secreto.


=== Poder del hipertiempo ===
Para una persona en el hipertiempo, todo lo que sucede en el mundo normal se mueve tan lento que parece estático; es como si el tiempo se detuviera. Pero esa persona puede moverse como siempre; es decir, se mueve con normalidad en un mundo inmóvil. Para los habitantes del tiempo normal, los átomos y las moléculas de una persona que se encuentra en el hipermundo se mueven tan rápidamente que no se pueden detectar, por lo que una persona en el hipertiempo es invisible para ellos.

320,"Se denomina escuela cínica (del griego κύων kyon: ‘perro’, denominación atribuida debido a su frugal modo de vivir) a la fundada en la Antigua Grecia durante la segunda mitad del siglo IV a. C. El griego Antístenes fue su fundador y Diógenes de Sinope uno de sus filósofos más reconocidos y representativos de su época. Reinterpretaron la doctrina socrática considerando que la civilización y su forma de vida era un mal y que la felicidad venía dada siguiendo una vida simple y acorde con la naturaleza. El hombre llevaba en sí mismo ya los elementos para ser feliz y conquistar su autonomía era de hecho el verdadero bien. De ahí el desprecio a las riquezas y a cualquier forma de preocupación material. El hombre con menos necesidades era el más libre y el más feliz. Figuran en esta escuela, además de los ya citados, Crates de Tebas, discípulo de Diógenes, su esposa Hiparquía y Menipo de Gadara.[1]​
Los cínicos fueron famosos por sus excentricidades, de las cuales cuenta muchas Diógenes Laercio, y por la composición de numerosas sátiras o diatribas contra la corrupción de las costumbres y los vicios de la sociedad griega de su tiempo, practicando una actitud muchas veces irreverente, la llamada anaideia. Ciertos aspectos de la moral cínica influyeron en el estoicismo, pero, si bien la actitud de los cínicos es crítica respecto a los males de la sociedad, la de los estoicos es de acción mediante la virtud.


== Cinismo ==
El cinismo es un movimiento que se desarrolló en Grecia, durante los siglos IV y III a. C., y siguió en las grandes ciudades del Imperio Romano: Roma, Alejandría y Constantinopla hasta el siglo V. Uno de los orígenes del nombre está asociado a uno de sus fundadores, el primero fue Antístenes, que le puso este nombre por el lugar donde solía enseñar, que era un gimnasio llamado Cinosarges, lo que, traducido, vendría a ser perro blanco o perro veloz. Después, por el comportamiento de Antístenes y Diógenes, les apodaron kínicos, ya que sus comportamientos se asemejaban al de los perros, aunque al principio esta escuela fue llamada “escuela socrática menor”. La actitud cínica fue iniciada en Occidente por Diógenes de Sinope en el siglo IV a. C.
El cinismo no fue una escuela a pesar de este título. Una escuela filosófica era un establecimiento en el cual se impartía una doctrina o inspiración intelectual mantenida por un grupo de personas dirigidas por un superior. Antístenes fue uno de sus fundadores y las reuniones las realizaban en un gimnasio que frecuentaban. Ellos estaban en contra de la escuela, repudiaban las ciencias, las normas y las convenciones, en especial Antístenes.


=== Descripción de una persona cínica ===
Estos individuos aspiraban a identificarse con la figura del perro, por la sencillez y desfachatez de la vida canina. Usaban barba, llevaban alforja y cayado, practicaban juegos de palabras a manera de metodología: a aquellos que proponían ideas y teorías incomprensibles, ellos ponían el gesto, el humor y la ironía.
Los cínicos tomaron como modelo la naturaleza y los animales; invitaban al alboroto de toda sepultura.
Alcifrón retrata a un cínico de la siguiente manera:

Es un espectáculo horrible y penoso de ver, cuando agita su sucia melena y te mira insolentemente. Se presenta medio desnudo, con una capa raída, una bolsita colgante y, entre sus manos, una maza hecha de madera de peral silvestre. Va descalzo, no se lava y carece de oficio y beneficio. No quiere saber nada de su hacienda ni de nosotros, sus padres, sino que, por el contrario, nos reniega, pues afirma que todas las cosas son obra de la naturaleza y que la unión de elementos es la causa de la generación y no los progenitores. Evidentemente, desprecia el dinero y aborrece el cultivo de la tierra. No tiene sentido de la vergüenza y el pudor se ha borrado de su rostro.[2]​


== El cinismo moderno/antiguo ==
Con el tiempo, el concepto de cinismo fue mutando, y hoy se asocia a la tendencia a no creer en la sinceridad o bondad humana, ni en sus motivaciones ni en sus acciones, así como una tendencia a expresar esta actitud mediante la ironía, el sarcasmo y la burla.
Casi 2000 años después de que ciertos filósofos griegos hubieran abrazado el cinismo clásico, en el siglo XVII y XVIII escritores como Shakespeare, Swift, Voltaire y, siguiendo las tradiciones de Geoffrey Chaucer y François Rabelais, utilizan la ironía, el sarcasmo y la sátira para ridiculizar la conducta humana y reactivar el cinismo. En el aspecto literario, figuras del siglo XIX y XX como Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Dorothy Parker, HL Mencken, utilizaron el cinismo como forma de comunicar sus opiniones bajo algunas manifestaciones de la naturaleza humana. En 1930, Bertrand Russell en el ensayo sobre el cinismo juvenil pudo describir la medida en que (a su modo de ver) el cinismo había penetrado en las conciencias occidentales en masa, y puso acento especial en las áreas parcialmente influidas por el cinismo: la religión, la patria (el patriotismo), el progreso, la belleza, la verdad.


== Personajes importantes del cinismo ==


=== Antístenes ===
Fue uno de los filósofos más relevantes de su época, discípulo directo de Sócrates; tuvo a su vez una influencia decisiva en algunas de las escuelas que se formaron en este periodo, tanto por sus teorías como por su actitud y su forma de vida.
Antístenes nació en Atenas, entre los años 450 y 445 A.C., y murió en al año 366 A.C. Su padre fue un ciudadano ateniense y su madre una esclava tracia. Este mestizaje le impedía conseguir la ciudadanía ateniense, pero no parece que esto le importunara demasiado.
Su andadura filosófica comenzó como discípulo del famoso sofista Gorgias, que como todo sofista cobraba por enseñar, por lo cual se podría deducir que Antístenes gozaba de una buena posición económica. En este mismo tiempo se inició también en los misterios órficos. Sin embargo, su principal aprendizaje fue con Sócrates, de quien se hizo discípulo y amigo hasta la muerte de este.
Antístenes estuvo presente en la muerte de Sócrates, mientras discutían sobre la inmortalidad del alma y esperaban a que llegara el momento de beber el veneno que le causaría la muerte.
La tranquilidad del viejo maestro en tan decisivos momentos causó una profunda impresión en todos los que estaban allí presentes. Probablemente esto influyera en la insistencia posterior de Antístenes en la ataraxia.[3]​ Un buen día Antístenes decidió prescindir de todo lo superfluo y fundar su propia escuela. Lo hizo en un gimnasio en las afueras de Atenas llamado cinosarges, que quiere decir perro blanco. El cambio es tan radical que se manifiesta también externamente, viste ahora un manto, un zurrón y un bastón, indumentaria que se convierte en el uniforme del cínico. Prescinde de una manera decisiva de todo lo que no puede llevar encima, con la intención de librarse de los caprichos de la fortuna y regir su propio destino.
El objetivo es alcanzar la felicidad y las virtudes de un ser humano y esto se consigue si uno depende solo de sí mismo. Lo fundamental para el cínico es la autarquía, es decir la independencia de todo condicionamiento exterior, la autosuficiencia, que puede aprenderse pero que requiere un esfuerzo. Atrás queda todo aquello que considera que ya no le pertenece al sabio, la familia, el dinero, la fama y sobre todo sus antiguos pensamientos. En cierta ocasión afirmó que la mayor dicha era, sin duda, morir feliz.
Antístenes vivía según su propia ley, la que él mismo eligió para sí. Las leyes establecidas, las convenciones sociales no eran para este sabio, que como todos los cínicos despreciaba las normas, las instituciones, las costumbres y todo lo que representa una atadura para el hombre. Predicaba una vuelta a la naturaleza como revulsivo a la domesticación social y cultural que se imponía en las ciudades. Poseía una amplia cultura y escribió numerosos libros, de los cuales actualmente tan solo se conservan 2 breves fragmentos.


=== Crates de Tebas ===
Crates de Tebas era un ciudadano adinerado y de buena posición social, que renunció a toda su fortuna para hacerse filósofo cínico. Fue discípulo de Diógenes y maestro de Zenón de Citio. Crates, a diferencia de su maestro, era un hombre amable y tranquilo, que le valió el sobrenombre de ""el filántropo"", así como el de ""abrepuertas"" porque la gente le llamaba a sus casas para pedirle consejo y charlar con él. Nació en Tebas aproximadamente en el año 368 A.C., pero enseguida se marchó a Atenas para hacerse seguidor de Diógenes. Murió hacia el año 288 A.C. Como todos los cínicos predicaba la autarquía y la sencillez dando ejemplo con su vida y sus actos, y aunque de estilo menos agresivo que sus predecesores, su actitud es la misma que los demás.
Para Crates la filosofía le libera de su esclavitud externa, en cuanto a la familia, la propiedad o las costumbres sociales y le libera también de esclavitud interna, de sus opiniones, manteniendo su radical libertad individual. Para conseguir vivir feliz, es suficiente con lo mínimo, es esencial la frugalidad y la distancia con las instituciones y las leyes. Crates escribió bastantes obras de literatura en las que consiguió mantener un buen nivel. Eran parodias que escondían mensajes éticos. Pretendía propagar los principios de Diógenes, de una manera atractiva, y de esta manera consiguió llegar a una audiencia bastante amplia.


=== Diógenes de Sinope ===
Nació en Sinope (Asia Menor) entre los años 413 a. C. y 400 a. C. y murió en Corinto en el año 323 a. C. Fue desterrado de Sinope. Forzado por estas circunstancias deambuló por Esparta, Corinto y Atenas, y en esta ciudad frecuentó el cinosarges y se hizo discípulo de Antístenes, optó por llevar una vida austera y adoptó la indumentaria cínica, como su maestro. Desde sus comienzos en Atenas mostró un carácter apasionado. Pone en práctica de una manera radical las teorías de su maestro Antístenes. Lleva al extremo la libertad de palabra, su dedicación es criticar y denunciar todo aquello que limita al hombre, en particular las instituciones. Propone una nueva valoración frente a la valoración tradicional y se enfrenta constantemente a las normas sociales. Se considera cosmopolita, es decir, ciudadano del mundo, en cualquier parte se encuentra el cínico como en su casa y reconoce esto mismo en los demás, por tanto el mundo es de todos. La leyenda cuenta que se deshizo de todo lo que no era indispensable, incluso abandonó su escudilla cuando vio que un muchacho bebía agua en el hueco de las manos. Todo esto es posible pero se necesita un duro entrenamiento. Diógenes, como todos los cínicos recomienda el entrenamiento para adquirir la areté, ejercitarse tanto física como mentalmente para endurecerse y llegar a la impasibilidad y a la autosuficiencia. La independencia se consigue con el esfuerzo. Escribió algunos libros, que se han perdido. Eran de carácter breve y en forma de máximas o sentencias agudas e irónicas. Su muerte ha dado que hablar y actualmente no se sabe la verdadera causa. Según algunos murió por su propia voluntad, suicidándose mediante la ""contención del aliento"", dueño de su destino y del momento de su muerte, aunque esto sería algo metafórico, pues es imposible morir por dejar de respirar voluntariamente. Según otros murió de las mordeduras de un perro o de una indigestión por comer pulpo crudo.


=== Metrocles e Hiparquía ===
Metrocles hermano de Hiparquía y proveniente de una familia rica, nació en Marinea (Tracia). Desde muy pequeño empezó a tener inquietudes filosóficas, y gracias a que tenía mucho dinero se pudo dedicar a ello.
Era un niño tímido y para reforzar su carácter sus padres decidieron confiarlo al maestro Crates que con fama de duro aconsejó a Metrocles fortificar su cuerpo. Estando un día en uno de sus entrenamientos se le escapó una ventosidad involuntariamente, el hecho le pareció tan sumamente humillante que este se encerró en su habitación con la intención de dejarse morir de hambre. Crates entró en el habitáculo e intentó convencer con palabras de que no había hecho nada absurdo sino que lo sería para la naturaleza, no expulsar los flatos; luego este empezó a soltar flatos para alentarlo con razones, y así fue, tantas ventosidades escuchó el alumno que acabó acostumbrándose a ello y rechazó la idea de quitarse la vida. Desde entonces Metrocles fue discípulo de Crates y fue un célebre filósofo.
Murió a edad tardía estrangulándose con las manos.
Su hermana Hiparquía fue una de las primeras mujeres filósofas, la única cínica. Cuando tenía quince años sintió un profundo interés por la Escuela Cínica y decidió seguir los pasos de Crates. Convivió con él y finalmente se casó con éste a pesar de la oposición de su familia. Tanto deseaba casarse con Crates que amenazó con suicidarse si no lo hacía. Hiparquía deseaba convertirse en cínica ya que el modo de vida de una persona cínica era algo inusual.
Con él compartió una forma muy peculiar de vida cínica. Ambos decidieron llevar este estilo de vida. Tuvieron al menos un hijo educado bajo los valores cínicos. Durante el embarazo no abandonó sus ejercicios y cuando nació su hijo Pasicles lo lavaba en la concha de una tortuga y además con agua fría.
Hiparquía siempre acudía a todas y cada una de las reuniones a las que acudía su marido. Esta era rechazada radicalmente por la sociedad de la antigua Grecia ya que en esta época las mujeres debían ocuparse sola y exclusivamente de las labores domésticas y de tejeduría.


=== Menedemo ===
Filósofo de la secta de Fedón y discípulo de Caloto Lampsaceno. Provenía de una familia noble. Se dice que era un gran supersticioso. Su vestimenta constaba de una túnica oscura, en la cabeza un casco arcádico que tenía dibujado doce signos, con calzado trágico, barba bastante larga y un bastón de fresno en la mano. Los eretrienses lo enviaron a Megara, a la escuela de Platón, donde dejó la milicia; allí conoció a Estilpón y ambos navegaron a Élide y conocieron a Mosco y a Anquipilo, ambos discípulos de Fedón. Menedemo fue un hombre muy serio por razón de Crates, que lo llamaba toro Eretrio y el esculapio Fliasio. Y Timón dice que era muy vocinglero y fútil en cuanto hablaba. Dicen que era un hombre sencillo y muy descuidado; además no guardaba ningún orden para la gente que le oía porque no había asientos a su alrededor, sino que cada uno se sentaba donde quería.
Apreciaba bastante a Arato y a Licofrón, poeta trágico; también a Antágoras Rodio; pero más que a todos veneraba a Homero, después a los líricos. Los discursos de Menedemo eran muy difíciles de comprender. Era de ingenio cambiante e inventor de nuevas frases. Se dice que no escribió ni compuso nada. Al principio este fue muy despreciado por la sociedad y los eretrienses lo llamaban perro, más tarde rectificaron y lo admitieron en el gobierno de la república. Fue embajador de Lisímaco y embajador de las cortes de Tolomeo.
Finalmente según Heráclides murió a los setenta y cuatro años de edad.


=== Menipo ===
De origen fenicio fue filósofo y poeta en la escuela cínica. Se cree que fue el propulsor de la sátira menipea escrita en verso y prosa. Se conocen muy poca información sobre su vida en general. Fue esclavo liberto. Algunos filósofos afirman que los libros donde se encuentra su nombre no son suyos, sino de Dionisio y de Zopiro que se los entregaron a Menipo para que los pusiese en orden. Los libros cínicos son trece: Funerarias, Testamentos, Cartas elegantes, En persona de los dioses, A los físicos, Matemáticos y gramáticos, La generación de Epicuro, La supersticiosa celebración epicúrea del día vigésimo del mes y otras obras.


=== Onesícrito de Astipalea ===
La vida de Onesícrito de Astipalea transcurrió entre el año – 380 a -300. Acompañó a Alejandro Magno en una de sus investigaciones en la India. Este intelectual está relacionado con la “escuela cínica”. Se conservan pocos testimonios que hablen sobre él. Fue discípulo de Diógenes, aunque este cínico no es muy conocido; empezó a ser más popular a partir de la llegada del ejército macedonio a la India en su viaje con Alejandro Magno.
Onesícrito al igual que ocurrió con otros autores, escribió sobre la India en muchas de sus obras.
A lo largo de su vida viajo por muchos países. Se dice de él que no se consideraba un auténtico cínico, no fue como sus predecesores, pero su actitud y la propagación del cinismo hizo que Diógenes Laercio le incluyera en su libro; el nombre de Onesícrito figura en cualquier lista de filósofos cínicos.

321,"Las relaciones España-Bangladés son las relaciones bilaterales entre estos dos países. Bangladés tiene una embajada en Madrid[1]​ y dos consulados: en Barcelona y Zaragoza.[2]​ España tiene una embajada en Daca.[3]​


== Relaciones diplomáticas ==
La Embajada de España en Daca se abrió en 2008, lo que ha propiciado una mayor presencia de España y lo español en Bangladés. Las relaciones diplomáticas entre los dos países son buenas, sin contenciosos importantes. Aunque tradicionalmente la presencia de España ha sido muy reducida en el país asiático, las relaciones bilaterales van intensificándose progresivamente, fomentando un mayor conocimiento mutuo.[4]​
Una de las cuestiones bilaterales de mayor contenido son las concernientes al ámbito migratorio. Ambos países cooperan en buena sintonía para prevenir y luchar contra la migración irregular. Desde el punto de vista cultural, destaca la presencia en Daca de una Cátedra de Lengua y Cultura Española en el Instituto de Lenguas Modernas de la Universidad de Daca, financiada por la empresa española Inditex, que cuenta en la actualidad con cinco profesores de español y unos 400 alumnos locales. Con el apoyo de la Embajada de España, en 2014 la Cátedra Inditex ha puesto en marcha un programa para la impartición de español a diplomáticos bangladesíes.[4]​


== Relaciones económicas ==
La balanza comercial bilateral arroja un importante déficit en contra de España, con una muy baja tasa de cobertura. España importó de Bangladés por valor de 1.507 millones de euros en 2014 y exportó por valor de 107.[5]​
Las importaciones españolas se concentran prácticamente todas en el sector de la confección textil (un 95%). Muchas de estas importaciones son efectuadas por empresas españolas que compran en Bangladés. Los fabricantes suelen ser bangladesíes, a menudo muy dependientes en diseño, estándares económicos y sociales y distribución a estas grandes empresas, si bien formalmente no suele existir vinculación jurídica. También hay otras, de tipo medio, que surten luego a minoristas de pequeña y mediana dimensión en España. Finalmente, hay algún fabricante que ha establecido su empresa directamente en Bangladés y exportan en buena medida su ropa a España.[5]​
Las exportaciones se concentran en sectores en buena medida también vinculados al textil: maquinaria, tanino y materias colorantes, productos químicos orgánicos y otros productos químicos y productos plásticos son las principales partidas.[5]​


== Cooperación ==
En el Plan Director 2009-2012 de la Cooperación Española, Bangladés se incluyó en la segunda categoría de países prioritarios, como País de Asociación Focalizada, es decir, dentro de aquel grupo de países en los que no existen oportunidades para establecer un marco de asociación a largo plazo, y en los que las actuaciones de cooperación se centran en un único sector clave o en más de uno pero bajo un único enfoque, con el objetivo de aumentar el impacto de las mismas.[6]​
Teniendo por tanto en cuenta dicho mandato, la concentración sectorial en Bangladesh se produjo en el sector de género. En estos momentos la mayor parte de las intervenciones de cooperación española han terminado o están a punto de terminar. Debido al proceso de concentración geográfica de la Cooperación Española, no se aprobarán probablemente más proyectos para Bangladés en un futuro próximo.[6]​

322,"CADUCEUS fue un sistema experto médico programado para realizar diagnósticos en medicina interna.[1]​ Su nombre deriva de Caduceo, un vocablo de origen griego (κηρύκειο) relacionado con la mitología. Fue terminado a mediados de la década de 1980, si bien el inicio de su desarrollo se remonta a la década de 1970, siendo programado por Harry Pople, de la Universidad de Pittsburgh, partiendo para el sistema de las entrevistas de Pople al Dr. Jack Meyers.
Pretendía mejorar el MYCIN, sistema que a su vez se basaba en DENDRAL y que estaba focalizado sobre las bacterias infecciosas de la sangre. CADUCEUS, eventualmente, podía diagnosticar hasta 1.000 enfermedades diferentes, usando un motor de inferencia semejante al del MYCIN, usando un grafo acíclico direccionado que representaba las relaciones de causalidad entre variables.[2]​
El CADUCEUS ha sido descrito como el sistema experto ""de mayor conocimiento intensivo existente"".[3]​

325,"La Provincia eclesiástica de Sevilla es una demarcación territorial eclesiástica que constituye una de las 14 provincias eclesiásticas de España. Está constituida por la archidiócesis de Sevilla y sus dos diócesis sufragáneas: Cádiz y Ceuta, Córdoba, Huelva, Canarias, Asidonia-Jerez y Tenerife.


== Historia ==
Durante la época romana, Sevilla fue la capital de la provincia de la Bética, y el origen de la diócesis se remonta a la Sede Apostólica, o por lo menos al siglo I. San Geroncio, obispo de Itálica, predicó en la Bética durante los tiempos apostólicos, y que sin lugar a dudas han dejado a un pastor de su propia Sevilla. Es cierto que en el año 303, cuando las Santas Justa y Rufina fueron martirizadas por negarse a adorar al ídolo de Salambó, hubo un obispo de Sevilla llamado Sabino, que asistió al Consejo de Illiberis en el año 287.[1]​
Zenón (472-486) fue nombrado vicario apostólico por el papa Simplicio, y el papa Hormisdas dio el mismo cargo al obispo Salustio en las provincias de Bética y Lusitania. Sin embargo, la sede se hizo ilustre sobre todo por los santos hermanos santos Leandro e Isidoro. El primero de ellos contribuyó a la conversión de San Hermenegildo y Recaredo , y presidió el III Concilio de Toledo en el 589. Mientras que el último presidió el IV Concilio de Toledo y fue el maestro de la España medieval.
En el siglo XIII la diócesis de Córdoba pasa a depender de la archidiócesis de Sevilla. El 7 de julio de 1406 se erigió la diócesis de San Marcial del Rubicón. En 1483 la sede episcopal se trasladó a la isla de Gran Canaria, donde permanece desde entonces la diócesis de Canarias. El 1 de febrero de 1819 se desprende de su jurisdicción la actual provincia de Santa Cruz de Tenerife para constituir la diócesis de San Cristóbal de La Laguna.
Con el descubrimiento de América, las primeras diócesis americanas fueron sufragáneas de esta archidiócesis, teniendo Sevilla jurisdicción sobre estas hasta la elevación a archidiócesis de las Santo Domingo, México y Lima en 1546.[2]​
La diócesis de Huelva se formó en 1953 por una bula del papa Pío XII a partir de la superficie de la actual provincia de Huelva.
La diócesis de Asidonia-Jerez también se erigió de igual forma que la de Huelva en 1980 cogiendo la parte de la provincia de Cádiz que pertenecía a esta archidiócesis. En la Hispania visigoda fue capital de provincia y también sede episcopal de la iglesia católica, entonces conocida como Asidona.


== Organización territorial ==


=== Datos de la provincia eclesiástica ===
El arzobispo de Sevilla es el metropolitano de la provincia y tiene autoridad limitada sobre las diócesis sufragáneas.[3]​
Actualmente, la provincia tiene alrededor de 1.475 parroquias, abarca unos 53.030 km² en donde habitan aproximadamente 6.699.853 de personas de las cuales el 92,71% son católicos.

328,"Catharine Trotter Cockburn (16 de agosto de 1679 - 11 de mayo de 1749) fue una novelista, dramaturga y filósofa inglesa.


== Biografía ==
Nació de padres escoceses que vivían en Londres. Se crió como protestante pero se convirtió al catolicismo siendo muy joven. Su padre murió en 1684, dejando a la familia en una posición económica delicada.
Su primera novela, The Adventures of a Young Lady, más tarde rebautizada con el título de Olinda’s Adventures se publicó anónimamente en 1693, cuando ella tenía catorce años. Su primera obra dramática, Agnes de Castro (Inés de Castro) (una dramatización en verso de la historia del mismo título escrita por Aphra Behn se representó dos años después. En 1696, se vio satirizada junto a Delarivier Manley y Mary Pix en la obra anónima, The Female Wits (Los ingenios femeninos). Su segunda obra, considerada la mejor, es The Fatal Friendship representada en 1698. Las obras dramáticas de Trotter encontraron un modesto éxito de público y alabanzas por parte de la crítica.
En 1702, Trotter publicó su primera obra filosófica, A Defence of Mr. Lock's [sic.] Essay of Human Understanding. John Locke regaló dinero y libros a su joven apologista.
Regresó al seno de la Iglesia de Inglaterra en 1707. Al año siguiente, se casó con el reverendo Patrick Cockburn, y dejó de escribir hasta 1726. La familia sufrió al no prestar el Juramento de Abjuración con motivo del ascenso de Jorge I. El reverendo finalmente se sobrepuso a sus escrúpulos en 1726, y le nombraron para la Capilla de san Pablo en Aberdeen.

333,"La Iglesia de San Antonio de Padua es un templo colombiano de culto católico, bajo la advocación de San Antonio de Padua, está localizado en el Parque Principal de Yalí (Antioquia), y pertenece a la jurisdicción eclesiástica de la Diócesis de Santa Rosa de Osos. El edificio es de planta rectangular, su interior está dividido en tres naves, y su fachada principal de diseño moderno, cuenta con dos torres.


== Historia ==
En 1938, el Presbítero Joaquín Pablo Londoño había planeado un ensanche de la pequeña iglesia existente y alcanzó a iniciar algunos trabajos, cuando sucedió su retiro de la parroquia.
El Padre Jesús María Quijano queda al frente de la parroquia, y una de sus primeras intenciones fue construir un nuevo templo, conforme con las necesidades y crecimiento de la población, por lo cual puso todo su empeño, además contó con el apoyo y entusiasmo de los habitantes. En julio de 1942 se colocó y bendijo la primera piedra. En 1944, con la respectiva licencia de Obispo de la Diócesis de Santa Rosa de Osos, se estableció la “Junta de Fábrica” y se elaboró el presupuesto de gastos e inversiones. Para enero de 1945, se emprendieron los trabajos alrededor de la capilla, bajo la dirección de Juan Alzate, que veces hacía las tareas de director de la obra, constructor e interventor, con especial cuidado y habilidad, sin ser ingeniero ni arquitecto.
El Padre Quijano, enfocó toda su actividad, como sabía hacerlo, en la búsqueda y obtención de los recursos económicos y de los materiales para la obra. Obtuvo piedra en la vereda de Tacamocho y planeó los “convites de piedra”, en los que la población participaba acarreando el material al hombro y a lomo de mula, desde la cantera hasta el lugar de la edificación. Roberto Roldán, en su tejar igualmente de Tacamocho, produjo los ladrillos y cuñas ornamentales requeridos para la obra del tempo.
Juan Alzate se retira de la construcción, entró a reemplazarlo en la dirección de la obra, Joaquín Duque (el sordo Duque). Por problemas y dificultades de diversa naturaleza, fue necesario suspender la obra por cortos períodos, pero la estructura avanzaba, se le colocó techado al presbiterio, en 1950 con la nave occidental construida, se trasladó el santísimo sacramento, se puso en servicio el templo y se dio paso a la demolición de la antigua iglesia que sirvió durante 40 años. La obra continuaba, se terminó la cubierta, los muros, las columnas, los artísticos vitrales y las sacristías. La construcción del techo, con maderas finas, estuvo a cargo del carpintero Antonio Barrera.
Cuando llegó el día del retiro del Padre Quijano de la Parroquia, el templo se encontraba en obra negra, pero en funcionamiento. Los sucesivos párrocos continuaron la labor de acabados y decoración. El Presbítero Guillermo Yepes, construyó los altares y el atrio; este último tocó después que modificarlo. El padre Rafael Zuluaga sé propuso levantar las torres de la iglesia, contó con el diseño del arquitecto Gustavo Moreno Llano y con Joaquín Duque y Abraham García, como maestros de obra, quienes levantaron en ladrillo dichas estructuras, con vanos en forma de cruz. Pero por desgracia, según revelación del mismo arquitecto, no se realizó cálculo de resistencias, porque el párroco no lo juzgó necesario.
Posteriormente llegó como nuevo párroco el Presbítero Hildebrando Botero, que halló la obra negra del templo terminada y siguió dándole acabados. Se encargó de los cielos rasos, labor que realizó Francisco Villada. Revocó todas las paredes del templo, pavimentó el presbiterio, las sacristías y el piso de la iglesia, con granito.
Otra de las metas del Presbítero Hildebrando Botero fue la de obtener el reloj para las torres, y que fuera útil a los habitantes del pueblo. Pensó adquirir uno de marca española, pero se decidió por el Taller de Mecánica Industrial San Rafael para que fabricara un reloj fino, de buena calidad y con cuatro caras, que diera horas y medias-horas utilizando las campanas sonoras que había traído el Padre Londoño. Las caras de forma circular de metro y medio de diámetro. En una torre se colocaron tres caras y la cuarta en la otra torre, que funcionaba con un mecanismo especial conectado a la torre del reloj. Este tuvo un costo de $25.000.00 y con los gastos de instalación el valor ascendió a $30.000.00.
Funcionó bien, sin contratiempos a partir de mayo de 1967 hasta el 29 de julio del mismo año, cuando un sismo derrumbó una de las torres y la otra quedó seriamente afectada, por lo cual se desarmó el reloj y se demolió dicha torre. Esta desventura llenó de amargura al Padre Botero. Pasado un tiempo, a otro párroco le tocó reconstruir las torres, se volvió a instalar con sus cuatro caras en una sola torre, y hoy en día sigue funcionando correctamente.

334,"Shihan (師範, ''Shihan''?) es un término del idioma japonés, generalmente usado en las artes marciales procedentes de Japón como un título honorífico para referirse a los maestros de maestros en un estilo específico.
Las diferentes organizaciones de artes marciales tienen diversos requerimientos para el uso del término en carácter de título honorífico, generalmente involucra ciertos derechos como el de usar símbolos especiales que identifican el rango y otorgar grados en el arte en el cual se ostenta.
Por ejemplo en la organización del arte del ninjutsu, la Bujinkan se genera el derecho cuando los otros shihan se refieren a la persona con ese título (debe tener como mínimo 10 dan ya que esta organización son 15 el máximo), en judo, en karate y en aikidō se llega al título de shihan al alcanzar al menos el grado de sexto dan.
En el daitō-ryū el título de shihan no está vinculado al grado de dan aunque con frecuencia implica un mínimo de 5º dan sino que requiere además el certificado de Kyōju Dairi expedido por otro shihan o por quién posea el certificado menkyo kayden o el sōke del arte.
En otras organizaciones. como por ejemplo el aikidō estilo shōdōkan el título es más organizacional y menos vinculado al grado. Los títulos vinculados generalmente previos son el de renshi y kyoshi también referidos a instructores autorizados del arte pero de menor grado de maestría.
En el reiki, sistema de sanación japonés, se les concede el título de shihan a aquellos practicantes que han alcanzado el cuarto nivel o maestría.",es,Shihan,https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shihan

336,"El marketing de compradores tiene lugar en la tienda y su objetivo es convertir en compradores a los consumidores que visitan la tienda. En otras palabras, el objetivo del marketing de compradores es generar decisiones de compra en la tienda, junto al producto. El consumidor del producto y su comprador pueden ser personas diferentes. Por ejemplo, la madre de la familia puede ser responsable el 90% de las compras de productos de consumo de toda la familia, mientras que el consumo puede estar repartido por igual entre cuatro miembros de la familia.
Desde el punto de vista del minorista, el marketing de compradores significa que los proveedores centran sus inversiones de marketing en el punto de venta en lugar de en medios tradicionales. Otro factor de fondo significativo en el auge del marketing de compradores es una mejor comprensión de los consumidores y su comportamiento de compra, algo posible gracias a sistemas informáticos más avanzados (por ejemplo, datos de compra basados en tarjetas de fidelización de clientes). La inversión de los proveedores en el marketing en tienda crecen anualmente un 21% .[1]​Por ejemplo, según los informes financieros de la compañía, Procter & Gamble invierte al menos 500 millones de dólares al año .[2]​en marketing de compradores. Los siguientes resultados de distintas investigaciones, entre otras, han redireccionado las inversiones de marketing de consumidores hacia el marketing de compradores:
El 70% de las elecciones de marca se hacen en el punto de venta[1]​
El 68% de las decisiones de compra no están premeditadas[3]​
El 5% son fieles a una sola marca dentro de una categoría específica[4]​


== Categorías ==
El marketing de compradores siempre tiene su punto de partida en el comprador, es decir, la persona encargada de hacer la compra. Por tanto, el marketing de compradores se refiere a los estímulos de marketing que llegan hasta el comprador en la propia tienda y que se basan en la comprensión del comportamiento de compra del comprador. Al igual que en el mix de marketing tradicional, el marketing de compradores puede dividirse en cuatro Ps: producto; precio; posicionamiento y promoción.
Producto: tamaño, forma, color, material, packaging, mensajes en el packaging e identidad visual.
Precio: descuentos, ofertas de pack, comunicación de precios y cupones.
Posicionamiento: concepto de tienda, iluminación, pasillos, estantes, colocación de expositores para la tienda y colocación de los artículos en los lineales Planograma.
Promoción: promociones de packaging, promociones específicas de la tienda, comunicaciones promocionales, expositores para la tienda, TV en tienda, adhesivos de suelo y publicidad en carritos y cestas.


== Datos de comportamiento de compra ==
Tres métodos distintos de recolección de datos proporcionan información acerca del comportamiento de compra de los compradores: observación, entrevista y sistema de cajas registradoras.
Las observaciones hechas en la tienda aclaran cómo se comporta el comprador a la hora de comprar un producto. Algunos aspectos a observar son, por ejemplo: la duración del proceso de compra, los artículos que el comprador ha observado, tocado y estudiado, los artículos comprados finalmente y los hábitos de compra que influyen en todo el proceso.
Las entrevistas ayudan a determinar los motivos que guían el comportamiento de compra. Los aspectos aclarados habitualmente son: facilidad para sustituir el producto e identificación de sustitutos; valores y actitudes; deseos y factores de motivación; y estilo de vida y situación personal.
El sistema de cajas registradoras proporciona información acerca de cuándo y qué productos se compraron. Además, las tarjetas de cliente habitual hacen posible interconectar recetas sobre las compras hechas por compradores concretos, lo cual genera datos absolutos acerca de los artículos comprados por un comprador concreto en un momento determinado. La máxima comprensión del comportamiento de compra de un comprador se obtiene al combinar la información obtenida por los métodos ya mencionados de recolección de datos, dando lugar a un conocimiento profundo de los compradores (cómo, por qué, qué y cuándo).


== Segmentación de compradores ==
A la hora de segmentar compradores, se divide el mercado en grupos esenciales y medibles, es decir, segmentos basados en datos de comportamiento de compra. La segmentación de compradores hace más fácil responder a los requisitos de los distintos segmentos. Por ejemplo, los compradores sensibles al precio y los tradicionales se diferencian claramente unos de otros en cuanto a su comportamiento de compra. La segmentación hace posible enfocar las operaciones de marketing a los compradores más rentables.


== Ejemplos de segmentación de compradores ==

341,"La coordinación muscular o motora es la capacidad que tienen los músculos esqueléticos del cuerpo de sincronizarse bajo parámetros de trayectoria y movimiento.[1]​ La coordinación es una capacidad física complementaria que permite al deportista realizar movimientos ordenados y dirigidos a la obtención de un gesto técnico. Es decir, la coordinación complementa a las capacidades físicas básicas para hacer de los movimientos gestos deportivos. Podemos hacer cualquier tipo de movimientos: rápidos -velocidad-, durante mucho tiempo -resistencia- y para desplazar objetos pesados -fuerza-.
El resultado de la coordinación motora es una acción intencional, sincrónica y sinérgica. Tales movimientos ocurren de manera eficiente por contracción coordinada de la musculatura necesaria así como el resto de los componentes de las extremidades involucradas. La coordinación muscular está mínimamente asociada con procesos de integración del sistema nervioso, el esqueleto y el control del cerebro y la médula espinal.
El cerebelo regula la información sensitiva que llega del cuerpo, coordinándola con estímulos procedentes del cerebro, lo que permite realizar movimientos finos y precisos. Junto a esta coordinación de movimientos, el cerebelo regula y controla el tono muscular.[2]​


== Aprendizaje ==
El grupo muscular que se requiere para un movimiento, ha de tener una determinada velocidad e intensidad correctos para dicha acción. Para ello, se necesita previamente un aprendizaje y una automatización, que serán regulados a nivel cerebeloso y vestibular con ayuda de la percepción visual.[1]​ Podemos observar varios tipos de coordinación como la dinámica general (por ejemplo andar a 4 patas), la oculomanual (lanzar un objeto) o la bimanual (escribir a máquina o tocar un instrumento).


== Patologías ==
Alrededor del 8% de los niños en edad escolar tienen algún grado de trastorno del desarrollo de la coordinación motriz, pudiendo estos tropezar con sus propios pies, chocar contra otros niños, tener problemas para sostener objetos y tener una forma de caminar inestable.[3]​
Existe una alteración de la coordinación llamada ataxia que suele acompañarse de alteraciones del equilibrio y de la marcha, en la cuál se ven afectadas solamente aquellas regiones dedicadas concretamente a funciones del equilibrio. Estas alteraciones pueden crear movimientos desordenados, imprecisos, imposibilitando los movimientos rápidos que requieren alternancia como el tocar una guitarra.
Las personas con enfermedad mental tienen desafíos en el ámbito físico, principalmente en el estado de agitación y las dificultades de coordinación motriz.[4]​
En el proceso de envejecimiento se producen importantes cambios deficitarios, tales como la disminución de la memoria, el entorpecimiento senso-perceptivo, la merma en fuerza y coordinación motriz, etc. Estos serán más o menos acusados dependiendo de los hábitos físicos.[5]​


== Estudio de coordinación muscular ==
En la profesión sanitaria, puede valorarse la coordinación muscular a través de ciertas técnicas de exploración como la prueba de índice-nariz que consiste en desplazar el índice hacia la nariz empezando con los ojos abiertos y después cerrándolos.[6]​ La coordinación muscular se puede entrenar, consiste en la mejora de la técnica de uno o varios movimientos, valiendo como entrenamiento efectivo la repetición del acto motor, el cuál el sistema nerviosos irá economizándolo, haciéndolo más preciso y usando menos fuerza cada momento, a la vez que automatiza el movimiento para que al realizarlo no tengamos que concentrarnos tanto como lo haríamos en un principio. Un estudio en mujeres mayores de 50 años, experimentaron mejoría en su resistencia cardiovascular y estuvieron próximas a mejorar significativamente su resistencia muscular, pero otros componentes, flexibilidad, coordinación y agilidad no presentaron mejoría o cambio significativo después de un programa de actividad física.[7]​
Este entrenamiento de la coordinación, tiene mayor utilidad en temas relacionados con la salud, como rehabilitación y tratamiento de una multitud de patologías asociadas al sistema músculo-esquelético y sistema neuromuscular, aquí es importante el rol del médico rehabilitador, el fisioterapeuta y el terapeuta ocupacional. --CORDINACIÓN NEUROMUSCULAR--
La Coordinación Neuromuscular se expresa permanentemente en situaciones cotidianas en nuestra vida. El sistema nervioso y el sistema endocrino controlan el funcionamiento de nuestro cuerpo, y esta en nosotros que ello se plasme de una manera agresiva, burda o plástica y elegante.


== Diferencia de géneros ==
Por lo general, las mujeres se comportan con más éxito en tareas manuales de precisión, que requieren una coordinación motriz aguda. Los hombres muestran mayor precisión que las mujeres en habilidades motoras dirigidas a un blanco, como lanzar o interceptar proyectiles.[8]​

Estudió en centros de Pasadena (California), y se graduó en la John Muir High School,[1] también de de Pasadena. Su primera aspiración era dedicarse a las bellas artes y la ilustración. Sin embargo, fue descubierta por Ida Koverman, secretaria del magnate Louis B. Mayer, uno de los fundadores de la MGM, tras verla en un póster representando al Padre Tiempo.
Tuvo una exitosa carrera en la MGM, la RKO y la Columbia con papeles importantes como el de Beth en la original Little Women (Mujercitas- España; Las cuatro hermanitas - Iberoamérica). Entre otras muchas interpretaciones cabe destacar Lady for A Day (Dama por un día), de Frank Capra; Gabriel Over the White House (El despertar de una nación); Sequoia; The Ghost Goes West (El fantasma va al Oeste), junto a Robert Donat; y Rasputin and the Empress, en la cual tuvo como compañeros a los hermanos Barrymore (John, Ethel, y Lionel), en la única película que rodaron juntos. En 1939, trabajó junto a Stan Laurel y Oliver Hardy en la producción de la RKO The Flying Deuces (Los locos del aire).
Parker permaneció activa en el cine durante los años cuarenta. Trabajó en Detective Kitty O' Day, con Lon Chaney en Los ojos del muerto (Dead Man's Eyes, 1944), de Reginald Le Borg (1902 – 1989), y en otras películas.
Parker administró su propio aeropuerto, junto a su entonces marido Doug Dawson, en Palm Springs, California, hasta poco después del inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Durante la guerra, visitó numerosos hospitales de veteranos en los Estados Unidos y trabajó en la radio. En los años cincuenta, Parker co-protagonizó junto a Edward G. Robinson ""Black Tuesday (Martes negro)"", tuvo un papel pequeño pero importante en ""Gunfighter (El pistolero)"", junto a Gregory Peck, y apareció junto a Randolph Scott y Angela Lansbury en el western ""Lawless Street (La ciudad sin ley)"" en 1955. Su última interpretación fue en 1966, en la película ""Apache Uprising"", dirigida por R.G. Springsteen.
Parker también trabajó en el teatro. En 1949 reemplazó a Judy Holliday en Born Yesterday, en Broadway, la cual fue un gran éxito. Parker también trabajó en Broadway junto a Bert Lahr en la obra Burlesque, hizo representaciones veraniegas en Bucks County, Pennsylvania, hizo una gira con la obra Candlelight and Loco, y formó parte de otras muchas producciones.
Estuvo casada con George MacDonald (1936-1940), con el ayudante de dirección Douglas Dawson (1941-1943), con Curtis Grotter (1944-1949) y con el actor Robert Lowery (1951-1957). Este último trabajaba en 1949 en la serie ""Batman and Robin"". En 1952 tuvieron un hijo, Robert Lowery Hanks, que fue ejecutivo en Los Ángeles, California. Más adelante, pasó una exitosa temporada en el circuito teatral de la Costa Oeste, y trabajó como profesora de interpretación.
Pasó sus últimos años en el Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital de Woodland Hills, California, donde falleció de un accidente cerebrovascular el 30 de noviembre de 2005, recién cumplidos los 90 años.

348,"Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen (Breslau, Imperio alemán, 2 de mayo de 1892 - † Vaux-sur-Somme, Francia, 21 de abril de 1918) fue un militar y aviador alemán; más conocido como el «Barón Rojo» (Der rote Baron), fue un piloto que consiguió derribar ochenta[1]​ aeroplanos enemigos durante la Primera Guerra Mundial antes de ser abatido en la mañana del 21 de abril de 1918 cerca del río Somme, en el norte de Francia.[2]​
Héroe de los alemanes, respetado por sus enemigos durante la Primera Guerra Mundial, permitía escapar a sus víctimas malheridas. Su unidad fue responsable del derribo de 151 aviones británicos, contra 66 de las propias, durante el mes de abril de 1917.[3]​ Por ello recibió la medalla Pour le Mérite.
Sus aviones, el caza biplano Albatros D.II y luego el triplano Fokker Dr.I, le permitían una amplia capacidad de maniobras y piruetas. Sin embargo, la mayoría de sus victorias en combates aéreos las consiguió en un avión tipo Albatros.


== Biografía ==


=== Infancia y juventud ===
Nació el 2 de mayo de 1892 en la capital de Silesia, Breslavia (hoy Wroclaw, perteneciente a Polonia). De niño se trasladó con su familia a Schweidnitz (hoy Swidnica, Polonia). Era el mayor de tres hermanos. Miembro de la familia aristocrática terrateniente Richthofen, el padre de Manfred había llegado a ocupar un alto cargo en el regimiento de Ulanos Nº 12, una unidad perteneciente a la poderosa caballería prusiana. Manfred y su hermano pequeño Lothar quisieron seguir los pasos de su padre, alistándose jóvenes en el ejército imperial. Practicó caza y equitación y cuando completó su adiestramiento como cadete, se alistó en los Ulanos (caballería alemana), siendo nombrado tres años después teniente del primer regimiento.


=== Primera Guerra Mundial ===

Durante la Primera Guerra Mundial, von Richthofen pasó de la caballería (donde ganó la condecoración de la Cruz de Hierro) a la infantería, pero en esta modalidad no prosperó, ya que las condiciones que se vivían en las trincheras eran inhumanas y ""muy aburridas"", según sus palabras. Finalmente encontró su lugar alistándose en la aviación, donde demostró una gran capacidad con esta arma, completamente innovadora para lo que hasta entonces había sido la guerra (la producción de aviones se incrementó desde los 300, que tenían todos los contrincantes al principio de la contienda, hasta los 150.000 al finalizar).

No logró destacar en la academia de aviadores, aunque luego demostró ser muy capaz en combate. En el principio sólo se dedicó a observar y fotografiar el frente oriental, pero lo que él quería eran aventuras.
En la Luftstreitkräfte, su encuentro con otro gran aviador, Oswald Boelcke, fue decisivo para su éxito. Boelcke lo seleccionó para el escuadrón de caza Jagdsstaffel o Jasta 2. Ya su primer combate fue una victoria. Sucedió sobre el cielo de Cambrai, Francia, el 17 de septiembre de 1916. Durante estos primeros meses se destacó por su agudeza visual y su innato don para afrontar el peligro. Sus compañeros decían que su personalidad se transformaba cuando asumía los mandos de su avión.
Durante los 20 meses siguientes, destacaría como el mejor as de la aviación alemana durante la Primera Guerra Mundial. Llegaría a superar el número de victorias de Boelcke: 40, un récord hasta entonces. En su victoria 11 consiguió derribar el biplano del as británico Lanoe Hawker. En enero de 1917 recibió la Cruz Pour le Mérite.


==== Circo volador Jasta 11 ====

En 1917 se le confirió el comando del Jasta 11, que luego fue conocido como el ""Circo volador"" por los vivaces colores que presentaban sus 14 aviones, los cuales, al igual que un circo, se trasladaban por ferrocarril al lugar adonde se los requería. Se ganó el apodo de Barón Rojo porque su avión estaba pintado de rojo para que sus rivales lo reconocieran; hábil maniobra psicológica, pues sus enemigos le temían mucho y admiraban su gran destreza guerrera. Llegó a dirigir 58 misiones con total éxito, en las cuales derribó a unos 80 aviones, algo que nadie llegó a superar en ningún bando durante el resto de la guerra. En abril sumó él solo 20 derribos. Sus hombres insinuaban que su líder tenía un comportamiento suicida. Pocos meses después recibió el encargo de dirigir la primera ala de caza de la historia aérea, la JG 1, integrada por los Jasta 4, 6, 10 y 11. Esta unidad llegó a derribar 644 aviones con sólo 56 bajas. Su hermano Lothar, alcanzó 40 victorias al final de la guerra en esta unidad, Kurt Wolff, 33 victorias y Karl Allmenroder 30 derribos. Todos lograron la Cruz Pour le Mérite.


==== Herido casi mortalmente ====
El 6 de julio de 1917 recibió una bala perdida en el cráneo, que le provocó una terrible herida lesionándole el cerebro; pero él continuó volando pese a estar claramente incapacitado para soportar alturas. Se comportaba como si fuera inmune a la muerte, no tomando precauciones e incluso violando las fundamentales reglas de vuelo que había escrito en su manual. Llevó vendada la cabeza durante mucho tiempo. Poco después recibió con alegría un Fokker Dr.I, un triplano que también pintó de rojo, y que tenía gran agilidad, aunque si se mantenía en rumbo fijo durante muchos minutos, se convertía en presa fácil.


=== Muerte ===

Según las fuentes oficiales, fue el capitán canadiense Roy Brown el que consiguió matar al piloto alemán, aunque nuevas investigaciones apuntan a que fue el soldado de infantería australiano William John ""Snowy"" Evans el que disparó desde tierra la bala del .303 que acabó con su vida. La bala entró por el lado derecho del pecho y le causó heridas en los pulmones, el hígado, el corazón, la arteria aorta y la vena cava antes de salir. Según la opinión de los forenses, apenas contó con un minuto antes de perder la consciencia y solo un par de ellos en morir. Poco se sabe sobre el soldado Evans, aparte de que murió en 1925, y probablemente falleció sin imaginar que él podía ser el causante de la muerte del piloto más famoso de la historia. Roy Brown dejó escrito un libro sobre sus combates y detalló todo sobre el último vuelo del Barón.
Fue enterrado con todos los honores militares por los mismos británicos, quienes le rindieron tributo. Su ataúd —cubierto de flores como ofrenda— fue llevado a hombros por seis miembros del escuadrón 209. En el momento del entierro, soldados australianos presentaron armas y lanzaron tres salvas en su honor. En su lápida, que se encuentra en el mismo lugar donde cayó, se puede leer su epitafio:

Aquí yace un valiente, un noble adversario y un verdadero hombre de honor. Que descanse en paz.

Tras su muerte, el mando del Jasta 11 fue asumido por Wilhelm Reinhardt, el cual murió en un accidente aéreo en julio de 1918, sucediéndole Hermann Göring, quien era uno de los ases más destacados de la aviación de caza en esos momentos, habiendo obtenido 22 victorias en la guerra.
El Barón Rojo dejó un libro, escrito en 1917, durante su convalecencia por el disparo en la cabeza. Lo tituló El avión rojo de combate, donde afirmaba que combatía en la aviación buscando una consecuencia para su vida.

353,"El Templo de Kirtland fue uno de los templos construidos y operados por La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días en el siglo XIX, siendo el primero construido por el Movimiento de los Santos de los Últimos Días en Kirtland (Ohio). Terminado en 1836, fue el único cuya construcción se completó durante la vida de José Smith, fundador del movimiento. El templo fue dedicado el 27 de marzo de 1836 por Smith y al que asistieron unas mil personas.
El Templo de Kirtland se encuentra en una colina al noreste de Ohio, a unos 25 kilómetros al este de la ciudad de Cleveland, con vistas al valle Chagrin. El diseño es mezcla de los estilos arquitectónicos federal, griego y gótico.


== Historia ==
José Smith y los primeros fieles a la iglesia SUD construyeron el Templo de Kirtland, dedicado en marzo de 1836. La propiedad cambió de dueños debido a conflictos en Ohio y Misuri, llegando a su apogeo después del martirio de Smith en 1844. Varios líderes de la era iniciaron demandas a la iglesia intentando tomar control del templo, incitando muchas batallas legales que duraron gran parte del final del siglo XIX.
En 1901, la Iglesia Reorganizada de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días (conocida ahora como Comunidad de Cristo) obtuvo legalmente la propiedad y ha trabajado deste entonces para preservar el templo en beneficio de los que están conectados con la historia y el patrimonio del mormonismo.[1]​


== Construcción ==
Los planes para la construcción del templo en la población de Kirtland fueron discutidos y luego anunciados durante sesiones de la «Escuela de Profetas» en el piso superior de la tienda de Newel K. Whitney en diciembre de 1832. La Escuela de Profetas era el antecedente a la actual ceremonia de la investidura, clásica ordenanza SUD efectuada solo en los templos de la iglesia.
Seguido el anuncio público el 27 de diciembre la iglesia decidió construir el nuevo templo en un terreno destinados a incluir un complejo de varios edificios, incluyendo un edificio para la presidencia de la iglesia, una capilla y un edificio para impresión de libros y folletos proselitistas. La ceremonia de la primera palada ocurrió el 23 de junio de 1833[2]​ y ultimadamente solo se enfocaron los esfuerzos en la construcción del templo por su naturaleza sagrada,[3]​[4]​ mientras que otros proyectos vecinos fueron cancelados.
El diseño del Templo de Kirtland fue presentado por el mismo José Smith con modificaciones menores por sus consejeros. El templo incluía una sala amplia en el piso inferior dedicado para servicios de adoración y una en el piso superior para la educación en teología restauracionista.[5]​ Al hacer el anuncio público, tanto Smith como Frederick G. Williams reportaron haber recibido las instrucciones del diseño por epifanía divina.[6]​
El diseño exterior del Templo de Kirtland tiene parecido a otras iglesias de la era en Nueva Inglaterra, fue el diseño interior el que lo distingue de otros edificios religiosos de la época.[2]​ Los púlpitos tienen cuatro niveles y están ubicados en ambos extremos del auditorio, algo único del Templo de Kirtland. Los púlpitos del extermo occidente del templo fueron designados para uso del Sacerdocio de Melquisedec, mientras que los del este eran para el uso del Sacerdocio Aarónico. Las iniciales en cada púlpito representaban el oficio del sacerdocio que el individuo sentado a ese nivel ocupaba en ese entonces. Estas iniciales ayudaron a los miembros de la Iglesia a entender la autoridad relativa del sacerdocio.[6]​


== Actualidad ==
Cada año decenas de miles hacen turismo en el templo y la villa histórica de Kirtland en el extermo este del templo, propiedad de la Iglesia SUD. La Comunidad de Cristo emplea guias para las giras del templo y la Iglesia SUD asigna misioneros para la villa histórica.[1]​ El Templo se encuentra sobre la calle Chillicothe opuesto a la capilla de la Comunidad de Cristo en Kirtland. Miembros de varias tradiciones de los Santos de los Últimos Días también viajan al templo para celebrar 50 ó 60 servicios de culto y eventos educativos cada año. También hay servicio relacionados al Día de Acción de Gracias, Navidad, y servicios de Semana Santa que se celebran en el templo cada año.
Acompañan al templo en el mismo terreno un centro de formación espiritual y un centro de visitantes abierto para el publico con énfasis a la historia y enseñanzas de la Comunidad de Cristo. Este centro, inaugurado en marzo de 2007 y dedicado el 9 de junio de 2007, aumenta el culto y los ministerios educativos y administrativos del Templo, proporcionando espacio de aulas, espacio de culto, un teatro de usos múltiples, oficinas, y exposiciones históricas y contemporáneas relacionadas con el Templo, con el Movimiento de los Santos de los Últimos Días y con la Comunidad de Cristo. El diseño básico del centro ha sido descrito por algunos como reflecting a dove. El centro refleja diversas características del Templo es en el aspecto visual. Todos los viernes a mediodía, en el Centro de Formación Espiritual de la Oración por la Paz de los viernes que se celebra se basa en la Oración Diaria por la Paz en el Templo de la Independencia.

355,"William Lawrence Francis ""Bill"" Cullen (18 de febrero de 1920 – 7 de julio de 1990), fue un presentador radiofónico y televisivo estadounidense, con una carrera que se extendió a lo largo de cinco décadas. Es conocido sobre todo por su participación en concursos presentando varios de ellos (incluyendo los originales The Price Is Right, The $25,000 Pyramid y Blockbusters), y por su intervención como miembro de debates a lo largo de veinte años en los programas I've Got a Secret y To Tell the Truth.


== Inicios ==
Cullen nació en Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Su infancia se vio marcada por la poliomielitis, que le dejó una cojera para el resto de su vida. En la mayoría de sus últimos concursos, el decorado estaba diseñado de tal modo que no tuviera que caminar apenas. Era también una característica suya el llevar unas gafas muy gruesas.
La carrera de Cullen se inició en Pittsburgh, donde trabajó en la emisora de radio WWSW. Apoyaba al periodista deportivo Joe Tucker. Era conocido por su sentido del humor y por gastar bromas a sus compañeros cuando estaban en antena. Cullen decidió buscar suerte en Nueva York y uno de sus primeros trabajos fue escribir para el programa de radio Easy Aces.


== Carrera en los concursos ==
Tras viajar a Nueva York presentó varios programas de radio, incluyendo concursos, en las décadas de 1940 y 1950. Su primer concurso televisivo fue Winner Take All,una producción de Mark Goodson y Bill Todman emitida por la CBS en 1952. Presentó las versiones diurnas y de prime-time de The Price Is Right, otra producción de Goodson y Todman, entre 1956 y 1965. También participó en debates en I've Got a Secret entre 1952 yl 1967 y después en To Tell the Truth entre 1969 y 1978. Cullen presentó la versión de Password emitida por la NBC a finales de los años setenta, conocida como Password Plus. Aunque la mayor parte de los concursos presentados por Cullen se produjeron en la Costa Este, los últimos de su carrera se rodaron en California.
Cullen presentó 23 concursos diferentes a lo largo de los años, más que cualquier otro presentador en la historia de la televisión. Entre los shows se incluyen Eye Guess en los años sesenta, Three on a Match y la versión nocturna de Pyramid en los setenta, y Chain Reaction, Blockbusters, Child's Play, Hot Potato, y The Joker's Wild en los ochenta, tras la muerte de Jack Barry.
Actuó como invitado en otros muchos concursos a lo largo de su carrera televisiva, incluyendo I've Got a Secret, Password, To Tell the Truth, Match Game, y todas las versiones de Pyramidanteriores a los 100.000 dólares en premios. Cullen también presentó varios programas piloto para su amigo el productor Bob Stewart, creador de Price, Truth y Password para Goodson-Todman y Pyramid para su propia compañía. También debatió en varios programas presentados por Bob Eubanks, incluyendo Liar's Club, Trivia Trap, Rhyme and Reason, y All Star Secrets, así como Family Feud.
En 1982 Cullen tuvo una actuación sorpresa en The Price Is Right a fin de promover su nuevo concurso, Child's Play.


=== Vida personal ===
Cullen estuvo casado tres veces. Su primer matrimonio fue muy breve y tuvo lugar mientras aún vivía en Pittsburgh. El segundo fue con la cantante Carol Ames entre 1949 y 1955. El 24 de diciembre de 1955, Cullen se casó con la antigua bailarina y modelo Ann Roemheld Macomber, hija del compositor Heinz Roemheld; este matrimonio duró hasta el fallecimiento de él. Ann actuó a menudo con Bill en Tattletales en los años setenta y ochenta.


=== Muerte ===
Cullen falleció el 7 de julio de 1990 a causa de un cáncer de pulmón.

362,"La agrimensura era, antiguamente, la rama de la topografía destinada a la delimitación de superficies, (diríase que la Topografía es una disciplina auxiliar de la Agrimensura, cuya tarea es mucho más compleja, ya que lo ""que se mide"" no son sólo ""superficies"" si no que se delimitan derechos, para lo que hay que entender acerca de los mismos -Derechos Reales, Procedimientos, etc.- y después aplicar alguna técnica de la Topografía) a la medición de áreas y a la rectificación de límites. En la actualidad, la comunidad científica internacional reconoce que es una disciplina autónoma, con estatuto propio y lenguaje específico que estudia los objetos territoriales a toda escala, y que se centra en la fijación de toda clase de límites. De este modo, produce documentos cartográficos e infraestructura virtual para establecer planos, cartas y mapas, y da publicidad a los límites de la propiedad o gubernamentales. Con el fin de cumplir su objetivo, la agrimensura se nutre de la topografía, la geometría, la ingeniería, la trigonometría, las matemáticas, la física, el derecho, la geomorfología, la edafología, la arquitectura, la historia, la computación y la teledetección.
Como definición se podría decir que, es el ''arte'' de saber medir las tierras. (Así lo cita el ''Diccionario Aristos'' de 1976)


== Origen ==

A lo largo de la evolución de esta disciplina los agrimensores se han servido de diversos instrumentos específicos de su actividad. Entre ellos se destacó durante siglos la escuadra de agrimensor, que permitía establecer las dimensiones de diferentes ángulos en varias direcciones.
La agrimensura ha sido un elemento esencial en el desarrollo del entorno humano, desde el comienzo de la historia registrada (hacia el 3000 a. C.); es un requisito en la planificación y ejecución de casi toda forma de la construcción. Sus aplicaciones, actuales, más conocidas son en el transporte, edificación, construcción, comunicaciónes, cartografía, y la definición de los límites legales de la propiedad de terrenos.
Las técnicas de la agrimensura se han aplicado a lo largo de gran parte de nuestra historia escrita. En el Antiguo Egipto, cuando el Nilo inundaba los campos de cultivo que se encontraban en sus riberas, se establecieron límites utilizando la geometría. La casi perfecta cuadratura y orientación norte-sur de la Gran Pirámide de Guiza, construida hacia el 2570 a. C., confirma que los egipcios dominaban la agrimensura.
Registro de tierras en Egipto (3000 a. C.)
Bajo los Romanos los agrimensores se establecieron como una profesión, y crearon las divisiones básicas del imperio, así como el registro de los impuestos de las tierras conquistadas (sobre el año 300 d. C.)
En Inglaterra, el Domesday Book por Guillermo I de Inglaterra (1086)
Las técnicas cubrían toda Inglaterra.
Figuran nombres de los propietarios de las tierras, superficie, calidad de la tierra, e información específica sobre el contenido de la zona y sus habitantes.
No incluía mapas mostrando la exacta localización de las tierras. (Las primeras topografías se dieron en la época del Imperio Egipcio, alrededor de 1400 a. C.)

El catastro de la Europa continental se creó en 1808.
Creado por Napoleón Bonaparte, ""Un buen catastro será mi mayor logro en mi derecho civil"", de Napoleón I
Contenía el número de parcelas de la tierra, su uso su valor...
100 millones de parcelas de tierra, se triangularon y midieron haciéndose mapas a escala de 1:2500 y 1:1250
Rápida propagación por Europa, pero sobre todo debido a los problemas en los países del Mediterráneo, los Balcanes y Europa oriental tuvieron gastos de mantenimiento del catastro con numerosos conflictos.

Las mediciones a gran escala son un prerrequisito para realizar un mapa. A fines de 1780, un equipo de la cartografía de Gran Bretaña, inicialmente bajo el General William Roy comenzó la Principal de la triangulación de Bretaña utilizando el teodolito Ramsden.
En España, en el siglo XIX, Javier de Burgos apoyó la creación de las Academias de las Nobles Artes, para expedir títulos de agrimensor.


== Técnicas ==

Históricamente, se midieron distancias de múltiples formas; como unir los puntos con cadenas de una longitud conocida, por ejemplo, la cadena de Gunter o cintas de acero o invar. Con el fin de medir las distancias horizontales, estas cadenas o cintas se tensaban de acuerdo a la temperatura, para reducir el pandeo y la holgura.
Los ángulos horizontales se midieron utilizando una brújula, que proporciona una declinación magnética que se podía medir. Este tipo de instrumento posteriormente se mejoró, con unos discos inscritos con mejor resolución angular, así como el montar telescopios con retículos para ver con más precisión encima del disco. Además, se añadieron círculos calibrados que permitían medir de ángulos verticales, junto con los verniers para medir las fracciones de grado.
El método más simple para medir alturas es con un altímetro (básicamente un barómetro); utilizando la presión del aire como indicador de alturas. Pero para la agrimensura se necesitaba mejorar la precisión. Con este fin se han desarrollado una multitud de variantes, tales como los niveles exactos. Los niveles son calibrados para dar un plano exacto de diferencias de alturas entre el instrumento y el punto en cuestión que se mide, por lo general, mediante el uso de una barra de medición vertical.
A finales de los 1990s se utilizaban como herramientas básicas en la agrimensura sobre el terreno, la cinta métrica para medir las distancias más cortas o diferencias de cotas; y un teodolito fijado en un trípode para medir ángulos (horizontales y verticales), en combinación con la triangulación. Partiendo de un punto de referencia, donde se conoce su ubicación y cota, se miden distancias y los ángulos de otros de los que se quiere conocer su ubicación y cota. Un instrumento más moderno es la estación total, que es un teodolito electrónico con un dispositivo de medición de distancia (EDM). Desde la introducción de las estaciones totales se han ido cambiando los todos dispositivos ópticos y mecánicos por electrónicos, con un ordenador portátil y software. Las modernas estaciones top-of-the-line ya no requieren un reflector o prisma (utilizados para devolver los pulsos de luz al medir distancias) para devolver las mediciones de distancia, son totalmente autómatas, y puede incluso enviar un e-mail con los datos al ordenador de la oficina y conectarse a un sistema global de navegación por satélite, tales como el conocido GPS. Aunque los sistemas GPS han aumentado la velocidad en la toma de datos de la agrimensura, todavía solo tienen una precisión de unos 20 mm. Además los sistemas GPS no funcionan en zonas con una densa arbolada. Es por esto que las estaciones totales no han eliminado por completo los instrumentos anteriores. La robótica permite a los agrimensores recoger mediciones precisas sin tener que contratar a más trabajadores, mirando a través del telescopio o grabar datos. Una forma más rápida de medir (sin obstáculos) es ir en un helicóptero con localización acústica por láser, combinado con el GPS para determinar la altura del helicóptero. Para aumentar la precisión, se colocan balizas en el suelo (a unos 20 km). Este método alcanza una precisión de unos 5 mm.
Con el método de triangulación, lo primero que se tiene que conocer es la distancia horizontal al objeto. Si no se conoce o no se puede medir directamente, se calcula como se explica en el artículo triangulación. Entonces, la altura de un objeto se puede obtener mediante la medición del ángulo entre la horizontal y la línea que une un punto a una distancia conocida y la parte superior del objeto. Para determinar la altura de una montaña, se debe tomar como referencia el nivel del mar, pero aquí las distancias pueden ser demasiado grandes y la montaña puede que no se vea. Así pues, en primer lugar se debe determinar la posición de un punto, entonces vamos hasta ese punto y realizamos una medición relativa, y así sucesivamente hasta que se alcance la cima de montaña.


== Agrimensura como carrera ==
Los principios básicos de la agrimensura han cambiado poco a lo largo de los siglos, pero los instrumentos utilizados por los agrimensores han evolucionado enormemente. La ingeniería, en especial la ingeniería civil, depende en gran medida de los agrimensores. Siempre hay caminos, diques, muros de contención, puentes o zonas residenciales por construir, donde los agrimensores están involucrados. Determinan los límites de la propiedad privada y los límites de las distintas divisiones políticas. También ofrecen asesoramiento y datos para los sistemas de información geográfica (SIG), bases de datos informatizadas que contienen información sobre las características y límites del terreno..
Los agrimensores deberán poseer un conocimiento minucioso de física, álgebra, cálculo básico, geometría y trigonometría. También deben conocer las leyes que regulan los catastros, la propiedad y los contratos. Además, deben ser capaces de utilizar los delicados instrumentos con exactitud y precisión, de modo que estos puedan contribuir con una buena información para fines de registros inmobiliarios y de ingeniería aplicable a la construcción estructural y de vías.

364,"Once (por Once de Septiembre) es la denominación no oficial de una zona del barrio de Balvanera, en la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Es un barrio no oficial, ya que no se encuentra entre los 48 barrios en que legalmente está dividida la ciudad.
Durante el siglo XIX, Balvanera era considerada un suburbio de Buenos Aires. Un censo de 1836 estimaba su población en 3625 habitantes. Casi todos vivían en quintas (pequeñas fincas), por lo que la zona era conocida como las quintas. Su avenida principal, hacia el oeste, era el Camino Real del Oeste, actualmente Avenida Rivadavia.
En 1775 empezaron a funcionar los Corrales de Miserere que se situaban en lo que hoy es la plaza Miserere y la estación del ferrocarril (llegaban hasta la Avenida Corrientes hacia el norte y de Avenida Pueyrredón a la calle Ecuador), que en 1806 y 1807 fueron escenario de las Invasiones Inglesas.
Once se caracteriza por sus numerosos comercios de ofertas y bajos precios, y abarca varias áreas comerciales. Su nombre proviene de la terminal de ferrocarril situada en el centro de la zona, Once de Septiembre que a su vez viene del 11 de septiembre de 1852, fecha en la que el Estado de Buenos Aires se separó del resto de la Argentina. Posee una gran presencia de la colectividad judía. Los judíos en esta zona son tradicionalmente fabricantes de telas y comerciantes. También alberga varias sinagogas, colegios y clubes judíos. Durante la crisis el año 2001, a causa de la migración de muchos judíos porteños a Israel, su población en el barrio disminuyó sensiblemente.
Por otro lado, en la plaza se encuentra el mausoleo de Bernardino Rivadavia, primer presidente argentino.
Existen en la zona importantes corrientes migratorias provenientes de Corea del Sur y Perú.

367,"Una route nationale, o simplemente nationale, es una de las autovías principales de Francia. Estas autovías son muy importantes en el país galo ya que cruzan amplias porciones del territorio francés, en oposición a los caminos secundarios o comunales que sirven solamente a áreas locales.
Su uso suele ser gratuito, excepto en el caso de tener que pasar por alguna autopista de peaje. Están abiertas a los vehículos en general, excepto en ciertas secciones que tienen el estatus de autopista (autoroute).
Francia cuenta con alrededor de 30.500 km de nacionales de propiedad no privada. Para comparar digamos que las Routes départementales recorren una distancia total de 365,000 km. El trazado de las carreteras en el país francés refleja la gran tradición centralista: la mayoría de ellos dejan las puertas de París. De hecho, las autovías principales de Francia comienzan en la puerta de Notre-Dame en el km Cero.


== Historia ==
El sistema data del 16 de diciembre de 1811, cuando Napoleón designó un número a las routes impériales (carreteras imperiales). Las carreteras de primera clase fueron numeradas del 1 al 14; todas empezaban en París, en el sentido de las agujas del reloj. Route 1 iba desde el norte de París a Calais, y es aún la trayectoria general de la route nationale 1. Las carreteras de segunda clase, desde la 15 a la 27, eran lo mismo, mientras que la carreteras de segunda clase desde la 28 a la 229 tenían peores conexiones. Durante la Restauración Borbónica, en 1824, esas carreteras fueron renombradas como routes royales (carreteras reales) y modificadas. Route 3, de París a Hamburgo vía Soissons, Reims y Lieja, fue renumerada como 31 y 51, y las subsiguientes carreteras fueron bajadas un número. Las routes 19 y 20 quedaron completamente fuera de la Francia post-napoleónica, y así de la 21 a la 27 pasaron a ser de la 18 a la 24. En 1830 estas carreteras fueron renombradas routes nationales.[1]​

373,"""Art Crawl"" es el octavo episodio de la primera temporada de la serie animada de TV Bob's Burgers. Se emitió originalmente por Fox en Estados Unidos el 20 de marzo de 2011.
Fue escrito por Lizzie Molyneux & Wendy Molyneux y dirigido por Kyounghee Lim. Recibió críticas positivas por la interacción de personajes, bromas y argumento. De acuerdo a las mediciones de audiencia, fue visto por 4,43 millones de hogares en su emisión original. Cuenta con actuaciones invitadas de Andy Kindler, Jerry Minor, Megan Mullally, Larry Murphy, Sam Seder, Laura Silverman y Sarah Silverman.


== Argumento ==
Bob y sus hijos pasean por la muestra anual de arte de la ciudad criticando las pinturas para evitar a Gayle (Megan Mullally), la frágil hermana de Linda, que está colgando sus cuadros en el restaurante. Louise se sorprende cuando alguien compra una pintura en una tienda que odia y es desterrada por la anciana pareja directora de la muestra, Edith y Harold (Larry Murphy y Sam Seder). Bob y los chicos vuelven a casa y descubren que la inspiración de Gayle para pintar ha sido el ano de los animales.
Bob se preocupa pensando que perderá clientes por las pinturas pero Linda quiere que Gayle esté feliz con su arte que luego será quitado una vez que termine la muestra en unos pocos días. Louise opina que las pinturas de la feria son malas, coloca un puesto de arte afuera del restaurante y fuerza a sus hermanos a pintar arte 'basura' para obtener dinero fácil. Veintisiete minutos después, Gene completa el cuadro por el que tanto trabajó en el que un robot ninja pelea contra una grabadora vampiro en Stonehenge con su amigo albino y Tina hace lo suyo pintando a su dentista desnudo. Aunque a Louise no le gustan, luego acepta dejarlos pintar en forma realista y Gene debe cortarse una de sus orejas tal como lo hizo Vincent van Gogh. Por suerte Bob interrumpe el corte y cuelga las pinturas de los chicos para reemplazar los anos sabiendo que a Linda le gustará el trabajo artístico de los chicos. Bob se dirige a Gayle para decirle por qué sacó los cuadros cuando llegan Edith y Harold a prohibirle que exhiba las pinturas de anos dado que son ofensivos; esto hace que Bob cambie de opinión y los ahuyente utilizando los cuadros. Luego declara que el suyo será un 'restaurante de anos' al colgarlos nuevamente y pidiendo a Gayle que pinte más. Mientras tanto, la venta de Louise no va nada bien y reemplaza a Gene y Tina con sus compañeros Red y los mellizos Andy y Ollie Pesto (Laura y Sarah Silverman). Edith y Harold continúan protestando y Bob les dice que serán una instalación permanente.
A la mañana siguiente Bob descubre que han pintado ropa interior rosa sobre los anos y culpa a Edith por vandalismo. El negocio de Louise tiene éxito pero se vuelve autoritaria y comienza a mandonear a los chicos; en eso ve que Bob entra a la tienda de Edith y Harold que funciona como cabecera de la feria y lo acompaña para descubrir que Tina y Gene están aprendiendo a pintar. Bob exige una disculpa pero Edith y Harold no comprenden lo que sucede haciendo que aquél pinte anos (en realidad puntos negros) en los cuadros ajenos. Luego es arrestado por las oficiales Julia y Cliffany por pintarrajear la propiedad de Edith pero se revela que fue Linda la que censuró las pinturas. Explica que tuvo alucinaciones frecuentes con anos de animales (una parodia del segmento de los elefantes rosados de la película Dumbo) y por eso les pintó la ropa interior rosa. Aunque la verdad salió a la luz Bob aún tiene que pagar por su vandalismo; allí Louise se hace cargo con el dinero que ganó de su feria. Las oficiales y los ancianos se marchan mientras que Gayle, para sorpresa de la familia, modifica sus pinturas añadiéndoles senos. El episodio finaliza con Andy y Ollie de noche solos en el puesto de Louise. Cuando acuerdan que uno de los dos debe irse, llega Louise y vuelven rápidamente a pintar.


== Recepción ==
En su emisión original en Estados Unidos, ""Art Crawl"" fue visto por un estimado de 4,43 millones de hogares y recibió una medición de 2.2/6% del share en adultos entre 18-49 años, un incremento desde el episodio anterior.[1]​
El episodio recibió críticas positivas. Rowan Kaiser de A. V. Club lo calificó con una A, el más alto de la noche y de la temporada. Le gustaron la historia, el humor y alabó la mejora en la serie en general resaltando el papel más gracioso de Bob.

374,"El AgustaWestland AW109 (anteriormente conocido como Agusta A109) es un helicóptero , desarrollado por la compañía italiana Agusta, desde 2000 parte de AgustaWestland (fusionada, a su vez, en Finmeccanica a partir de 2016 entonces Leonardo),[1]​ para uso civil y militar. Se trata de un helicóptero ligero de 6 u 8 plazas bimotor de tren retráctil. El AW119 Koala es una versión monomotor con patines del AW109.


== Diseño y desarrollo ==
En la década de 1960 Agusta diseñó el A 109 como un helicóptero comercial de un solo turboeje Turbomeca Astazou XII de 690 cv. Pronto se dieron cuenta que se necesitaba primordialmente por consideraciones de seguridad de un diseño bimotor, por lo que fue rediseñado en 1967 para ser propulsado con dos turboejes Allison 250-C14 de 370 cv. El proyecto del modelo A 109B para usos militares fue abandonado en 1969 y la empresa se concentró en la versión civil de ocho plazas A 109C Hirundo (Golondrina). El primero de los tres prototipos hizo su vuelo inaugural el 4 de agosto de 1971. Después de un desarrollo prolongado, el primer ejemplar de preserie se completó en abril de 1975, y la entrega de los primeros aparatos de serie llamados A 109A comenzó a principios de 1976. El helicóptero se convirtió en un éxito y pronto fue utilizado para otras funciones tales como transporte ligero, ambulancia aérea y misiones de búsqueda y rescate. En 1975 Agusta regresó de nuevo a la posibilidad de una versión militar y y realizo un acuerdo con la firma Hughes Aircraft fabricante de misiles TOW. Los ensayos se llevaron a cabo entre 1976 y 1977 con cinco A 109A equipados con misiles Hughes TOW. Dos variantes militares se desarrollaron entonces, una de ataque ligero, antiblindados y apoyo cercano y otra para operaciones navales.
La venta de Agusta A 109 a las fuerzas armadas belgas en 1988 dio lugar a un escándalo de soborno cuando se denunció que la empresa había dado al Partido Socialista Belga más de 50 millones de francos belgas para conseguir la venta. Este escándalo provocó la renuncia y condena del Secretario General de la OTAN, Willy Claes.
El A 109 se cambió su designación a AW109 después de que en julio de 2000 se realizara la fusión de Finmeccanica SpA (a partir de 2017 Leonardo)[2]​ y GKN plc con sus respectivas subsidiarias de helicópteros: Agusta y Westland Helicopters formaran AgustaWestland (que en 2016 se fusionó en Leonardo-Finmeccanica).
En agosto de 2008, Scott Kasprowicz y Steve Sheik rompieron el récord de velocidad alrededor del mundo con un AgustaWestland Grand estándar, con un tiempo de 11 días, 7 horas y 2 minutos. El Grand A109S es también el helicóptero más rápido desde Nueva York a Los Ángeles.

378,"La iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia se sitúa en el barrio de Campanar, antiguo municipio integrado a la ciudad de Valencia en 1897. Se trata de un templo de estilo barroco. La parroquia fue instaurada en 1507 sobre una antigua ermita. En 1603 se inauguró una pequeña capilla construida con motivo del hallazgo de la Virgen de Campanar en 1596.
Es a finales del siglo XVII cuando se inicia la ampliación del presbiterio, la construcción del trasagrario y la nueva planta de la capilla de la comunión, siguiendo los postulados del barroco. A esta renovación corresponde también el inicio de la construcción del campanario y el trasagrario de planta rectangular, con acceso directo por dos puertas laterales junto al altar mayor.
El templo está cubierto por una bóveda de cañón, dividida en tres secciones por cuatro arcos fajones, que dan lugar en su centro a una singular bóveda vaída. Sus paramentos están decorados con magníficas pinturas al fresco, atribuidas a Dionisio Vidal.
Finalmente en 1741 se inician las obras de conclusión del campanario, contratadas con el maestro de obras José Mínguez; cuya fábrica de considerables proporciones estructurales, ejemplifica una nueva tipología de torres campanarios caracterizados por el desarrollo de un potente remate escalonado de dos cuerpos con aletas de enlace y coronado por un chapitel de tejas vidriadas. Es en ese momento cuando debió reformarse la fachada, rematada por un potente perfil mixtilíneo de evidente tradición setecentista, en conexión con ciertos elementos decorativos de la capilla de la virgen. Posteriormente la iglesia ha sido repristinado con estucos y dorados que le confieren un cierto carácter decimonónico.
El campanario fue restaurado, con recuperación de su cromatismo original, a finales de los años 80 del siglo XX.

379,"Anoura fistulata es una especie de murciélago filostómido endémico de Ecuador. Fue descrito en el año 2005.[2]​


== Descripción ==
Tiene una longitud total de unos 6 cm y un peso de unos 12 g; tiene un hocico corto, la cola mide 5 mm de longitud y su uropatagio tiene forma de V invertida. Su nombre específico, fistulata tiene su origen en la palabra latina fistŭla, que significa tubo o canal, debido al labio inferior de este murciélago que se extiende 3,3-4,8 mm más allá del labio superior y está enrollado en forma de tubo. La función exacta de su labio en forma de tubo es desconocida. Su lengua es el doble de larga que la de otras especies del género Anoura y, con 8 cm de longitud (el 150% de la longitud total de su cuerpo), este murciélago tiene la lengua más larga en relación a su tamaño corporal de todos los mamíferos.[2]​[3]​
Por evolución convergente, esta especie, los pangolines y el oso hormiguero gigante (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), tienen lenguas separadas de su hueso hioides y se extienden a través de la faringe profundamente en el tórax;[4]​ esta extensión está entre el esternón y la tráquea.


== Alimentación ==
Se alimenta fundamentalmente de néctar y polen de varias plantas, y complementa su dieta con insectos.[2]​[3]​ La extraordinaria longitud se su lengua podría haber coevolucionado con las largas flores que poliniza, en especial con Centropogon nigricans.[4]​[5]​


== Distribución ==
Su área de distribución se restringe a los Andes ecuatorianos, y habita en bosques nubosos montanos a una altitud de 1300-1890 m en las laderas orientales y de 2000-2275 m en las occidentales.[1]​[2]​

381,"Parental Control es un reality show producido por MTV. Dirigido por Brendon Carter y Bruce Klassen, también son creadores de otros programas del mismo canal.
En Asia, el programa fue transmitido en Canal V, en el período de 2007-2009.


== Argumento ==
La versión que se emitió febrero de 2006, difiere de su estreno en MTV Spring Break de marzo del 2005. Una niña fue a entrevistar a cinco niños, y después de una serie de cinco preguntas para cada persona o una actividad de algún tipo, sí al padre no le gusta alguien, se eliminará a uno de los concursantes. Esto continúa hasta que un competidor se mantuvo.
En la última versión, los padres no están contentos con el actual novio/novia o pareja de su hijo/a. La entrevista de los padres debian seleccionar los posibles novios/novias que compiten por el afecto de su hijo/a. Posteriormente, su hijo va a una cita con los selecciones que cada padre eligió. El chico tiene que decidir si desea mantener su relación actual, quedarse solo, o elegir una de las nuevas perspectivas.
En cada fecha, los padres y la actual pareja deben ver y comentar, a menudo al antagónico, como la fecha se desarrolla en la televisión. Cuando las fechas se haya terminado, el chico selecciona su nueva pareja, de entre los competidores y la pareja actual. En primer lugar, uno de los tres se elimina antes de dejar a los otros dos. Entonces el chico elige entre las dos parejas potenciales restantes. Todo el proceso a menudo resulta en un comportamiento desagradable de los dos que fueron eliminados. Por lo general, la actual novia/novio se selecciona. En algunas ocasiones, el chico decide quedarse solo, y elimina a la compañera actual y las fechas en que sus padres orquestaron.


=== Calificaciones ===
Aparte de las vacaciones de primavera de 2005, estreno (que sólo tuvo un episodio), el espectáculo se estrenó en febrero de 2006 como un programa de reemplazo de la primavera, sin mucho bombo ni anuncios. El espectáculo, al igual que otros programas de MTV de citas (Siguiente y Date My Mom ), comenzó con pocos espectadores y creció a un espectáculo de feria de mayor puntaje.
La primera temporada terminó al aire nuevos programas en torno a junio de 2006, para hacer más espacio para nuevas temporadas de Hecho , los Raiders de habitación , y luego, e iniciar la nueva serie de televisión ¿Por qué no puedo ser tú?. La segunda temporada comenzó a finales de ese año en octubre.
En marzo de 2007, una nueva serie fue filmada en el Reino Unido.

383,"Christopher Alexander ( n. 4 de octubre de 1936 en Viena, Austria) es un arquitecto, reconocido por sus diseños destacados de edificios en California, Japón y México. Partiendo de la premisa de que los usuarios de los espacios arquitectónicos saben más que los arquitectos sobre el tipo de edificios que necesitan, creó y validó (junto a Sarah Ishikawa y Murray Silverstein) el término lenguaje de patrón, un método estructurado que pone la arquitectura al alcance de personas no especializadas profesionalmente en la materia, y que popularizó en su libro A Pattern Language. Alexander actualmente vive en Inglaterra, donde es un contratista y arquitecto licenciado. Además, es profesor emérito de la Universidad de California en Berkeley.


== Biografía ==
Christopher Alexander creció en Inglaterra. Cursó sus estudios en la Universidad de Cambridge, donde obtuvo los títulos de Máster en Matemática (1956) y licenciado en Arquitectura (1958). Con posterioridad se trasladó a Estados Unidos donde se doctoró en arquitectura (1963) en la Universidad de Harvard (el primer título PhD otorgado para la carrera de arquitectura en la Universidad). Tuvo como maestro a Serge Chermayeff, con el que colaboró después en algunas de sus obras.
Durante la misma época, trabajó en el MIT (en teoría de la transportación y ciencias de la computación) y en Harvard en cognición y estudios congnitivos. En 1963 se convirtió en profesor de arquitectura en la Universidad de Berkeley, donde ocupó varios cargos hasta el 2001: de 1965 a 1966 ocupó el cargo de profesor de investigación en humanidades; desde 1967 fundó y dirigió el Center for Environmental Structure, y desde 1970 fue profesor de arquitectura.
Alexander ha sido reconocido como el padre del movimiento ""pattern language"" en ciencias de la computación. Adicionalmente, en 1996 fue electo como miembro de la American Academy of Arts and Sciences por sus contribuciones a la arquitectura.


== Contribuciones teóricas a la arquitectura ==
En su libro The Timeless Way of Building (El modo intemporal de construir), aboga por una arquitectura en íntima fusión con la Naturaleza y formula su teoría del pattern language (lenguaje de patrón), la cual ofrece una serie de fórmulas para que, a tenor de las propias necesidades individuales o culturales, cada miembro o grupo humano pueda construir su propia vivienda o conjunto habitable sin necesidad de arquitectos, que, en su propuesta, actuarían únicamente como una ayuda para la construcción.[1]​
En el mismo libro, Alexander afirma que el modo intemporal de construir es el que la gente ha usado durante miles de años, al construir sus propios edificios, dando lugar a poblaciones muy armónicas y bellas. Por eso, ""partiendo de la base de que la vida es una realidad dinámico-temporal, prevé la permanente renovación del lenguaje de patrones, a fin de adaptarlos a las nuevas exigencias arquitectónicas de las futuras generaciones"".[2]​ En consecuencia, ha calificado a la Arquitectura moderna, con su control detallado y definido del proceso de construcción, como ""ridícula"" y ""estrecha e inhumana, una psicosis pasajera en la historia de la creación del hombre"".[3]​


=== Un lenguaje de patrones ===

Profundizó su teoría del lenguaje de patrón en su libro A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction, en el que describía un sistema práctico de arquitectura en una forma que un matemático teórico o un científico de la computación llamaría gramática generativa.
La inspiración del libro fueron las ciudades medievales: atractivas y armoniosas. Según los autores, tienen esas cualidades porque fueron construidas según regulaciones locales que requerían ciertas características, pero que permitían al arquitecto adaptarlas a situaciones particulares.
En el libro se suministran reglas e imágenes, y se recomienda que las decisiones sobre la construcción del edificio se tomen de acuerdo al ambiente preciso del proyecto. Se describen métodos exactos para construir diseños prácticos, seguros y atractivos a cualquier escala, desde regiones enteras hasta la simple perilla de una puerta. Un aspecto notable del libro es que el sistema arquitectónico mostrado consiste únicamente de patrones clásicos probados en el mundo real y reseñados por múltiples arquitectos por su practicidad y belleza.
Este método fue adoptado por la Universidad de Oregón, como es descrito en el libro The Oregon Experiment, y hasta ahora lo utiliza como método de planificación oficial. También ha sido adoptado en parte por varias ciudades como un código de construcción. La idea del lenguaje de patrón aparentemente es aplicable a cualquier tarea de ingeniería compleja, y de hecho ha sido aplicada en varias de ellas. También ha sido bastante influyente en el campo de la ingeniería de software.
Christopher Alexander da la siguiente definición de patrón: “Cada patrón describe un problema que ocurre una y otra vez en nuestro entorno, para describir después el núcleo de la solución a ese problema, de tal manera que esa solución pueda ser usada más de un millón de veces sin hacerlo ni siquiera dos veces de la misma forma”.
Propone, así, un paradigma para la arquitectura basado en tres conceptos: la cualidad, la puerta y el camino.
La Cualidad (la Cualidad Sin Nombre): la esencia de todas las cosas vivas y útiles que nos hacen sentir vivos, nos da satisfacción y mejora la condición humana.
La Puerta: el mecanismo que nos permite alcanzar la calidad. Se manifiesta como un lenguaje común de patrones. La puerta es el conducto hacia la calidad.
El Camino (El Camino Eterno): siguiendo el camino, se puede atravesar la puerta para llegar a la calidad.


== 15 Principios de Christopher Alexander ==
La obra de Alexander, Nature of Order, se caracteriza por una cualidad especial que él llamaba "" la cualidad sin nombre"", después llamada ""totalidad"". Esta cualidad se relaciona con los seres humanos e induce sentimientos de pertenencia al lugar y a la estructura. Esta cualidad se encuentra en la mayoría de los edificios históricos y espacios urbanos, y es precisamente lo que Alexander intenta capturar en sus sofisticadas teorías matemáticas de diseño. A continuación se presentan 15 propiedades estructurales fundamentales de la totalidad, que se ha identificado que son bastante recurrentes y determinan el carácter de los sistemas vivos:
Niveles de Escala: la escala se refiere a la forma en que percibimos el tamaño de un elemento o espacio en relación con otras formas a su alrededor. Es la relación de los elementos más pequeños que determina el carácter y el grado de la vida del conjunto. Lo que se puede aplicar a nivel micro, se puede aplicar a nivel macro y es importante que los saltos entre diferentes escalas no sean demasiado grandes o demasiado pequeños.
Centros Fuertes: en lugar de la visión tradicional de una geometría aislados en el espacio, un verdadero centro se define no sólo por su cohesión interna, sino por su relación con el contexto. Un centro fuerte sólo puede ocurrir cuando otros centros lo están intensificando, es decir, de algo importante fluye todo lo demás.
Límites: la articulación de una forma depende en gran medida de cómo sus superficies se definen y se encuentran en los bordes. Es una división, ya sea física o simbólica, que marca una separación entre lo que es posible realizar y lo que no lo es.
Repetición Alternada: repetición de elementos recurrentes en una composición según su proximidad a la otra, y por las características visuales que comparten. Los elementos no tienen por qué ser perfectamente idénticos para agruparse de manera repetitiva, deben compartir simplemente un rasgo común.
Espacio positivo: se refiere a espacio en forma. Cuando un elemento se produce en el espacio, el elemento no sólo existe con su propia forma, sino que también actúa para definir la forma del espacio alrededor de ella. Para que algo sea conjunto, tanto el elemento en sí y el espacio que lo rodea debe comprometerse el uno al otro, cada uno debe intensificar la otra.
Buena Forma: la principal característica de identificación de la forma como resultado de la configuración específica de las superficies y los bordes. Una buena forma que ocurre cuando las superficies y los bordes de una forma tienen fuertes centros en cada parte de sí mismos, que sea placentero y claro.
Simetrías Locales: distribución equilibrada de formas equivalentes o espacios alrededor de una línea o punto común, se puede organizar elementos en la arquitectura de dos maneras: toda una organización puede hacerse simétrica, o una condición simétrica pueden ocurrir en sólo una parte del edificio. El último caso es lo que nos referimos como la simetría local.
Entrelazado Profundo: fortalece los centros de ambos lados, que se intensifican por el nuevo centro formado entre los dos. Como el Efecto Gatillo de Varela, un escritor escribe y al igual hace imágenes.
Contrastes: es la diferencia entre opuestos que da a luz a algo. El contraste es lo que a menudo da a otros principios de su grado de la vida. El contraste fortalece centros por lo que cada uno es una entidad más profunda de sí mismo, y lo que da un significado más profundo a ambos.
Variación Gradual: las cosas se organizan y varían en tamaño, espacio, intensidad y carácter. Una cualidad cambia lentamente, no de golpe, a través del espacio para convertirse en otro.
Asperosidad:es la forma extraña, el espaciado irregular, el cambio en el patrón en la esquina. La percepción humana está acostumbrada a la regularidad y la perfección de producción masiva, un objeto con rugosidad es a menudo más preciso, puesto que se trata acerca de prestar atención a lo que más importa, dejando de lado lo que importa menos.
Ecos: todos los diversos elementos de los que están hechos los centros más grandes tienen una cierta similitud de carácter. Hay profundas similitudes internas que unen a todos los elementos en diferentes escalas para formar una unidad cohesiva del ser.
Vacío: los objetos o elementos que tienen la mayor profundidad, generan un área de profunda calma y la quietud. Un vacío delimitado y contrastado por centros intensos alrededor de ella, ofrece una calma, alivia el zumbido y fortalece el centro.
Calma Interior: los seres vivos tienden a tener una simplicidad especial. Lo que hace la simplicidad es eliminar los agentes sin sentido de un elemento, lo que a menudo distraen y confunden su verdadera naturaleza. Cuando se hace esto, un objeto está en un estado de calma interior.
No Separación: es el grado de conexión que tiene un elemento con todo lo que está a su alrededor. Una cosa que tiene esta cualidad se siente completamente en paz porque está tan profundamente interconectado con su mundo.[4]​

384,"Rosario Cabrera López (Ciudad de México, 5 de junio de 1901-Progreso, Yucatán, 30 de diciembre de 1975).[1]​ Ingresó a la Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes en 1916, donde estudió con los pintores Saturnino Herrán, Leandro Izaguirre, Germán Gedovius y al escultor Arnulfo Domínguez Bello, entre otros. En diciembre de 1920 participó en la exposición anual de su escuela y el pintor Carlos Mérida comentó sobre su obra: “es digno de mencionarse el envío de la señorita Rosario Cabrera, consistente en varios retratos, que acusan a un temperamento, y algunos paisajes de los cuales uno malo, el del claustro de color sucio y de pobre factura, y el otro —un apunte— bello de color y atrevida factura”.[2]​ Un año después tuvo su primera muestra individual en la misma institución, donde presentó alrededor de cincuenta obras. En 1924 asistió al Ex Convento de Churubusco, que posteriormente se convertiría en una de las Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre (EPAL). De noviembre de 1924 a enero de 1927 vivió en Europa, becada por la Secretaría de Educación Pública. A su regreso a México entabló amistad con el pintor Alfredo Ramos Martínez, fundador de las EPAL, y otros pintores que como ella se convertirían en maestros de estas escuelas.[3]​
A finales de la década de 1920, las EPAL estaban siendo cuestionadas sobre sus propósitos y vigencia, y Rosario Cabrera fue una de las artistas que asumió su defensa, convirtiéndose en la primera —y única— pintora que dirigió dos de estas escuelas. Tras el cierre definitivo de las EPAL, se concentró en la enseñanza de pintura y dibujo en escuelas primarias.
El paisaje y el retrato fueron una constante en su obra, en los que encontró distintas propuestas de expresión. Se trata de una de las artistas que formaron parte del llamado renacimiento mexicano.[4]​

385,"El Boeing Model 15 fue avión de caza biplano monoplaza de cabina abierta estadounidense de los años 20 del siglo XX, fabricado por la compañía Boeing. El Model 15 entró en servicio con el Servicio Aéreo del Ejército de los Estados Unidos (como la serie PW-9) y con la Armada de los Estados Unidos como caza embarcado (serie FB).


== Desarrollo y diseño ==
El diseño del Model 15 estaba basado en estudios del Fokker D.VII,[1]​ de los que se llevaron 142 a los Estados Unidos para evaluaciones como parte del Acuerdo del Armisticio al acabar la Primera Guerra Mundial. Muchas de las características eran similares. El Model 15 tenía un fuselaje de tubería de acero soldada arriostrado con cables de piano, mientras que las ahusadas alas fueron fabricadas con una estructura de madera, con largueros de abeto y caoba, y costillas de madera de tres capas. Los montantes alares cambiaron de la madera normal usada en los diseños de Boeing a aerodinámicos tubos de acero. El tren de aterrizaje tenía un eje recto, siendo aerodinámico dentro de un ala de pequeña cuerda (410 mm).[2]​
El motor original era un Wright-Hispano de 300 hp (220 kW), pero cuando el Curtiss D-12 refrigerado por líquido de 435 hp (324 kW) estuvo disponible, el avión fue rediseñado, moviendo el radiador del morro a un ""túnel"" bajo el motor.[1]​ Junto con otros cambios menores en las alas, el diseño fue finalizado el 10 de enero de 1922.[2]​
El Ejército mostró interés en el nuevo diseño, y estuvo de acuerdo en proveer de armamento, motores, y en probar el avión, mientras dejaba a Boeing los derechos del avión y el diseño. El contrato fue firmado el 4 de abril de 1923,[1]​ y el primer prototipo, designado XPW-9 por ""Persecución eXperimental, motor refrigerado por Agua"", voló el 2 de junio de 1923.[3]​ El XPW-9 compitió con el Curtiss Model 33 por los contratos de aviones de persecución para reemplazar al Thomas-Morse MB-3A en el Servicio Aéreo del Ejército de los Estados Unidos.[3]​
Finalmente, ambos modelos fueron aceptados, el avión Curtiss fue designado PW-8 y el Model 15, PW-9. El Servicio Aéreo prefería el PW-9, que superaba al PW-8 en todas las prestaciones excepto en la velocidad, y estaba construido con un diseño más robusto y más fácil de mantener, ordenando 113 aviones (sólo fueron comprados 25 PW-8).[1]​ También fue desarrollada una versión naval, designada FB, y fueron producidos 44 aviones.


=== Historia de producción ===
De los 158 aviones construidos, 147 fueron aviones estándar de producción, y los restantes fueron aviones desarrollados para intereses específicos.
Las tiradas de producción se presentan abajo, con las designaciones PW para los aviones del Ejército, y las designaciones FB, para los de la Armada.


== Variantes ==

== Historia operacional ==
Las entregas de los primeros 25 PW-9 comenzaron el 30 de octubre de 1925.[4]​ Boeing entregó un total de 114 PW-9 de todas las variantes incluyendo prototipos al Servicio Aéreo del Ejército de los Estados Unidos entre 1925 y febrero de 1931. Virtualmente todos los PW-9 sirvieron con unidades de ultramar, en Hawái con el 5th Composite Group en Luke Field y más tarde con el 18th Pursuit Group en Wheeler Field,[5]​ y en Filipinas con el 4th Composite Group en Clark Field, Luzón. Los PW-9 equiparon los 3rd, 6th, y 19th Pursuit Squadrons entre 1925 y 1931.
El FB-1, de los que la Armada estadounidense ordenó 16, pero recibió sólo diez entre el 1 y el 22 de diciembre de 1924,[6]​ no estaba modificado para operaciones navales (por ejemplo, no tenía gancho de apontaje), y fue asignado a los escuadrones del Cuerpo de Marines VF-1M, VF-2M, y VF-3M, siendo desplegados a China en apoyo de la Fuerza Marine Expedicionaria.[7]​ Dos aviones adicionales (designados FB-2) fueron modificados para operar en el portaaviones Langley con la adición del sistema de gancho y tren de aterrizaje de eje dividido. Entraron en servicio con el VF-2 en diciembre de 1925. Los generalmente satisfactorios resultados propiciaron una orden por 27 FB-5, que se convirtieron en los primeros cazas de la Armada destinados específicamente para operaciones embarcadas. Fueron modernizados con motores Packard 2A-1500 de 525 hp, y llevaban una fila de ganchos al final del eje, usados para guiar el avión a través de los cables de la cubierta. Los FB-5 volaron por primera vez el 7 de octubre de 1926, y fueron entregados a la Armada al comienzo del siguiente enero, transportados en barcazas en Puget Sound desde la fábrica de Boeing al Langley, anclado en el puerto de Seattle. Izados a bordo, sus primeros vuelos oficiales fueron realizados desde la cubierta del portaaviones.[8]​

389,"La hipoplasia cerebelosa es un trastorno neurológico que consiste en un subdesarrollo del cerebelo (en la imagen, cerebelo normal señalado en rojo).


== Etiología ==
La hipoplasia cerebelosa puede tener diferentes causas:
Genéticas, debido a una mutación patológica del gen Reelin, que produce una proteína llamada reelina. La reelina es crucial para la regulación de los procesos de migración neuronal y posicionamiento en el desarrollo del cerebro.
Problemas tiroideos.
Accidentes vasculares.
Intoxicaciones.
Infecciones virósicas.


== Síntomas ==
En los niños, la hipoplasia se presenta con retardo madurativo, hipotonía, ataxia, convulsiones, retraso mental y nistagmo.
Al llegar a la adultez, se agregan otros síntomas como vértigo, incapacidad de mantener el equilibrio, dolores de cabeza e hipoacusia.


== Asociaciones con otras patologías ==
La hipoplasia cerebelosa suele presentarse asociada con otros desórdenes, entre los que se incluye el Síndrome de Dandy Walker, el Síndrome de Werdnig-Hoffman y el Síndrome de Walker-Warburg.
La más importante de estas asociaciones es, sin embargo, la de la hipoplasia cerebelosa con la malformación de Chiari del tipo IV. Este trastorno, de descripción reciente, involucra un desarrollo incompleto de las estructuras del cerebelo. Esta forma es rara, y puede involucrar amígdalas muy bajas en el canal espinal, estructuras cerebelosas ausentes, y partes del cráneo y la médula espinal al descubierto.


== Tratamiento ==
No existe tratamiento para curar la hipoplasia del cerebelo. La terapéutica es de apoyo y meramente sintomática. Muchos pacientes requieren terapia de rehabilitación del equilibrio, uno de los principales trastornos de esta patología.


== Pronóstico ==
Esta patología puede tener una naturaleza estática o progresiva. Las formas causadas por malformaciones congénitas no progresan.

La teoría queer rechaza la clasificación de los individuos en categorías universales y fijas, como: varón, mujer, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual o transexual; pues, considera que están sujetas a restricciones impuestas por una cultura en la que la heterosexualidad es obligatoria; así como la heteronormatividad y el heteropatriarcado. Esta teoría sostiene que estas categorías son ficticias y esconden un número enorme de motivaciones políticas apoyadas por la sexología, una ciencia que no ha sido totalmente teorizada.
Contra el concepto clásico de género, que parte de la distinción a partir de la ""heterosexualidad natural"" aceptada como normal (en inglés straight, es decir ""recto""), contraria a lo ""anómalo"" (en inglés queer o ""retorcido""); la teoría queer afirma que todas las ""identidades sexuales"" son igualmente anómalas, incluida la heterosexualidad.[1]​
La teoría queer critica las clasificaciones socio-sexuales de la historiología, psicología, filosofía, antropología y sociología tradicionales, basadas habitualmente en el uso de un solo patrón de segmentación paternalista —sea de clase social, de género, de etnia o de nacionalidad poscolonial— y sostiene que las identidades sociales, condicionadas por la naturaleza sexual, se elaboran de manera más compleja como intersección de múltiples grupos, corrientes y criterios.[2]​
En América Latina han surgido corrientes que han cuestionado la coherencia de los principales referentes de la teoría queer estadounidense y europea, por reproducir una aparente contradicción; pues, mientras cuestionan muchos de los mecanismos normalizadores que dicen combatir, imponen globalmente la expresión inglesa queer para referirse a toda la diversidad sexual, desde una posición elitista y académica, perdiendo todo significado político.[3]​ Además, en el caso del colectivo LGBTI, del que han salido la mayoría de referentes de la teoría queer, históricamente esta comunidad ha tenido una condición marginal o periférica; pero al afirmar que todos las deseos sexuales humanos son igualmente singulares se desmiente esta condición periférica y se invisibiliza la discriminación a la que se enfrentan las personas LGBTI cuando son percibidas como marginales, promoviendo así una institucionalización que es en algunos puntos acorde con el discurso heteronormativo/patriarcal.[4]​
La teoría queer respalda la plasticidad de la naturaleza sexual humana, en la que el sexo no se entiende en términos morales, sino en términos de erotismo, posición jerárquica o responsabilidad social. Sostiene también que el concepto de identidad sexual (hetero/homo/bi/trans) está mistificado; resultando ficticio y limitante, pues las personas son mucho más diversas que las categorías y, en todo caso, lo que debe calificarse es cada acto, fantasía o deseo puntual y no las personas que desean, fantasean o participan.
Más recientemente, nuevos aportes queer surgidos del diálogo Sur-Sur, están proponiendo líneas de reflexión autónomas sobre la misma cuestión.[5]​


== Historia ==


=== Orígenes ===
Con trabajos precursores en la década de 1980 como Between men (Entre hombres) de Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, escrito en 1985, la teoría queer evolucionó a partir del movimiento queer integrado por personas que no se sentían expresadas por la rigidez de categorías como ""homosexual"", ""gay"" y ""lesbiana"", que empezaron a denominarse queers a partir de 1990, resignificando positivamente un término en inglés que se usaba de manera despectiva hacia los diferentes postgénero, traducible como ""raritos"" o ""retorcidos"".
Simultáneamente, en la segunda mitad del siglo XX, venían desarrollándose estudios que profundizaban y cuestionaban nociones tradicionales sobre sexualidad, género y las problemáticas feministas y gais, en especial aquellas relacionadas con el lesbianismo. Muy influyentes para el desarrollo de la teoría queer resultaron los trabajos de Monique Wittig y la Historia de la sexualidad de Michel Foucault.[6]​
La expresión ""teoría queer"" es introducida en 1990 por Teresa de Lauretis,[7]​ y es adoptada rápidamente por otros y otras referentes como Gloria Anzaldúa, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Butler, Michael Warner, José Esteban Muñoz, Beatriz Preciado.


=== Evolución hacia el fenómeno queer: feminismos, lesbianismos ===
Otra diferencia entre los movimientos queer y el movimiento LGBT (Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales y Transexuales) es que aquél no ha tenido precedente en el siglo XIX. Era, pues, necesario para los militantes gais y lesbianas elegir un modelo para su nuevo movimiento. Por una parte, el éxito de los movimientos de los negros norteamericanos les ha resultado atractivo. Por otra, aún cuando los queers están en general más próximos a los gais y lesbianas que a las feministas, muchas de sus raíces ideológicas se encuentran también en el feminismo norteamericano de los años 80. Antes de esa fecha, el feminismo, como otros movimientos similares, esperaba que el progreso social se produciría por un cambio de legislación.
Los argumentos para la aprobación de legislaciones progresistas se han fundado siempre en la comparación entre el grupo minoritario en cuestión y el ciudadano universal, es decir, el hombre rico y blanco. Por motivos diversos, varios movimientos han comenzado, desde los años 70, a oponerse a esta imagen de ciudadano universal, y a valorizar su propia capacidad de actuación o realización. Esta tendencia (marcadamente postmodernista) ha acelerado la ruptura entre el hombre y la mujer y ha solidificado lo que ha venido a constituirse en feminismo. Aparece, sobre todo, en el The Feminine Mystique, de Betty Friedan, creadora de NOW (Organización Nacional para Mujeres), que ha sido sin embargo acusada de ignorar a todas las mujeres que no eran blancas o de una clase social acomodada.
Esta ola de feminismo se situaba, pues, en la noción de diferencia, ya fuera la diferencia entre hombres y mujeres, ya fuera la conceptualización del sujeto y del objeto de varios fenómenos sociales (el discurso, el arte, el matrimonio, etc.). Sin embargo, este movimiento radical de la segunda ola del feminismo ha sido alterado por dos fenómenos ideológicos, ambos relacionados con cuestiones de sexualidad y de género. El primero fue la cuestión de las guerras de sexos (Sex Wars), que dividieron a las teóricas y militantes sobre el papel de la pornografía en la opresión de las mujeres.
La otra fisura se refiere a la presencia de lesbianas en las filas feministas y se conoce como Lavender Menace, nombre de un grupo informal de feministas lesbianas formado para protestar por la exclusión de lesbianas y reivindicaciones lesbianas del movimiento en el Segundo Congreso para la Unidad de las Mujeres, celebrado en mayo de 1970 en Nueva York.
Del mismo modo que los enemigos del feminismo utilizaban (y utilizan) con frecuencia contra sus argumentos la argumentación-acusación de lesbianismo (práctica conocida en inglés como lesbian baiting), una gran parte de las militantes mostraban su propia homofobia y se negaban a aceptar que algunas de ellas eran lesbianas.[cita requerida]
Las lesbianas de la lavender menace manifestaban que ellas eran más feministas gracias a su alejamiento de los hombres, mientras que las feministas heterosexuales aducían que los papeles masculino/femenino (butch/fem) de las parejas lesbianas no eran sino copias del matrimonio heterosexual. Así pues, la homofobia atribuida a la segunda ola, su atención a las práctica sexuales, y sobre todo la división que todo ello produjo, condujo al nacimiento de la teoría queer a comienzo de los años 90.


== Sobre la definición de la teoría ==
La teoría queer parte de la consideración del género como una construcción y no como un hecho natural y establece ante todo la posibilidad de repensar las identidades desde fuera de los cuadros normativos de una sociedad que entiende el hecho sexual como constitutivo de una separación binaria de los seres humanos; dicha separación estaría fundada en la idea de la complementariedad de la pareja heterosexual.


=== El adjetivo queer ===
La teoría queer, con su interés por las implicaciones de sexualidad y género se ha dedicado sobre todo a la exploración de estas implicaciones en téminos de identidad. La naturaleza provisional de la identidad queer implica una amplia discusión sobre la definición del adjetivo queer. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick ha explorado esta dificultad de definición y señalado que, si bien el término cambia su significado según se aplique a uno mismo o a otro, ""tiene la virtud de ofrecer, en el contexto de la investigación académica sobre la identidad de género y la identidad sexual, una novedad que implica etimológicamente un cruce de los límites sin referirse a nada en particular, lo cual deja la cuestión de sus denotaciones abierta a la controversia y la revisión"" (Epistemology of the Closet).


=== La autodesignación de la identidad ===
Gracias a esa naturaleza efímera, la identidad queer, pese a su insistencia sobre la sexualidad y el género, podría aplicarse a todas las personas que alguna vez se han sentido fuera de lugar ante las restricciones de la heterosexualidad y de los papeles de género. Así, si una mujer se interesa en el deporte o un hombre en las labores domésticas, pueden ser calificados como queers. Por este motivo la mayor parte de los teóricos queer insiste en la autodesignación de la identidad. Junto al género, la identidad compone uno de los temas principales de la teoría, y eso incluye la investigación sobre la prostitución, la pornografía, las zonas oscuras de la sexualidad, etc. El vocablo, cuando se aplica a las prácticas sexuales, ofrece muchas más innovaciones que otros términos, como lesbiana o gay.
Cuando alguien se define como queer, es imposible deducir su género. Teresa De Lauretis, que fue la primera en emplear esa palabra para describir su proyecto teórico, esperaba que tuviera aplicaciones iguales para la sexualidad y la raza, la clase y otras categorías. Sin embargo, fuera de los ámbitos universitarios, cuando el término queer se refiere a la sexualidad, es más frecuentemente un sinónimo de gay y lesbiana, a veces de gay, lesbiana y bisexual y con menos frecuencia de gay, lesbiana, bisexual y transexual.


=== La cuestión transexual ===
La exclusión habitual de los transexuales de este uso popular puede deberse al hecho de que un transexual manifiesta unas relaciones desviadas respecto al género y la sexualidad. Muchos transexuales, inspirándose en la teoría queer en los niveles sexual y genérico, prefieren distinguirse de los transexuales tradicionales (los FtM y MtF, siglas inglesas de Female to Male y Male to Female, literalmente Hembra a Macho y Macho a Hembra, expresiones que reafirman el binarismo de género al cambiar de sexo sin otra reivindicación) utilizando las expresiones género queer y FtN o MtN (sustituyendo la segunda parte de la expresión por el adjetivo neutro). Las investigaciones queer sobre el género abarcan sobre todo las opciones desviadas del género (los transgéneros, los género-queer y los travestidos), así como la separación de género y sexo biológico. Partiendo de la afirmación de Simone de Beauvoir ""no se nace mujer, se llega a serlo"", Judith Butler ha sido la primera teórica queer en abordar esta separación entre género y sexo.


=== El miedo de la ciencia y la resistencia ===
La bióloga Anne Fausto-Sterling señala que el miedo a la confusión de los géneros impulsó a la ciencia y la medicina a buscar criterios irrefutables que establecieran el sexo anatómico y el género psicológico. Su trabajo cuestiona las intervenciones médicas que pretenden curar la disforia (malestar, inquietud) de género y el hermafroditismo. Además, la teoría queer se interesa en el parentesco y en las reivindicaciones identitarias en general. Judith Butler ha explorado el parentesco en su libro Antigone's Claim (La reivindicación de Antígona) y la identidad en The Psychic Life of Power (La vida psíquica del poder), en donde se ha propuesto explicar por qué se insiste en una reivindicación identitaria que puede poner a algunas personas en peligro (por provocar una violencia psíquica o física). Casi todos los trabajos que se proclaman queers comparten una resistencia teórica al esencialismo y a las pretensiones totalizadores, lo cual hace a la TQ y al término queer difíciles de describir.


== Grietas en la teoría: universidad y anti-universidad ==
La práctica y el compromiso político desempeñan un papel mucho más importante en el trabajo que se produce fuera de la universidad. Al contrario de las teorías feministas, la teoría queer universitaria se interesa menos por las actitudes militantes, lo cual ha supuesto rupturas. La producción de textos queers no universitarios es abundante. Los zines y los blogs son abundantes en un movimiento que privilegia la auto-afirmación y la importancia de contar la propia historia. Los blogs han multiplicado el acceso de la audiencia transexual a las informaciones (e imágenes) precisas de los que se puede esperar de una transformación quirúrgica. Los textos más influyentes en la población queer desde los años 90 son, no obstante, los que provienen del medio popular.
En Queer Theory, Gender Theory (Teoría Queer, Teoría de Género), Riki Wilchins, transexual, elabora una refutación categórica de la teoría universitaria sobre los queers, señalando que trabaja siempre al estilo bottom-up y que los universitarios han robado la teoría queer a los queers populares. Esta opinión se extiende cada vez más entre los queers, que sienten que en los círculos universitarios se habla de ellos, pero no comprenden lo que se dice. Es posible que esa separación se deba al lenguaje muy elaborado de los teóricos queers universitarios (se acusa a Judith Butler de utilizar una escritura incomprensible), debido, según algunos, a un deseo de compensación de su estatus inferior dentro del mundo académico.
La autobiografía Stone Butch Blues, escrita por Leslie Feinberg, ha sido quizá la primera de un transexual. Este texto, muy influyente, no es solamente el relato del cambio de sexo de una persona: Feinberg muestra toda una ambivalencia hacia las identidades masculinas y femeninas y se mueve siempre en el espacio liminar del género y de la representación. En Trans Warriors, el mismo autor examina las percepciones corporales que se utilizan para determinar el género de una persona, incluidos los vestidos y las estructuras sociales que históricamente han estado abiertas o cerradas a la variación de género.
En un lenguaje muy claro y eficaz, Kate Bornstein utiliza un cuaderno de ejercicios (My Gender Workbook) para ayudar al lector a deconstruir sistemáticamente sus nociones de los papeles masculino y femenino, y ha sido el primer transexual en proponer el establecimiento de una categoría que reivindique la identidad queer o transexual en lugar de la del sexo adoptado.
Pat Califia, escritor y psiquiatra, ha publicado textos diversos, entre ellos novelas pornográficas, de ciencia ficción y una historia de transgéneros. Califia defiende la pornografía en la ciencia ficción, dos géneros criticados con frecuencia, en su opinión, a causa de las posibilidades que ofrecen en tanto que resistentes a la normativa sexual y genérica. Su trabajo Sex changes estudia la historia de los cambios de género a través de la biología, el psicoanálisis, la sociología y la política.


== El papel de la biología ==


=== Categorías biológicas versus construcciones sociales ===
Algunos críticos de la teoría queer sostienen que algunas pruebas fisiológicas, genéticas y sociológicas, muestran que la orientación sexual y la clasificación sexual no pueden ser consideradas construcciones sociales y que varias características biológicas (algunas de las cuales son hereditarias) desempeñan un papel importante en la formación de la conducta sexual. En el presente, no parecen existir pruebas concluyentes en uno u otro sentido, si bien la comunidad científica parece esperar que el estudio del genoma humano y de otras especies aporte más luz al respecto.
Distintos comentaristas responden a estas afirmaciones haciendo ver que no todos los individuos son fácilmente clasificables como hombre o mujer, incluso atendiendo a fundamentos estrictamente biológicos. Por ejemplo, los cromosomas sexuales (X e Y) pueden existir en combinaciones atípicas (como en el síndrome de Klinefelter [XXY]). Esto obstaculiza el uso de los genotipos como medio para definir dos géneros exactamente distintos. Los individuos intersexuados pueden tener características sexuales ambiguas por distintas razones biológicas.
La cuestión de hasta qué punto la identidad sexual y la orientación sexual están fundamentadas en la biología es importante no solo en la teoría queer, sino también, por ejemplo, en sexología.
Actualmente está bien aceptado que en la orientación sexual influyen determinantes ambientales y genéticos, aunque sean solo de carácter correlacional, sin embargo no es posible aún discernir ninguna característica cualitativa o cuantitativa de este determinante genético. Esto pudiera interpretarse a favor de teorías ambientalistas como la TQ, especialmente en referencia a los estudios de antropología donde la sexualidad representa dinámicas sociales de poder al margen de la reproducción.


=== El doctor Money y el caso Reimer ===
En los primeros trabajos de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, el investigador John Money indicó que quedó impresionado por el argumento de que la identidad sexual es una conducta socialmente establecida, y utilizó para probarlo a David Reimer, de pocos meses, quien había sufrido una circuncisión mal practicada. En el experimento se le asignó una identidad femenina y una operación de adecuación de sexo, y bajo el nombre de Brenda fue criado por sus padres bajo esta nueva identidad. El experimento fue un completo fracaso. A los 14 años, después de varios intentos de suicidio, Brenda/David fue informado de todo y decidió realizarse una nueva intervención quirúrgica (esta vez una faloplastía). Finalmente, se suicidó a los 37 años.[8]​[9]​
Este caso ha dado lugar a muchos debates dentro de la teoría queer centrados tanto por su descripción de la reasignación del funcionamiento del género como por su calidad de tratamiento desastroso (y completamente innecesario) de un niño tan sólo porque sus genitales no se acomodaban a la idea ""normal"" de genitales.
En proyectos posteriores, John Money desarrolló importantes matices sobre los casos que conllevan una investigación acerca de la formación de la identidad de género de cualquier persona, aunque no ha vuelto a hablar del caso Reimer tras haberse sabido que durante años no lo había denunciado.


== El porvenir de la teoría ==
Con la crítica de la teoría de la realización propuesta por Butler en Gender Trouble y el apaciguamiento de los grupos provocadores y de drag queens y drag kings, muchos teóricos se encuentran actualmente en un período de búsqueda de nuevos análisis de la resistencia queer
La mayor parte de ese trabajo se produce en ámbitos literarios, psicoanalíticos y lingüísticos, pero también en los dominios de la biología y de las ciencias sociales (incluso si, a causa de la ruptura entre la universidad y los ambientes populares, hay a priori prejuicios hacia los investigadores sociales).
Lee Edelman y otros ponen en relación la teoría queer y el psicoanálisis examinando las nociones lacanianas de construcción identitaria a través de la adquisición del lenguaje y el estadio del espejo. Según ellos, la conciencia de uno mismo procede más de la cultura y del lenguaje que de la biología. En su texto No future, Edelman se apoya también sobre el concepto foucaultiano del Bíopoder para examinar la resistencia de los queers a los sistemas sociales de reproducción (el matrimonio, la producción de niños). Anna Livia ha publicado un trabajo lingüístico (Pronoum Envy) sobre el uso queer del género gramatical en la literatura francesa.
Tras un decenio de elaboración de una teoría crítica, parece que una identidad queer comienza a asentarse. Existen, sin embargo, desacuerdos entre los teóricos que priman el estudio del género y los que se interesan más específicamente en la sexualidad, y entre los universitarios y anti-universitarios. Otra grieta, en fin, aparece entre las comunidades queers y las feministas llamadas de la segunda ola, la cual, con sus rupturas múltiples, ha mantenido sus fieles, aunque algunas reivindican una tercera ola del feminismo, mientras que otras afirman que la teoría queer ha provocado un post-feminismo.


== Personalidades ==
El término ""queer"" aparece en textos teóricos desde por lo menos ""Borderland/La Frontera"" de Gloria Anzaldúa, de 1987. Ya el término ""Teoría Queer"" debe su primer uso a Teresa de Lauretis. Sin embargo, en 1994, ésta criticó la teoría queer estableciendo que no era más que una estrategia de márketing que ""se había convertido rápidamente en un concepto vacío producto de las compañías publicitarias"".
Destacan como influencias históricas de la teoría queer (entre otros): Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, Monique Wittig, Jonathan Katz, Ester Newton, Andy Warhol, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, John Money, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida. Pero los primeros que desarrollaron la teoría fueron Gayle Rubin, Kaja Silverman, D.A. Miller, Sue-Ellen Case, Douglas Crimp, John D'Emilio, Lee Edelman, Michel Foucault, Joan Scott, Simon Watney, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Leo Bersani, David Halperin, Michael Moon, Michael Warner, Donna Haraway y muchos otros.


== Activismo y teoría ==
Se puede decir que hay dos vertientes de la teoría queer: el ámbito teórico y el activista, con grupos como ACT UP o Queer Nation. La influencia que ha tenido esta teoría en el mundo académico estadounidense es grande. En España se conocieron grupos como LSD o la Radikal Gai en los años noventa. Con la llegada del nuevo milenio surgen prácticas políticas que superan la política institucional de los grupos LGTB, el FAGC [1] (Front d'Alliberament Gai de Catalunya ['Frente de Liberación Gay de Cataluña']), EHGAM (Euskal Herriko Gay-les Askapenerako Mugimendua ['Movimiento de Liberación de Gays y Lesbianas de Euskal Herria']), Maribolheras Precarias (Galicia), Queer Ekintza (Euskadi), El grupo QK [2] (Alacant), y Liberacción (Madrid) forman parte de la red contra la homofobia, y sus luchas van más allá de una reivindicación exclusiva para la comunidad LGTB cada vez más mercantilizada; la lucha contra la precariedad o la guerra forman parte de su ideario político, todo ello a través de la reivindicación festiva, buscando espacios autónomos donde poder reinventar la vida. La teoría queer comienza a abrirse paso también en el ámbito académico.


== Movimiento queer en España ==
En la España de principios de los 1990 ocurre lo mismo que había pasado con el término anglosajón queer, ciertos grupos como Lesbianas Sin Duda (LSD) o la Radical Gai adoptan palabras como bollera o maricón, anteriormente sólo despectivas, para autodefinirse y para crear una militancia diferente que no se dirige al Estado pidiendo subvenciones, leyes o regulaciones, sino que trabaja en otras líneas políticas independientes y reacias a la buena imagen y a la integración en el sistema heterosexual dominante.
El movimiento no ha dejado de trabajar y extenderse dando origen a comienzos de este siglo diversos grupos queer, principalmente de lesbianas, organizan los primeros talleres drag king, producen porno alternativo, documentales, libros, festivales de cine, performances, conferencias etc. Existen debates y alianzas respecto a diversas realidades políticas: la regulación del trabajo sexual, la posibilidad de otra pornografía, un nuevo feminismo no lesbófobo y no transfóbico, la inmigración, el acceso libre a hormonas, despenalización de las drogas, el heterocentrismo en escuelas y medios de comunicación, cómo se construyen el sexo y el género, las problemáticas de la prevención del sida, etc. Grupos como Mambo , Girlswholikeporno, Grupo de Trabajo Queer-GTQ, Zona de Intensitat, Medeak, Post Op, O.R.G.I.A, Corpus Delicti, Maribolheras precarias o la revista Parole de queer, entre otros, ejercen actualmente diversas militancias queer en diferentes zonas de España y han creado vínculos con otros grupos en Europa y América Latina.
También en el ámbito de la cultura y el arte ha habido una amplia producción cultural feminista y queer desde los años 80, que continúa en la actualidad con numerosas exposiciones y seminarios sobre artistas y culturas queer. La universidad: desde hace unos años existen en diversas universidades españolas seminarios, cursos de postgrado, tesis doctorales y conferencias sobre las culturas queer. El filósofo y activista gay Paco Vidarte, profesor de la Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia organizó entre 2003 y 2005 dos ediciones de un curso de teoría queer, y en otras universidades de España se pueden encontrar recientes ejemplos de programas y cursos sobre estas culturas. Paralelamente desde finales de los 90 se vienen publicando en España libros sobre prácticas, militancias y teorías queer, traducciones, así como numerosos blogs, webs, y foros, para el intercambio de información y la creación de proyectos comunes.
Además de Paco Vidarte, en España han contribuido a la teoría queer investigadores/as como Fefa Vila, Silvia García Dauder, Carmen Romero Bachiller, Raquel Platero, Elvira Burgos, Gracia Trujillo, Gerard Coll-Planas, Miquel Missé, Rafael Mérida Jiménez, Beatriz Preciado, Sejo Carrascosa, Ricardo Llamas, Eduardo Nabal, Pablo Pérez Navarro y Javier Sáez del Álamo.

392,"Serafín Húder Lasala médico y político navarro (España). Pamplona 29-07-1874 / 25-03-19621962.
Forma parte de una importante saga familiar de médicos y políticos republicanos navarros.
Nace en la calle Carnicerías de Pamplona, pegada en el siglo XIX al Ayuntamiento de Pamplona, y hoy derribada para ensanchar la plaza del mercado nuevo. Nace recién acabada la I República española, el 2 de enero de 1874, durante la Regencia de Serrano y mientras Cánovas del Castillo prepara la vuelta de los Borbones en la figura de Alfonso XII de España. Todavía en septiembre los Carlistas sitian Pamplona hasta febrero del 75. Serafín tenía meses pero siempre contaba el horror con que se recordaban aquellos días.
Su padre, Francisco Húder San Román, político republicano, fue brevemente Alcalde de Pamplona y Diputado en Congreso de los Diputados de España durante la I República, cuya llegada celebró y presidió en Pamplona, desde el balcón del Ayuntamiento. En 1883, su padre se casa con Lorenza Susperregui, a su vez, viuda de Nicolás Aztarain, Para Serafín, su madrastra, fue tan querida como una madre, según sus propios comentarios, sobre todo cuando en 1888 muere también su padre. Lorenza sigue regentando el comercio familiar y sacando adelante los cuatro hijastros huérfanos. Cambiaron de casa a la Calle Mayor, 7, enfrente del Condestable.
Estudió, igual que sus hermanos, en el colegio Huarte de Pamplona, en la Calle Mayor, siendo compañeros de los Pío Baroja y sus hermanos y posteriormente en el Instituto de 2ª Enseñanza (actualmente sede del INAP). Acaba el bachiller en el curso 1890-91. Era un buen estudiante. Se va a Madrid a estudiar medicina. Su hermano Joaquín Húder, estudió Derecho, Vicente Húder, también médico, estudió en Zaragoza y Gregorio Húder, Derecho en Madrid.
Es un enamorado de la música clásica y aprovechaba Madrid para ir a la opera. Pero también tenía afición por los Sanfermines y compuso una letrilla para la música del riau-riau. Al acabar la carrera, 22 años trabajó en la Beneficencia de Madrid y preparó su tesis doctoral sobre el Tracoma. La presentó en julio de 1899 con 25 años.
Vuelve a Navarra. En 1899 fue nombrado médico de Echalar y traspasada la plaza a su hermano Vicente. En 1901 y 1902 de Biurrun, Campanas y Tiebas. En 1903 se traslada a Pamplona. Consigue su plaza de medico con 27 años.Fue médico de la Beneficencia municipal de Pamplona. Su principal dedicación fue atender las familias “sin medios”, vacunación gratuita asimilada a la Misericordia y reconocimiento de quintos. La miseria y suciedad que vio en esas casas luego la reflejó en sus estudios sobre higiene de las viviendas y personas de Pamplona que tanto le preocupaba que incluso le llegó a obsesionar. Tantos años en ese trabajo (1902-1937) le habían dada fama de buena persona y médico entregado por lo que al llegar la guerra le apodaban “el Santo”
También le correspondía atender la enfermería de la Plaza de Toros de Pamplona. Cuando llegó, encontró un “botiquín cochambroso” no preparado para un acontecimiento tan importante como los encierros de los Sanfermines. Hay fotos y un artículo escrito por él en 1940 cuyo título “Un encierro emocionante y trascendental 1902” se llegó a publicar en 1976. Merece la pena leerlo. Es un artículo interesante escrito en aquella época.
En 1908 se casó con Manuela Domezáin. Tuvieron dos hijos Mª Jesús (1909) y Javier (1911), a los que educaron de una forma bastante liberal para la época. Los dos fueron a la Universidad. Las Ursulinas donde iba Mª Jesús no aceptaron que quisiera preparar el ingreso, pero su padre se empeñó y lo hizo. Esperó un año para ir con su hermano. Los dos estudiaran Bachiller en el Instituto y luego Mª Jesús Filosofía y Letras en Zaragoza, y Javier Medicina en Madrid.
En 1907 presentó un plan al Ayuntamiento de Pamplona para mejorar las condiciones higiénicas de las viviendas. Era consciente de que el casco viejo tenía muchas limitaciones y proponía la apertura de Pamplona hacia Barañain para aprovechar el aire y sol. Por eso cuando se hizo el ensanche fue de los primeros que se fue a la calle Arrieta.
En 1913 asistió a un Congreso en San Sebastián sobre la Tuberculosis y vino bastante entusiasmado de cómo se hacían las cosas en San Sebastián. Recomienda al Ayuntamiento depurar las aguas residuales, traer la instalación de la gota de leche y hacer un sanatorio de Tuberculosis. Daba conferencias, sobre desinfección a maestras y cura de heridas a obreros. Le preocupaba mucho la higiene de la ciudad y consiguió que se creara el Negociado de Sanidad e Higiene. Desde allí dio alguna charla sobre la Mortalidad en Pamplona desde 1870. Creó las colonias infantiles en Pedrosa para niñas pobres de la Beneficencia.
Cuando llegó la dictadura de Miguel Primo de Rivera, (1923-1930), por ser republicano, fue apartado del servicio y relegado. A nivel de política, aunque apenas convivió con su padre, está claro que heredó sus ideas, o quizás a través de sus hermanos mayores que también participaron en política como republicanos progresistas. José Joaquín fue concejal por la candidatura Liberal-Republicana.
En 1931 fue presidente del Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro, partido creado en 1914 por su hermano Gregorio Huder, reorganizando el partido y pasando a ser el de mayor crecimiento en Navarra en 1931.Se relacionó con los dirigentes de los demás partidos con intención de unirse. Creía que había demasiados partidos para tan pocos republicanos. En 1931 una vez instaurada la república abandonó la militancia. Serafín recibió cartas de políticos de entonces: Miguel Maura, Lerroux y. también de Alcalá Zamora con quien tenía unas buenas relaciones personales.
Proclamó la República en Pamplona, desde el ayuntamiento, el mismo 14 de abril a las siete de la tarde. Este hecho congregó un gran entusiasmo en la ciudad a pesar de la victoria de los partidos de derechas y antirrepublicanos en Navarra. Él mismo recordaba que su padre había proclamado la Primera República en 1873.Tiene dos artículos sobre ese día: uno, titulado “Admirable” donde describe el buen ambiente, pacifico de ese día. Otro, publicado con ocasión del primer aniversario y publicado en el periódico Democracia. Cuenta la emoción que le produjo hacer lo mismo que su padre había hecho 58 años antes.
A pesar del papel tan importante que tuvo hasta 1931, durante la República, no ocupó ningún cargo en las nuevas instituciones. ¿Motivo? Su nombre estuvo en las listas para gobiernos civiles pero no fue nombrado ni concejal ni diputado, ni presidente. Tenía 58 años y no quiso tener un cargo político remunerado ya que su profesión era médica. La política solo era un medio de cambiar las diferencias sociales y el republicanismo una búsqueda de la Democracia que existía en Europa pero no en España. Colaboró con el periódico Democracia que solo duró un año y es donde se publicó el artículo. En 1935 publicó un estudio de Demografía en Pamplona 1835-1935.
Al llegar la guerra, aunque en Navarra no hubo frente, hubo encarcelados, represaliados y fusilados, entre ellos los dos hijos de sus hermanos, y gente que tuvo que escapar, exiliarse. El corrió peligro en varias ocasiones, pero sobrevivió. De todas formas, lo paso muy mal, miedo por él, sus familiares y amigos y .por lo que le tocó ver. El mismo lo cuenta en sus memorias a las que dedicó su tiempo después de la guerra.
Fue destituido de su plaza de médico de la Beneficencia municipal iniciada la Guerra Civil, cuando en Navarra, que ganaron los sublevados, aplicaron las destituciones a los funcionarios. (véase Víctimas de la Guerra Civil en Navarra)
En el año 37, por la Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas se le abre expediente y es destituido como funcionario. Es desposeído de su pensión legal a la que recurre y embargado su coche y un local. Su familia política Domezáin de Artajona, Javier Domezáin Chavarri, con un mayor patrimonio, pagó también por la citada ley una multa en 1940, finalmente de 300.000 pts, después de ser aceptado en parte el recurso legal interpuesto. Ahí ya no le valió su buena fama. Le tocó soportar la derrota republicana y recibir el juicio de la gente de Pamplona, considerados hasta antes de la guerra como amigos. A partir de 1940 tuvo que dejar de practicar la medicina y se dedicó a escribir sus memorias que se conservan actualmente.
Murió el 25 de abril de 1962 con 87 años. En 1969 el Ayuntamiento le dedicó una calle, junto a otros médicos, en San Jorge. Los que le conocieron, amigos y adversarios, coinciden en que estaba metido en política por convicción sin ninguna ambición y ser una víctima de las circunstancias políticas que le tocó vivir y que como persona representaba el personaje poemizado de Antonio Machado ""bueno en el buen sentido de la palabra bueno"".

Las crónicas contemporáneas mencionan a Lindisfarena,[3]​ que en inglés antiguo significa ""isla de los que viajan desde Lindsey"",[4]​ un indicativo que la isla fue ocupada por habitantes del reino de Lindsey, o posiblemente que sus habitantes viajasen hasta allí.

El monasterio fue fundado a principios del siglo VII por San Aidan, un monje irlandés al que el rey Oswaldo de Bernicia encargó evangelizar las inhóspitas regiones del Norte de Inglaterra. Con el tiempo se convertiría en un importante núcleo de cultura: De su escritorio salieron grandes obras, como los Evangelios de Lindisfarne, copia en latín de los textos sagrados, y al que en el siglo X se añadieron comentarios en inglés antiguo, lo que los convierte en los más antiguos textos bíblicos en lengua inglesa.

400,"Laurent Kudu Gbagbo (pronunciación [loʁɑ̃ kudu ɡ͡baɡ͡bo]) (Gagnoa, 31 de mayo de 1945) es historiador, político y expresidente de Costa de Marfil. Perteneciente a la etnia bété (familia lingüística kru), cursó estudios de Historia en Costa de Marfil y Francia y se dedicó a la enseñanza.


== Biografía ==
Desde sus inicios luchó por la democracia y el multipartidismo, luchas que le valieron la cárcel y el exilio. El 31 de marzo de 1971 fue arrestado por su activismo político de oposición al partido único de la época, en el gobierno desde la independencia. Su encarcelamiento duró dos años.
Desde 1980 ha adoptado fuertes posiciones nacionalistas que le han valido el decidido apoyo de la población mayoritariamente cristiana del sur del país. En secreto, estableció las bases de un partido socialista. Al descubrir el gobierno la existencia de este partido, se exilió en Francia, entre 1980 y 1988. Después de su regreso, en 1990 fue candidato a la presidencia y, posteriormente, fue elegido miembro de la Asamblea Nacional, donde combatió las tendencias autoritarias del gobierno del presidente Félix Houphouët-Boigny.
En octubre de 2000 ganó las primeras elecciones democráticas celebradas en Costa de Marfil y fue proclamado presidente, luego de una rebelión civil que depuso al gobierno militar instaurado desde 2000.
Los opositores a su gobierno, encabezados por Alassane Dramane Ouattara, quien no pudo ser candidato al no demostrar su nacionalidad marfileña según los criterios instaurados por el general Guéï (autor del golpe de estado de 1999 y respaldado por Ouattara), hicieron un llamamiento a nuevas elecciones. En septiembre de 2002, un motín en una guarnición degeneró en guerra civil, ocasionando la intervención de una fuerza de interposición por parte de Francia, así como de la ONU, que separó los dos bandos y logró una tregua en 2003 que duró hasta septiembre de 2004.
Laurent Gbagbo inició los Acuerdos de Uagadugú, con el respaldo del presidente de Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaoré, y unos acuerdos únicamente interafricanos sin injerencia externa. En estos acuerdos incluyó a Guillaume Soro, jefe de los rebeldes, como Primer Ministro, dejando así sin liderazgo la rebelión y a sus aliados políticos como Alassane Ouattara. Al inicio de reformas y nuevas elecciones, el gobierno del presidente Gbagbo antepuso la rendición de las tropas rebeldes. En diciembre de 2010, el Consejo constitucional le declara vencedor de la elección presidencial. Recibe el apoyo del general Philippe Mangou, comandante del ejército y presta juramento el 4 de diciembre de 2010, el mismo día que su adversario, Alassane Ouattara, es declarado vencedor de las elecciones por la Comisión electoral independiente. Casi la totalidad de la comunidad internacional reconoce la victoria de Alassane Ouattara. En ese momento, las fuerzas de ambos presidentes iniciaron una guerra civil, en la que la comunidad internacional impuso a Gbagbo sanciones económicas e intervino (sobre todo tropas francesas) en las fases finales del enfrentamiento.
El 11 de abril de 2011, Laurent Gbagbo, fue detenido, junto a su esposa, en el búnker en el que se escondía desde hacía varios días, por las fuerzas del electo Alassane Ouattara, según fuentes del ministerio de Defensa galo. Fuentes de la ONU en Nueva York han asegurado que Gbagbo se encuentra bien de salud y que será juzgado. El funcionario dijo que la misión de la ONU, conocida como UNOCI, estaba ""brindando protección y seguridad de acuerdo con su mandato"". UNOCI tiene un mandato para proteger a los actores políticos de Costa de Marfil, entre ellos a Gbagbo.
El 30 de noviembre de 2011, Laurent Gbagbo fue extraditado de su país a los Países Bajos para ser juzgado por la Corte Penal Internacional por presuntos crímenes de lesa humanidad; se trata del primer ex-jefe de estado que será juzgado por la CPI desde la creación de este tribunal internacional.[1]​
El 5 de diciembre de 2011 Gbagbo comparece por primera vez ante la Corte Penal Internacional para responder por crímenes de lesa humanidad, en un hito histórico al ser el primer ex-jefe de estado que comparece en audiencia judicial como acusado ante esa corte; Gbagbo se queja de maltratos a él y su familia por militares franceses durante su captura y cautiverio en Costa de Marfil.[2]​
El 12 de julio de 2013 la Corte Penal Internacional decidió seguir manteniendo en prisión preventiva a la espera de juicio a Gbagbo al rechazar un recurso judicial presentado por los abogados defensores del ex-presidente.[3]​
El 28 de enero de 2016 comenzó el juicio oral y público de Gbagbo ante la Corte Penal Internacional; en el juicio se le acusa de ordenar una ola de represión contra sus opositores y la población civil con el propósito de mantenerse en el poder, una represión en la que fueron asesinadas al menos 3.000 personas y otras muchas sufrieron en su integridad física y emocional. En concreto se le acusa de delitos de asesinato, violación, persecución y otros actos inhumanos; se señala que la persecución que promovió aparte de propósitos políticos también tuvo ""motivos religiosos, étnicos y xenófobos"". Gbagbo rechaza los cargos y proclama su inocencia.[4]​[5]​

405,"El Movimiento 26 de Julio (M-26-7) fue una organización política y militar cubana creada informalmente en 1953 por un grupo liderado por Fidel Castro que atacó los cuarteles del ejército en Santiago de Cuba con el fin de derrocar al dictador Fulgencio Batista. Tenía una ideología nacionalista, antiimperialista y democrática fundada en las ideas de José Martí.
Fue la organización más importante entre las que participaron de la Revolución cubana. A fines de 1956 estableció una base guerrillera en la Sierra Maestra que terminó venciendo a las tropas del dictador Fulgencio Batista el 31 de diciembre de 1958, para tomar el poder e instalar junto con otras organizaciones un gobierno presidido por Manuel Urrutia Lleó.
En julio de 1961 fue uno de los partidos que integraron las Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas (ORI), junto con el Partido Socialista Popular y el Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo que a su vez se disuelve el 26 de marzo de 1962 para formar el Partido Unido de la Revolución Socialista de Cuba (PURSC), de ideología comunista.


== Origen ==
Su nombre proviene del asalto al Cuartel Moncada en Santiago de Cuba el 26 de julio de 1953. El M-26-7 fue creado en Cuba el 12 de junio de 1955 en la clandestinidad, durante la dictadura de Fulgencio Batista (1952-1959).
Por entonces Fidel Castro, su promotor, acababa de ser amnistiado y liberado de la cárcel donde se encontraba cumpliendo una condena por haber encabezado el asalto al Cuartel Moncada en 1953. Debido a esa acción, Fidel Castro, quien era un importante líder del Partido Ortodoxo fundado por Eduardo Chibás, se volvió una personalidad célebre en la isla.
El núcleo inicial, formado por el grupo que organizó el asalto al Cuartel Moncada, se fusionó con el Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario que dirigía Rafael García Bárcenas y con la mayor parte de la Juventud Ortodoxa. Poco después se uniría Acción Nacional Revolucionaria dirigido por Frank País. Debido a la amplitud ideológica y a su objetivo de derrocar la tiranía de Batista, el M-26-7 iría rápidamente sumando a jóvenes de las más diversas procedencias políticas.


== Acción política y militar ==

Durante 1955 y 1956 el M-26-7 se dedica a organizarse en todo el país mediante direcciones provinciales y territoriales, mientras que, una parte de la Dirección Nacional, incluyendo a Fidel Castro, debió exiliarse a México, donde organizaron y entrenaron a un núcleo guerrillero con el fin de desembarcar en Cuba e iniciar una revolución armada.
En 1956 un grupo de 82 guerrilleros del Movimiento 26 de Julio, conducidos por Fidel Castro, se embarcaron en México en el yate Granma para desembarcar en la Playa de las Coloradas, en el Oriente cubano. Tras un mal comienzo y gran número de bajas, un pequeño grupo de aproximadamente 12 personas,[1]​ el Ejército Rebelde, logró instalar una base guerrillera en la Sierra Maestra, aumentando sus filas a 400 hombres en febrero de 1958.[2]​ En comparación las fuerzas de Batista alcanzaban los 50.000 hombres, pero solamente 10.000 pudieron ser empleados a la vez para enfrentar a la guerrilla.[3]​ Para enfrentarlos las tropas de Fulgencio Batista lanzaron una ofensiva de 10.000 con apoyo aéreo y terrestre para cercar y destruir a los guerrilleros ocultos en la Sierra entre abril y agosto de 1958, esta campaña terminó en un fracaso decisivo para el desarrollo del conflicto.[4]​ Finalmente después de dos años de guerra los rebeldes vencieron a las fuerzas de Batista provocando su huida a República Dominicana y la toma del poder el 1 de enero de 1959. Para ese momento sumaban de 2.000[1]​a 3.000[2]​guerrilleros y la guerra había costado la vida de entre mil y dos mil quinientas personas.[1]​
Durante el período de la guerra, en el M-26-7 surgieron dos grupos claramente definidos, y denominados con los términos de «la sierra» y «el llano», refiriéndose el primero al grupo guerrillero, directamente dirigido por Fidel Castro con gran influencia del Che Guevara y Raúl Castro, y el segundo a los dirigentes que se encontraban en las ciudades realizando tareas de agitación y relación con otros partidos políticos, los sindicatos y el movimiento estudiantil. Desde un comienzo el grupo de «la sierra» adoptó una posición más izquierdista, antinorteamericana y con mejores relaciones con el Partido Comunista, que el grupo de «el llano», que mostraba una posición nacionalista-antiimperialista clásica, con un fuerte contenido anticomunista, más inclinada a establecer una democracia liberal. En el grupo de «el llano» se destacaron dirigentes como Armando Hart y René Ramos Latour.
Después de la toma del poder, Fidel Castro, el Che Guevara y Raúl Castro influyeron fuertemente para que el M-26-7 se identificara con los principios del comunismo provocando fracturas internas y alejamientos. Por esta razón algunos de sus integrantes se volvieron claramente contrarios a la revolución, como Huber Matos, más inclinados a establecer un gobierno nacionalista alejado de las transformaciones sociales, que fue condenado a prisión y exilio, o Pedro Boitel encarcelado hasta su muerte en 1972. Otros se exiliaron como Raúl Chibás y José Pardo Llada. Manuel Artime participó en la fracasada Invasión de Bahía de Cochinos.
La evolución hacia el comunismo del M-26-7 y del gobierno cubano llevó a la progresiva disolución del Movimiento 26 de Julio. En julio de 1961 se integró a las Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas (ORI), junto con el Partido Socialista Popular (Comunista) y el Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo. Las ORI a su vez, se disolvieron el 26 de marzo de 1962 para formar el Partido Unido de la Revolución Socialista de Cuba (PURSC), de ideología comunista. Este último, finalmente, el 3 de octubre de 1965 se transformó en el Partido Comunista de Cuba.


== Himno ==
El himno del 26 de Julio o el Himno de la libertad, es compuesto por Agustín Díaz Cartaya a finales de 1953, durante los hechos posteriores del asalto de Cuartel Moncada, y la música es dirigida posteriormente por Carlos Faxas en 1957. Este himno está dedicado a los asaltantes que murieron en dicho asalto, y un canto de combate a favor de la libertad del pueblo Cuba y que se transformó en marcha oficial del M-26-7, que entonó por primera vez en las emisiones de Radio Rebelde en 1958. A partir del triunfo de la revolución cubana en 1959, se convirtió en marcha oficial, tanto en actos conmemorativos como militares, políticos, educativos y culturales.

406,"La Estación Aérea del Cuerpo de Marines de Miramar (en inglés, 'Marine Corps Air Station Miramar', abreviada MCAS Miramar) (código IATA: NKX, código OACI: KNKX, FAA LID: NKX), anteriormente llamada Estación Aeronaval de Miramar (Naval Air Station Miramar o NAS Miramar), son unas instalaciones del Cuerpo de Marines de los Estados Unidos y base de la 3ª Ala de Aeronaves de los Marines, que es el elemento de aviación de la I Fuerza Expedicionaria de Marines. Está situada 16 km al norte del centro de San Diego, California, Estados Unidos.
El aeródromo se llama Mitscher Field en honor del almirante Marc Mitscher un comandante de la Fast Carrier Task Force durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. El aeródromo es la antigua ubicación de la Flota del Pacífico de combate y de la Alerta temprana y control aerotransportado de aeronaves (F-4 Phantom II, F-14 Tomcat, E-2 Hawkeye) y mejor conocida como la antigua ubicación del United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS), y su programa de capacitación TOPGUN y la película del mismo nombre. En 1996, la NFWS se trasladó a la Naval Air Station Fallon en el oeste de Nevada y se fusionó con la Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC). Durante el apogeo de TOPGUN en Miramar NAS, la estación fue apodada ""Fightertown USA. "".

La base tiene un área de 23,116 acres. Está rodeada por Kearny Villa Road y la Interestatal 15. El área al este de Kearny Villa Road, llamada ""East Miramar"", está poco desarrollada y es utilizada para el entrenamiento militar.


== Historia ==
Los amerindios fueron los primeros habitantes de la base. España reclamó el área en los 1500s. La corona emitió un otorgamiento de tierras a Don Santiago Arguello. Después de la Guerra Civil Americana, las tierras fueron divididas y vendidas a personas como a Edward Scripps, editor de un periódico del este de Estados Unidos. La tierra se utilizaba principalmente para el pastoreo y la agricultura en el año 1900.

407,"Natalia Morar (en ruso: Наталья Григорьевна Морарь; *12 de enero de 1984) es una socióloga y periodista moldava. En dos ocasiones fue expulsada de Rusia por sacar a la luz tramas de corrupción protagonizadas por altos cargos del Kremlin. En abril de 2009, tuvo activa participación en la organización de las protestas de Moldavia.


== Primera expulsión de Rusia ==
En 2002 Natalia Norar se trasladó a Rusia con la finalidad de estudiar sociología en la Universidad Estatal de Moscú. Cinco años después, mientras trabajaba como investigadora en la revista rusa “New Times”, solicitó también la ciudadanía rusa. Sin embargo, este derecho nunca se le otorgó.
En diciembre de 2007, apenas cuatro meses antes de la fecha marcada para la concesión de la ciudadanía, Morar fue expulsada de Rusia. Las autoridades del país decidieron denegarle el permiso de residencia tras la publicación de “El dinero negro del Kremlin”, un artículo en el que explicaba la financiación ilegal de los principales partidos políticos dependientes del gobierno.
Partiendo de una pequeña operación de blanqueo de dinero, Natalia Morar inició su investigación sobre la corrupción de los altos funcionarios del Kremlin en mayo de 2007. A partir de ahí fue sacando a la luz operación de mayor entidad protagonizada, entre otros, por Bortnikov Alexander, jefe adjunto del FSB, que operaba a través del Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG. A su vez, en ese mismo artículo, Morar acusaba a los servicios secretos rusos de estar detrás del asesinato del opositor Andrei Kozlov.
La expulsión del país y el rechazo a otorgarle la ciudadanía rusa se basó, según fuentes gubernamentales, en una ley que negaba ese derecho a las personas consideradas peligrosas para la seguridad del estado


== Intentos por volver a Rusia ==
Con la publicación del artículo y la posterior expulsión de Natalia Morar, el servicio de Seguridad Federal Ruso abortó todos los intentos de esta por regresar al país. En febrero de 2008 concertó un matrimonio con un periodista autóctono y así poder regresar a Rusia. Sin embargo, este intento tampoco dio resultado. Las autoridades rusas dieron orden de que no se le dejara salir del aeropuerto. De esta manera, tras pasar tres días en la zona de tránsito, tuvo que regresar a Chisinau.
Un mes después, Morar anunciaba que presentaría una queja al Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos. Según la periodista moldava, varios de los derechos humanos de la Convención Europea no habían sido respetados en su caso. En concreto, denunciaba el hecho de que una familia permanecía separada por voluntad del Kremlin.


== La protesta moldava ==
El 6 de abril de 2009, Morar participó en la organización de la concentración frente al Parlamento de Moldavia. Los manifestantes protestaban por la manipulación llevada a cabo por el Partido Comunista en las elecciones legislativas de ese año.
Mediante el uso de las redes sociales, en especial por Twitter, apenas trescientas personas lograron congregar a diez mil frente a la sede de la asamblea moldava. Entre ellos estaban algunos de los principales líderes de los partidos de la oposición.
El cariz violento tomado por la protesta el 7 de abril hizo que Morar se desvinculara del movimiento. En un post de su blog aclaraba que ella había organizado una protesta pacífica y que, por tanto, no se sentía responsable de los actos violentos que estaban teniendo lugar. En los días siguientes instó a los manifestantes a abandonar las prácticas violentas.
Esas declaraciones no evitaron que, el 9 de abril, fuera acusada por las autoridades de la organización y puesta en marcha de los disturbios. Como medida inmediata, fue puesta bajo arresto domiciliario.
En noviembre tuvo lugar el juicio contra los organizadores de la protesta de abril, entre los que, además de Morar, se encontraba Gabriel Stati, hijo del empresario más rico del país. La fiscalía les acusaba de utilizar sitios web y redes sociales para organizar protestas callejeras violentas en Chisinau.
Al fin, el fiscal general Valeriu Zubco retiró los cargos contra Morar y los restantes acusados.

408,"Suspensión de la incredulidad es una expresión que representa la voluntad de un sujeto para dejar de lado (suspender) su sentido crítico, ignorando incoherencias o incompatibilidades de la obra de ficción en la que se encuentra inmerso (como por ejemplo la existencia del unicornio), permitiéndole adentrarse y disfrutar del mundo de ficción expuesto en la obra. El término se ha aplicado tradicionalmente a la literatura, al cine, la televisión y al teatro, pero también se aplica al ámbito de los videojuegos o de los juegos de rol, así como en el ilusionismo.
Es usual (al menos en inglés) encontrar la expresión escrita en su forma completa, «suspensión voluntaria de la incredulidad» (willing suspension of disbelief). Sin embargo, el término «voluntaria» resulta redundante, por lo que suele omitirse.


== Historia ==
La expresión fue acuñada en 1817 por el poeta inglés Samuel Taylor Coleridge en el fragmento siguiente:

Esta idea dio origen al proyecto de Lyrical Ballads; en el cual se acordó que debería centrar mi trabajo en personas y personajes sobrenaturales, o al menos novelescos, transfiriendo no obstante a estas sombras de la imaginación, desde nuestra naturaleza interior, el suficiente interés humano como para lograr momentanáneamente la voluntaria suspensión de la incredulidad que constituye la fe poética. (Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria)


== Ejemplos en la literatura y el teatro ==
En realidad, el concepto deriva del concepto de verosimilitud inserto en la Poética de Aristóteles, que postula la idea retórica de que, para convencer, es preferible una mentira creíble a una verdad increíble. En consecuencia, el escritor debe esforzarse por hacer realista lo irreal, como hizo Miguel de Cervantes al escribir una novela realista parodiando los libros de caballerías.
La suspensión de la incredulidad es un componente esencial del teatro en vivo, como demostró William Shakespeare en sus obras. De esta forma, los espectadores aceptan limitaciones en la historia que se les presenta, sacrificando realismo y, en ocasiones, lógica y credibilidad, por mor de la diversión.
J. R. R. Tolkien, por el contrario, desafió este concepto en su ensayo Sobre los cuentos de hadas (On Fairy Stories), eligiendo en su lugar el paradigma de la subcreación.


== Ejemplos en el ilusionismo ==
En el ilusionismo, el mago español Arturo de Ascanio acuñó el término ""Atmósfera Mágica"" para referirse al ambiente de magia, sorpresa y misterio que el mago consigue cuando ejecuta sus efectos de modo que el público no pueda, no ya ver sino ni siquiera sospechar o barruntar la causa secreta que los produce. El público no sospecha, incluso, la mera existencia de esa causa, y la serie de efectos le cogen siempre totalmente desprevenido. Es decir, la atmósfera mágica se da cuando, en una secuencia de juegos o efectos, todo sucede como si la magia auténtica (posibilidad de hacer milagros) existiera realmente. Los juegos, las sorpresas, se desarrollan de un modo tan natural y tan inesperado, las manipulaciones o medios secretos aparecen tan absolutamente insospechables, que los efectos producidos son realmente alucinantes. En palabras del propio Ascanio: «Concebida así, la atmósfera mágica es el summum de perfección a que puede aspirar todo mago.» Tal vez, ese término propio del arte de la magia pueda ser la aplicación directa de la supresión de la incredulidad que se da en otras artes escénicas y del tiempo como son la literatura, el cine y el teatro.


== Ejemplos en los videojuegos ==
En los videojuegos, crear la ""suspensión de la incredulidad"" es una parte importante, debido a que jugar un videojuego es una experiencia de inmersión [cita requerida]. Es un término que se utiliza para referirse a la acción de ignorar ciertas incoherencias en el juego para entrar en el ambiente necesario que ayuda al jugador a sentirse envuelto dentro de otro mundo. Muchas veces, el término se confunde con otra expresión llamada ""círculo mágico"", pero hay que recalcar que no es lo mismo. Aunque si tienen relación entre ellas, debido a que sin una suspensión de la incredulidad resulta imposible entrar en un círculo mágico, haciendo de la inmersión del jugador en el juego imposible.


== Cuarta pared ==
La cuarta pared es la división imaginaria entre los personajes de la obra y los espectadores. Es un componente tradicional del teatro y el cine, que ayuda a mantener la suspensión de la incredulidad. Sin embargo, en otras expresiones artísticas la suspensión de la incredulidad se mantiene aún cuando no existe cuarta pared.
Ejemplos de ello son el ilusionismo y la comedia en vivo, en la que los intérpretes interactúan abiertamente con el público, aún cuando sus representaciones son ficticias.
Asimismo, en la lucha libre profesional los luchadores y periodistas interactúan con los espectadores, ganándose el aplauso o haciéndose abuchear. En cambio, la suspensión de la incredulidad se mantiene mediante la ilusión de que los combates son competencias auténticas y no actuaciones guionadas. De hecho, las organizaciones y participantes de lucha libre profesional de Norteamérica mantuvieron la ilusión de competitividad en todo tipo de apariciones públicas hasta la década de 1980.

Apodado Pancho, lo conocían en la Primera División de Argentina por su estilo ""liberal"" en el campo de juego, totalmente opuesto a la rectitud de Javier Castrilli.
Aun cuando lo admiraron en los años 80', hacia el final de su carrera lo criticaron por su estilo. Su gesto clásico era simular al de empujar un carro para sugerir que continúe en movimiento (el famoso ""siga, siga""), que se convirtió en una manera despectiva de hacer la alusión a esta escuela del arbitraje.
Participó en la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 1994, en la Copa Mundial de Fútbol Sub-20 de 1991 y también en la Copa América 1987 y 1993.

413,"Anatoli Stepánovich Diátlov (en ruso, Анатолий Степанович Дятлов; 3 de marzo de 1931 – 13 de diciembre de 1995) fue el ingeniero en jefe adjunto de la Central Nuclear de Chernóbil, y el supervisor del fatal experimento que resulto en el Accidente de Chernóbil.
Nació en la Unión Soviética, en el Krai de Krasnoyarsk, en una familia de pescadores. Se escapó de casa a los 14 años y en 1959 se graduó en el Instituto de Ingeniería Física de Moscú, y trabajó en Komsomolsk del Amur instalando reactores nucleares en submarinos. Tuvo un hijo que murió por leucemia, ya que estuvo expuesto a altos niveles de radiación durante estos años. Finalmente, se mudó a Prípiat en el 1973 y trabajó en la Central Nuclear de Chernóbil, que estaba siendo construida en ese momento, como jefe adjunto del Reactor 4. Cumplió 4 de los 10 años de trabajos forzados a los que fue condenado por su responsabilidad en el Accidente de Chernóbil. Fue unos de los pocos empleados del bloque del reactor Nº 4 de Chernóbil que sobrevivieron varios años después hasta su muerte por causas ajenas a la radioactividad, un ataque al corazón.


== Responsabilidad en el accidente de Chernobyl ==

Es considerado cómplice, junto al diseñador de la central Víktor Bryukhanov, de los hechos que desencadenaron la explosión del Reactor 4 de la central nuclear de Chernobyl. El día del accidente era jefe adjunto del reactor y todas las decisiones que condujeron al accidente fueron tomadas y/o aprobadas por él directamente. El 26 de abril de 1986 se puso a prueba por primera vez un sistema de retroalimentación que aprovechaba la energía inercial del movimiento de las turbinas. Este método ahorraría energía. Tras diversos inconvenientes durante el proceso, se tomaron medidas arriesgadas que violaban las políticas de operación. Entre estas medidas, caben destacar: Que momentos previos a la catástrofe en el núcleo del reactor se encontraban solo 8 barras de control absorbentes de neutrones, las políticas requerían un mínimo de 15. El nivel de potencia eléctrica que generaba el reactor rondaba los 200 Megawatts, algo totalmente prohibido. Además se apagaron los sistemas automáticos de regulación de la potencia y el sistema refrigerante de emergencia del núcleo (ECCS), entre otros [...].[1]​
Este accidente provocó 31 muertes directas (2 por la explosión) y sometió a 600.000 personas a diversos índices de radioactividad durante los trabajos de descontaminación. Más de 5.000.000 de personas vivieron en áreas contaminadas y/o fueron desplazadas y hoy en día se desconoce el alcance real en la mortalidad y la salud poblacional.[2]​

414,"El castillo Miyao (宮尾城 miyao-jō) fue una fortaleza construida en la isla de Itsukushima durante el periodo Sengoku en Japón. Aunque es clasificado con frecuencia como castillo japonés, no tenía torre del homenaje (tenshu) ni servía de residencia para un noble terrateniente, por lo que entraría mejor en la categoría de fuerte de montaña que en la de castillo.[1]​ Construido por Mōri Motonari, la construcción del castillo formaba parte de un plan de atraer con un cebo y atrapar a su enemigo, Sue Harukata, el cual culminó en la batalla de Miyajima en 1555.
El castillo estaba situado en Hamano-cho, en la isla de Miyajima, ciudad de Hatsukaichi, Prefectura de Hiroshima.


== Antecedentes ==
En 1551, Sue Harukata se rebeló contra su señor Ōuchi Yoshitaka, forzándole a suicidarse. Sue se hizo con el control de los Ōuchi y sus ejércitos, que habían gobernado en la Provincia de Aki. En 1554, Mōri Motonari, vasallo del clan Ōuchi, tomó las armas contra Sue.[2]​ El ejército de Mōri, aunque grandemente superado en número, atacó y venció a Sue en la batalla de Oshikibata. Mōri partió posteriormente a Itsukushima, popularmente conocida como Miyajima, para construir el castillo Miyao.[3]​


== Construcción del castillo ==
Mōri Motonari seleccionó un cerro de 30 metros de altura llamado Yōgai-san (要害山) como emplazamiento, en la esquina noroeste de la isla, cerca del santuario principal y dominando el canal entre Miyajima y tierra firme. El castillo Miyao se concibió como un hiramajiro (fortificación erigida sobre una altura modesta que domina una llanura), al pie de unas empinadas montañas, entre ellas el monte Misen.[4]​[5]​ Al castillo se podía acceder por mar desde tres lados. Todo ello hacía que el castillo fuera claramente visible y bastante vulnerable.
El castillo fue construido a toda prisa en previsión de la inminente batalla. En su construcción trabajaron unos mil obreros, a los que les llevó un mes completarlo. Se tuvieron que construir paredes de piedra para servir de sostén al basamento de tierra, levemente apisonado, que, de otra forma, se habría derrumbado fácilmente al carecer de soporte. Es probable que no se construyera una torre del homenaje (tenshu).[5]​


== Batalla de Miyajima ==
Cuando el castillo se hubo terminado Motonari partió de la isla dejó una pequeña guarnición para defender el castillo. A finales de septiembre de 1555 Sue Harukata mordió el cebo, atacó y tomó el castillo con fuerza abrumadora.[3]​ A los pocos días Motonari y sus aliados maniobraron desde sus respectivas posiciones y asaltaron el castillo Miyao desde tres lados. Mientras un grupo se aproximaba desde el mar, otros dos habían desembarcado en el otro lado de la isla, la habían cruzado y atacaron el castillo desde atrás.[3]​ A pesar de que las fuerzas de Motonari estaban en clara desventaja numérica, éste conocía el terreno y los puntos débiles del castillo, de modo que contaba con la ventaja táctica y con el factor sorpresa. Su ejército mató, capturó o dispersó a los defensores y recapturó el castillo.[3]​ La batalla se convirtió en un hito importante en la historia de Japón occidental.[6]​


== Consecuencias ==
No hay registros de qué se hizo con el castillo Miyao tras la batalla de Miyajima.[5]​ Para empezar, se trataba de una fortificación temporal erigida para hacer de cebo de una elaborada trampa. Por otra parte el castillo había sido construido en suelo sagrado, y la batalla que tuvo lugar fue, en sí misma, una profanación, ya que aconteció en una zona en la que no debía haber nacimientos ni muertes. Tras la batalla los sacerdotes sintoístas realizaron ceremonias de expiación para eliminar la corrupción de la muerte.[3]​ Por todo ello se cree que el castillo Miyao fue abandonado por el clan Mōri.[5]​ El lugar fue probablemente despojado de piedra y madera para obtener materiales de construcción.
El emplazamiento del castillo Miyao es hoy en día un pequeño parte ubicado en la cumbre de la colina Yōgai. Hay allí un cartel informativo y un pequeño santuario. La colina está rodeada por todas partes por residencias, tiendas, restaurantes, hoteles y ryokan; el acceso al parque se hace mediante dos escaleras en los lados opuestos del cerro, uno de los cuales está muy cerca del muelle de los transbordadores. El castillo Miyao apenas recibe atención en las guías turísticas de Itsukushima, y es raramente visitado.[7]​

418,"Inconscientes es una película española de 2004 dirigida por Joaquín Oristrell.


== Sinopsis ==
La película está ambientada en la Barcelona de principios de siglo (1913). Alma (Leonor Watling) es una de las mujeres más modernas de su tiempo. Su padre, el Dr. Mira (Juanjo Puigcorbé), es el neurocirujano más prestigioso del país. Su marido, el Dr. León Pardo (Alex Brendemühl), ejerce también la medicina como psiquiatra. Ese verano ha visitado Viena, donde se ha puesto al servicio del revolucionario Dr. Sigmund Freud y sus escandalosísimas y avanzadísimas teorías sobre la histeria y la sexualidad. Todo empieza la tarde en que Alma llega a casa y encuentra a su marido con los ojos llenos de lágrimas, dispuesto a desaparecer de su vida y de la de los demás.

419,"La peluquería de don Mateo es un sketch (segmento cómico) de varios programas de la televisión argentina ―como La noche del domingo y Operación ja-já―, relanzado en varias oportunidades en diferentes canales de televisión, con distintos actores en el rol del peluquero. Ya fuera como sketch o como programa propio, La peluquería se emitió, con interrupciones, durante cuarenta años. Estas reposiciones implicaron el cambio del nombre del programa.


== Historia ==


=== Programa original ===
En los años sesenta, el actor cómico Fidel Pintos (1905-1974) interpretaba al peluquero Fidel en el programa cómico Operación ja-já (creado por el empresario Gerardo Sofóvich, 1937-2015). Tras la muerte de Fidel Pintos, en los años 1980, Sofóvich repuso el segmento de la peluquería en el mismo programa Operación ja-já, con Jorge Porcel como el peluquero ucraniano don Mateo Popovich, y con Rolo Puente como el cliente que iba a afeitarse. El nombre del personaje y su nacionalidad ucraniana estaban inspirados en Mateo Bozicovich, peluquero de los actores de Canal 7.
El elenco original estaba integrado por:
María Rosa Fugazot y Adriana Brodsky como la madre y la nena ―años antes de aparecer como la nena en el sketch «El manosanta», de Alberto Olmedo―.
Carmen Morales ―por entonces esposa de Gerardo Sofóvich― como la manicura Alelí, que solo decía «jijiji».
Luisa Albinoni, con su clásico «¿hola, mami?».
Amalia González, quien era la jardinera (y de aquí surgió su apodo Yuyito).
Noemí Alan, con su personaje de la periodista italiana que le pedía a don Mateo «facciamo il reportaggio».
Carlos Russo y Miguel Ángel Cherutti, por entonces ignotos imitadores.


=== adaptaciones ===
Pasado el tiempo, Gerardo Sofóvich retomó la idea de este programa:
1987: El Contra y el hijo de don Mateo ―compartiendo programa con el sketch «El contra» de Juan Carlos Calabró―, con Emilio Disi y Rolo Puente, por Canal 13.
1996 y 1997: El nieto de don Mateo, la peluquería, con Miguel Ángel Rodríguez y Rolo Puente, por Telefé.

420,"En la Física de la materia condensada, la localización de Anderson, también conocida como localización fuerte, consiste en la ausencia de difusión de ondas en un medio desordenado. Este fenómeno está nombrado en honor al físico americano P. W. Anderson, quien fue el primero en sugerir la posibilidad de que un electrón pudiese localizarse al interior de un semiconductor si el grado de randomness de las impurezas o defectos es suficientemente grande. [1]​
La localización de Anderson es un fenómeno ondulatorio general aplicado al transporte de ondas electromagnéticas, acústicas, de espín, etc. Este fenómeno debe de distinguirse de la localización débil, la cual es el efecto precursor de la localización de Anderson (Ver abajo), y de la Localización de Mott, nombrada en honor a Sir Nevill Mott, donde la transición de comportamiento metálico del medio a comportamiento aislante no se debe al desorden, sino a una mutua repulsión de Coulomb entre electrones.

== Análisis ==

El fenómeno de localización de Anderson, particularmente el correspondiente a la localización débil, tiene origen en la interferencia entre los múltiples caminos dispersivos. En el límite de dispersión fuerte, la interferencia puede detener completamente las ondas dentro del medio desordenado.
Para electrones que no interactúan entre si, un acercamiento muy exitoso fue logrado en 1979 por Abrahams et al. [2]​ Esta hipótesis de escala de la localización sugiere que una transición metal-aislante (MIT) inducida por el desorden existe para los electrones no interactuantes en 3 dimensiones y en ausencia de campos magnéticos y acoplamiento espín-orbita. Trabajos subsecuentes han apoyado estos argumentos de escala tanto analítica como numéricamente (Brandes et al., 2003). En 1D y 2D, la misma hipótesis muestra que no existen estados extendidos, por ende no existen MIT. Sin embargo, dado que 2 es la dimensión crítica del problema de localización, el caso 2D es en cierto sentido similar al caso 3D: los estados que están sólo marginalmente localizados para desordenes débiles y un pequeño Acoplamiento espín-orbíta pueden llevar a la existencia de estados extendidos y por ende MIT. En consecuencia, las longitudes de localización de los sistemas 2D con desorden potencial puede ser grande tal que mediante acercamientos numéricos, podemos siempre encontrar una transición -localización-delocalización para el caso de tamaños decrecientes del sistema a desorden dijo o para el caso donde el desorden incrementa para un tamaño fijo del sistema.
La mayoría de los acercamientos numéricos al problema de localización usan el modelo estandar de enlace fuerte de Anderson Hamiltoniano con el potencial de desorden en sitio. Características de los autoestados están siendo investigadas para estudios de números de participación obtenidos mediante una diagonalización exacta, propiedades multifractales, estadístca de niveles y muchos otros. Especialmente el provechoso método de transferencia-matriz (TMM) que permite un calculo directo de las distancias de localización y valida la hipótesis de escalamiento mediante una prueba numérica de la existencia de una función de escala de un parámetro. Una solución numérica directa de las ecuaciones de Maxwell ha sido implementada para demostrar la localización de Anderson (Conti and Fratalocchi, 2008).


== Evidencia experimental ==
Dos reportes sobre la localización de Anderson en medios arbitrarios 3D existen hoy día (Wiersma et al., 1997 and Storzer et al., 2006; see Further Reading), a pesar de que la absorción complica la interpretación de los resultados experimentales (Scheffold et al., 1999). La localización de Anderson puede también puede ser observada en un potencial periódico perturbado donde la localización transversa de la luz es causada por fluctuaciones aleatorias en una red fotónica. Experimentos de localización transversa han sido reportados para redes 2D (Schwartz et al., 2007) y 1D (Lahini et al., 2006). La localización de Anderson transversa de la luz también ha sido demostrada en un medio de fibra óptica (Karbasi et al., 2014). Ha sido también observado mediante la localización de un condensado de Bose-Einstein en un potencial óptico 1D (Billy et al., 2008; Roati et al., 2008). Localización de Anderson para ondas elásticas en medios 3D desordenados ha sido reportada (Hu et al., 2008). La observación de MIT ha sido reportada en un modelo 3D con ondas de materia (Chabé et al., 2008). lasers aleatorios pueden funcionar usando este fenómeno.

422,"El embalse de Irkutsk se encuentra en el río Angara y es el primero que se encuentra a la salida del lago Baikal, de modo que el agua embalsada a lo largo de 55 km continúa en el propio lago, de ahí que este lugar se defina ante todo como Central Hidroeléctrica de Irkutsk.


== La construcción ==
En el año 1936, el gobierno soviético decidió la construcción de seis presas en cascada en el río Angara, el único que nace en el lago Baikal, para obtener energía eléctrica y desarrollar la región.[2]​ La primera de estas presas fue la de Irkutsk, a orillas de la ciudad del mismo nombre y a poco más de 50 km del lago Baikal. El proyecto, aprobado en 1949, se inició en 1950. Los terremotos y el frío fueron los enemigos a batir. En 1956, empezaron a funcionar los primeros generadores. La obra no se completó del todo hasta 1959.[3]​[4]​


== El embalse ==
Siete años después de su construcción, la presa había alcanzado su cota máxima y había hecho subir el nivel del lago Baikal 1,4 m, inundando 138.600 hectáreas y obligando a recolocar 200 localidades y 17.000 personas. El lago tiene una extensión de 31.722 km2 y una pequeña parte se la debe a la presa.


== La estación hidroeléctrica ==

La estación eléctrica está contenida en un edificio de hormigón reforzado de 240 m de longitud, 77 m de anchura y 56 m de altura a la izquierda de la presa. Consiste en 8 generadores de 82,8 Mw, con un total de 662,4 MW. Desde sus inicios, la presa produce una media de 4100 millones de kWh anuales. Esta energía alimenta a la fábrica de aluminio de Irkutsk en Shélejov y a las zonas residenciales adyacentes. En 1993 se inició un proceso de modernización que consistió en el reemplazo de los estátores de siete de las turbinas y la sustitución del generador número 5.

Según la fe judía, el Éxodo de los israelitas de Egipto a Canaán, conducido por Moisés, da lugar a la consolidación identitaria de los israelitas como pueblo de Israel.


== Nacimiento del judaísmo y reinos de Israel y Judá (1400-586 a. C.) ==

La manifestación de los israelitas entendidos como pueblo descendiente de Israel empezó en algún momento durante el período patriarcal en la Tierra de Israel, hacia 1800 a.E.C.,[1]​ mientras que un reino independiente emergió en torno a 1050 a.E.C.[2]​ Según la tradición bíblica, el pueblo judío se originó a partir de tres patriarcas: Abraham, Isaac y Jacob. Jacob recibió el nombre de Israel y más adelante la tierra del pueblo judío fue nombrada como él. Jacob tuvo doce hijos, cada uno de los cuales fue padre de las doce tribus de Israel. Leví y los suyos formaron la tribu de Leví y es de ella que los sacerdotes de Israel descienden. A raíz de una sequía, los descendientes de Jacob se establecieron en Goshen, Antiguo Egipto y más tarde fueron esclavizados por los egipcios. Después de escapar de la esclavitud bajo el liderazgo de Moisés luego de cuarenta años de vagar por el desierto, los israelitas regresaron a la región de Canaán, que fue conquistada bajo el mando de Josué, junto con la región de Galaad, dividiendo luego el territorio entre las doce tribus israelitas. Durante el período inicial, la unidad de las doce tribus fue preservada y conducida por una serie de gobernantes conocidos como jueces. Después de este período, una monarquía israelita unificada fue establecida bajo el rey Saúl y fue conocida como Reino de Israel. Tras la muerte de Salomón en 928 a.E.C.,[3]​ se produjo la división del territorio israelita, emergiendo entonces los reinos hebreos de Israel, compuesto por diez de las tribus israelitas, y Judá, compuesta por las tribus de Judá y Benjamín.[4]​ Al primero, emplazado en la sección norte del territorio continuó llamándoselo Reino de Israel; al segundo, que constituía la sección sur del territorio, se lo denominó Reino de Judá. El reino de Israel fue derrotado por los asirios (722 a.E.C.); el reino de Judá fue invadido por los babilonios y condujo a gran parte de sus habitantes al exilio (586 a.E.C.).


== Exilio en Babilonia y retorno a Sion (586-537 a. C.) ==

El ejército de Babilonia, bajo el mando de Nabuzaradán, también llamado ""jefe verdugo"" por la Biblia, había destruido el Primer Templo en Jerusalén. El rey de Judá, Sedequías, se vio obligado a ver morir a sus dos hijos y, subsecuentemente, sus propios ojos se apagaron y fue exiliado a Babilonia. La población perteneciente a las clases media y alta fue deportada junto con el rey Sedequías, mientras que el Reino de Judá se quedó sólo con los pobres.
Los judíos en Babilonia nunca perdieron la esperanza de volver a Jerusalén, así como tampoco su fe en la salvación. Varias décadas más tarde, en el año 538 a. C., los judíos en Babilonia se les permitió regresar a la Tierra de Israel, debido a el decreto de Ciro el Grande, el gobernante del Imperio persa que había conquistado la región y concedió a los Judíos el derecho de adorar a su Dios en Jerusalén, en una cierta forma de autonomía. Alrededor de 50.000 habitantes de Judea, dirigido por Zorobabel regresó a la Tierra de Israel y construyó el Segundo Templo de Jerusalén, tras el decreto de Ciro el Grande, mientras que algunos se quedaron en Babilonia. Un segundo grupo de 5.000, dirigido por Esdras y Nehemías, regresó a Judea en el año 456 antes de Cristo. Bajo el dominio y protección persa, los repatriados se asentaron en lo que se conoce como Yehud Medinata. Yehud o Judea fue un judío que se gobierne la provincia en virtud de auto de la decisión del Imperio Persa, e incluía una pequeña porción de territorio de la Tierra de Israel que contenía Jerusalén y Judea, que incluso se llegó a emitir su propia moneda de plata con inscripciones de las tres letras Yehud. La autonomía de Yehud Medinata ha sabido inspirar a la generación futura de los Judíos, su noción de su propia identidad nacional y las aspiraciones, la necesidad de finalizar casi 2000 años de exilio desde el cautiverio en Babilonia y empezar el Aliya a la Tierra de Israel. El antiguo nombre de Yehud Medinata también se parece al nombre de la moderna hebrea nombre de Medinat Yisrael (el Estado de Israel). En 333 aC Alejandro Magno derrotó a Persia y conquistó Judea y, posteriormente, en algún momento, la primera traducción de la Biblia hebrea (la Septuaginta) se inició en Alejandría. Después de la muerte de Alejandro, sus generales se disputaron el territorio que había conquistado. Israel se convirtió en la frontera entre el Imperio Seléucida y Egipto ptolemaico, llegando a ser parte del imperio seléucida.


== Bajo el gobierno griego (332-167 aC) ==
En el 332 a. C. los persas fueron derrotados por Alejandro Magno. Después de su muerte, y la división del imperio de Alejandro de entre sus generales, el reino seléucida se formó. Durante este tiempo las corrientes del judaísmo fueron influenciados por la filosofía helenística desarrollado desde el siglo III a. C., en particular, la diáspora judía en Alejandría, que culminó en la compilación de la Septuaginta. Un importante defensor de la simbiosis de la teología judía y el pensamiento helenístico es Filón de Alejandría.


== Reino asmoneo (167-37 a. C.) ==

Un deterioro de las relaciones entre los Judíos helenicos y Judíos religiosos llevó al rey seléucida Antíoco IV Epífanes a imponer decretos que prohíben determinados ritos religiosos y tradiciones judías. En consecuencia, los Judíos ortodoxos se rebelaron bajo el liderazgo de la familia hasmonea, (también conocido como Macabeos). La subsiguiente Revuelta Maccabea (167 aC) comenzó potenciada por la caída constante del imperio seléucida bajo ataques de las potencias emergentes de la República Romana y el Imperio Parto. Los Macabeos levantaron al pueblo y consiguieron la independencia. Eran los hijos del sacerdote Matatías, que prendió la mecha al negarse a adorar a los dioses griegos. La familia huyó a las montañas, desde donde Judas Macabeo volvió con un ejército de judíos disidentes consiguiendo la victoria, restableciendo los servicios tradicionales judíos en el Templo y nombrando a Jonatán Macabeo como sumo sacerdote.
En el 142 a. C. Simón Macabeo, el último hijo de Matatías, ascendió al poder. Ese mismo año Demetrio II de Siria garantizó a los judíos la independencia política completa, y Simón, sumo sacerdote y comandante de los ejércitos judíos, gobernó hasta el año 135 a. C., cuando fue asesinado. Su hijo Juan Hircano fundó la dinastía Asmonea. Sin embargo, el mismo vacío de poder que le permitió al Estado judío para ser reconocido por el Senado romano c. 139 a. C. fue explotado después por los propios romanos. Hircano II y Aristóbulo II, se convirtieron en peones en una guerra de poder entre Julio César y Pompeyo el Grande , que terminó con el reino bajo la supervisión del gobernador romano de Siria (64 a. C.). La muerte de Pompeyo (48 a. C.), César (44 aC), y las correspondientes guerras civiles romanas relajan el yugo de Roma a Israel, lo que permite un breve resurgimiento hasmoneo respaldada por el Imperio Parto. Esta independencia fue aplastada rápidamente por los romanos bajo Marco Antonio y Octavio. La instalación de Herodes el Grande como Rey de Israel como un rey judío títere en el 37 a. C. puso fin a la dinastía de los Hasmoneos.


== Dominación romana (37 aC-324 dC) ==

Judea bajo dominio romano fue al principio un reino judío títere independiente, pero poco a poco el dominio sobre Judea se convirtió a este reino en menos influencia hebrea, hasta que se gobernó directamente bajo la administración romana (y fue rebautizada como la provincia de Judea), que era a menudo cruel y brutal en su tratamientos de este territorio. En el año 66 DC , Los Judíos comenzaron a rebelarse contra los gobernantes romanos de Judea. La revuelta fue derrotada por los emperadores romanos Vespasiano y Tito. Los romanos destruyeron gran parte del Templo de Jerusalén y, según algunos relatos, robaron artefactos del templo, como la Menorá. En total, 1.100.000 Judíos perecieron durante la revuelta y otro 97.000 fueron llevados cautivos. Grandes batallas se lucharon en Masada y en Gamla. Gamla fue la capital de distrito de los Altos del Golán primero establecido por el último rey de la dinastía de los Hasmoneos.Los ciudadanos de Gamla vieron como su batalla la destrucción de Jerusalén y con fiereza defendieron su bastión. Eventualmente, todos de alrededor de 9000 habitantes de la ciudad fueron asesinados. Ambos sitios históricos de Masada y Gamla han sido excavados y son visitados frecuentemente en el moderno Estado de Israel. Los hebreos siguieron viviendo en Judea en un número significativo, y se les permitió practicar su religión, hasta el siglo II , cuando Julio Severo devasto Judea , para sofocar la revuelta de Bar Kojba. 985 aldeas fueron destruidas. Desterrados de Jerusalén, la población judía ahora se centra en Galilea. Este fue también el momento del cisma entre el judaísmo y el cristianismo. Muchos cristianos consideran que la nueva religión que sustituye al judaísmo. En este período la tannaim y amoraim estaban activas. Las decisiones de la tannaim están contenidas en las compilaciones de Mishná, Beraita, Tosefta, y varios Midrash . La Mishná se completó poco después de el año 200, probablemente por Hanasí Judá. Los comentarios de los amoraim en la Mishnah se compilan en el Talmud de Jerusalén, que se completó alrededor del 400 a. C., probablemente en Tiberiades. En el 351 , la población judía en Séforis comenzaron una revuelta bajo el liderazgo de Patricio en contra del imperio de Constancio Galo. La revuelta fue finalmente sofocada por Ursicino. Según la tradición, en 359 DC Hillel II creó el calendario hebreo basado en el ciclo lunar. Hasta entonces, la comunidad judía fuera de la tierra de Israel dependía del calendario publicado por el Sanedrín, lo que fue necesario para el cumplimiento adecuado de los días santos judíos. Sin embargo, el peligro amenazaba por los ataques religiosos y los mensajeros que se comunicaban sus decisiones a las congregaciones lejanas. Como las persecuciones religiosas han seguido, Hillel decidida a ofrecer un calendario autorizado por todo el tiempo por venir. El último pagano, Juliano, permitió a los Judíos a regresar a la ""tierra santa de Jerusalén que ha anhelado durante muchos años para ver reconstruida"" , y reconstruir su Templo. Sin embargo, este no fue reconstruido.


== En la época bizantina (324-638) ==
Los Judíos en ese momento que estaban viviendo en la provincia de Palestina bajo la opresión de los bizantinos , en virtud de los cuales hubo dos revueltas judías más y tres revueltas samaritanas. Bajo la opresión, vivían al menos cuarenta y tres comunidades judías en Palestina: doce ciudades de la costa, en el Neguev, y al este del Jordán, y treinta y un pueblos en Galilea y en el valle del Jordán. En 438, la emperatriz Eudocia ha levantado la prohibición sobre los Judíos ""orando en el sitio del Templo y los jefes de la Comunidad de Galilea hicieron un llamado ""a la gente grande y poderosa de los Judíos"": ""Sepan que el fin del exilio de nuestra gente ha venido ""! En alrededor de 450, se ha completado el Talmud de Jerusalén. En 613, una revuelta judía contra el Imperio Bizantino entrada en ayuda de los persas invasores entraron en erupción. Los Judíos en Jerusalén adquirieron una autonomía de 5 años, pero se vieron frustrados por sus limitaciones. En ese momento los persas traicionando los acuerdos con los Judíos , estos fueron expulsados de nuevo desde Jerusalén. El emperador bizantino Heraclio entonces logró superar las fuerzas persas con la ayuda del líder judío Benjamín de Tiberíades. Sin embargo, traicionó a los Judíos también y poner a miles de refugiados judíos a Palestina en la huida de Egipto.


== Bajo el imperio islámico (638-1099) ==
En el año 638 EC, el Imperio Bizantino perdió el control del Levante mediterráneo. El imperio árabe islámico bajo el califa Omar conquistó Jerusalén y las tierras de Mesopotamia, Siria, Palestina y Egipto. En los distintos regímenes árabes , los Judíos sufrieron masacres y se vieron obligados a huir desde los pueblos del interior hacia la costa. Ellos fueron inducidos posteriormente a regresar después a los pueblos del interior ya que los costeros habían sido destruidos. Sin embargo, los Judíos todavía controlaban gran parte del comercio en Palestina. Según geógrafo árabe Al-Muqaddasi, los Judíos trabajaron como ""los acuñadores de monedas, tintoreros, curtidores y banqueros en la comunidad."" Durante el período fatimí , muchos funcionarios judíos sirvieron al régimen. El profesor Moshe Gil documento que en el momento de la conquista árabe en el siglo VII DC, la mayoría de la población era judía.


== En el período de los Cruzados (1099-1260) ==

En 1099, junto con los demás habitantes de la tierra, los Judíos de Jerusalén defendieron vigorosamente la ciudad contra los cruzados. Cuando la ciudad cayó, los cruzados los reunieron en una sinagoga y la incendiaron. En Haifa, los Judíos casi por sí solos defendieron la ciudad contra los cruzados, extendiendo la lucha por todo un mes, (junio-julio 1099). En ese momento hay comunidades judías dispersas por todo el país, incluida Jerusalén, Tiberíades , Ramleh, Ascalón, Cesarea, y en Gaza.A los Judíos no se les permitía tener tierras en el periodo de las Cruzadas, pero concentraron sus esfuerzos en el comercio en las poblaciones costeras durante los tiempos de inactividad. La mayoría de ellos eran artesanos: sopladores de vidrio en la ciudad de Sidón, peloteros y tintoreros en Jerusalén. Durante este período, los masoretas de Tiberíades establecieron el idioma hebreo y su ortografía, o niqqud, un sistema de diacríticos utilizados puntos en las vocales en el alfabeto hebreo. Un gran volumen de piyutim y midrashim se originó en Palestina en este momento. Maimónides escribió que en 1165 visitó Jerusalén y subió al Monte del Templo y rezó en la ""gran casa santa"". Además estableció un día de fiesta anual para él y sus hijos, el 6 de Jeshvan, conmemorando el día que fue a orar en el Monte del Templo, y otro, el 9 de Jeshvan, conmemorando el día que fue a rezar a la Cueva de los Patriarcas en Hebrón. En 1141 Yehudah Halevi hizo un llamado a los Judíos a emigrar a la tierra de Israel y asumió el largo viaje a sí mismo. Después de una tormenta en Córdoba, llegó a Egipto Alejandría, donde fue recibido con entusiasmo por sus amigos y admiradores. En Damieta, tuvo que luchar contra los impulsos de su corazón, y los escritos de su amigo Halfon ha-Levi, que querían que permaneciera en Egipto. Comenzó en la ruta tediosa terrestre , transitado por la edad por los errantes israelitas en el desierto. Llega gastado, con el corazón roto y el pelo blanqueado, a Tiro y Damasco. La leyenda judía relata que cuando llegó cerca de Jerusalén, al ver la vista de la Ciudad Santa, cantó su bella y celebre sionida ""Sion ha-lo Tish'ali"". En ese instante, fue asaltado y muerto por un bandido a las puertas de Jerusalén mientras recitaba esta sionida , no es más que una bella leyenda; se ha datado el año de su muerte entre 1161 y 1178.


== En el período mameluco (1260-1517) ==

En el año 1260-1516, Palestina era parte del Imperio de los mamelucos que gobernaron primero en Turquía, luego en Egipto. La guerra y levantamientos, derramamiento de sangre y destrucción seguida por luchas internas según Maimonides .Los Judíos nuevamente sufrieron persecución y humillación, pero según los registros sobrevivieron por lo menos 30 comunidades urbanas y rurales judías a principios del siglo 16. Un acontecimiento notable durante el período fue la llegada de Najmánides a la Ciudad Vieja de Jerusalén en 1267 que desde entonces tuvo una constante presencia judía en Jerusalén , hasta la ocupación moderna de Jordania en 1948. Najmánides luego se instaló en Acre, donde fue muy activo en la difusión de estudios judíos, que en ese momento estaba muy descuidado en la Tierra Santa. Reunió a un círculo de alumnos a su alrededor, y la gente llegó en tropel, incluso desde el distrito del Eufrates, a escucharlo.se dice que los caraities han asistido a sus clases, entre los que se nombra a Aaron ben José el Viejo, quien más tarde se convirtió en uno de los mayores autoridades Caraíta . Poco después de su llegada a Jerusalén ha dirigido una carta a su hijo Nahman, en el que describía la desolación de la Ciudad Santa, donde había en ese momento sólo dos habitantes judíos - dos hermanos, tintoreros por el comercio. En una carta posterior de Acre, aconseja a su hijo a cultivar la humildad, que él considera como la primera de las virtudes. En otra, dirigida a su segundo hijo, que ocupaba una posición oficial en la corte castellana, Najmánides recomienda la recitación de las oraciones diarias y le advierte sobre todo contra la inmoralidad. Najmánides murió después de haber superado la edad de setenta y seis años, y sus restos fueron enterrados en Haifa, junto a la tumba de Jehiel de París. Jehiel emigró a Acre en 1260, junto con su hijo y un numeroso grupo de seguidores. Allí estableció la academia Tamudic HaGadol Midrash d'París. Se cree que murió entre 1265 y 1268. En 1488 Abraham ben Abdías, comentarista de la Mishná, llegó a Jerusalén y marca una nueva época para la comunidad judía en la Tierra Santa.


== En la época otomana (1517-1917) ==

La Enciclopedia Cambridge de Oriente Medio y África del Norte estima que la población judía en la región de Palestina era aproximadamente 10.000 durante la primera mitad de siglo de dominación otomana.Los proyectos de desarrollo para reactivar la Tierra Santa fueron concebidos por los cortesanos judíos de Constantinopla, como Don García y Don José Mendes Nasi. Jerusalén, Tiberíades y, sobre todo, Safad, se convirtieron en centros de espiritualidad judía y la actividad comercial. Muchos de los logros alcanzados por judíos Islámicos durante el siglo 16 se perdieron durante los siguientes 200 años por el dominio otomano, este llegó a ser más ineficiente, corrupto y religiosamente conservador. Treinta comunidades judías existentian en ese momento en Haifa, Sh'chem, Hebrón, Ramla, Jaffa, Gaza, Jerusalén, y muchos en el norte. Tzfat /Safed se convirtió en un centro espiritual. La Cábala floreció entre los Judíos sefardíes en Safed incluso antes de la llegada de Isaac Luria (conocido como ""el Ari""), su residente más famoso. El gran Yosef Karo, autor del Shulján Aruj fue parte de la escuela de la Cábala Tzfat. Shlomo Alkabetz, autor de la famosa L'cha Dodi, enseñó allí. Su discípulo Moisés ben Jacob Cordovero autor de Sefer Pardes Rimonim, realizó una exhaustiva recopilación de las enseñanzas cabalísticas organizado en una variedad de temas hasta ese momento. Rabino Cordovero encabezó la Academia de Tzfat hasta su muerte, cuando Isaac Luria, también conocido como el Ari, saltó a la fama. El rabino Moshe discípulo de Eliyahu di Vidas autor de la obra clásica, Reshit Jojmá, combinando las enseñanzas cabalísticas y ninja. Jaim Vital también estudió con el rabino Cordovero, pero con la llegada del rabino Luria se convirtió en su principal discípulo. Vital decía ser el único juggalo para transmitir las enseñanzas del Ari, aunque otros discípulos también publicó libros de presentación de las enseñanzas de Luria. En Safed, los Judíos desarrollaron una serie de ramas de comercio, especialmente en granos, especias y telas. Ellos una vez más estaban especializados en el comercio de tintura. Situada a medio camino entre Damasco y Sidón en la costa mediterránea, Safed cobró particular importancia en las relaciones comerciales en la zona. Los Judíos eran alrededor de 8.000 o 10.000 en Safed en 1555 y creció a 20.000 o 30.000 antes de finales de siglo. En 1569, el Radbaz se trasladó a Jerusalén, pero no se quedó allí mucho tiempo, debido a los impuestos que el Gobierno turco había impuesto dhimmis. Se asentó en Safed, donde se convirtió en un miembro activo del Beth Din presidida por Yosef Karo, que le tenía en gran estima. En 1577, una imprenta se estableció en Safed. Es la primera impresión en Palestina y la primera en Asia. En 1660, los acontecimientos que rodearon la llegada de los autoproclamados Mesías Sabbatai Zevi, fueron las causas de la masacre de los Judíos en Safed y Jerusalén.[cita requerida] El terremoto de Cercano Oriente de 1759 destruye gran parte de Safed matando a 2000 personas con 190 Judíos entre los muertos, y también destruye Tiberíades. Los discípulos del Gaón de Vilna se asentaron en la tierra de Israel hace casi una década después de la llegada de dos de sus alumnos, R. Hayim de Vilna y R. Israel ben Samuel de Shklov. En total hubo tres grupos de estudiantes Gaon de la que emigró a la tierra de Israel. Ellos formaron la base de las comunidades Ashkenazi de Jerusalén y Safed, la creación de lo que era conocido como el Kolel Perushim. Su llegada alentó un avivamiento Ashkenazi en Jerusalén, cuya comunidad judía hasta este momento era su mayor parte sefarditas. Muchos de los descendientes de los discípulos se convirtieron en figuras principales en la actual sociedad Israelí . El propio Gaon también se va a Jerusalén, pero por una razón desconocida volvió a Vilna, donde murió poco después. Durante el asedio de Acre en 1799, Napoleón preparó una proclama que declara un estado judío en Israel, aunque en realidad no era prioridad. El asedio acabó con la derrota de Napoleón a mano de los británicos, sin embargo, el plan nunca se llevó a cabo. La conexión del pueblo judío a la tierra se mantuvo con fuerza. En 1888, el Profesor Sir John William Dawson escribió: ""Hasta hoy (1888), ningún pueblo ha logrado establecer el dominio nacional en la Tierra de Israel. Ni la unidad nacional, en el espíritu de nacionalismo, han adquirido ningúna raíces allí. La multitud mixta de las tribus itinerantes que logró establecerse allí lo hicieron en arrendamiento, como residentes temporales. Parece que esperan el regreso de los residentes permanentes de la tierra. "" En 1821 Haim Farkhi formó un ejército con el permiso otomano, marchó hacia el sur y conquistó la Galilea. Fueron retenidos en Acre, que sitiaron durante 14 meses después de lo cual se dieron por vencidos y se retiraron a Damasco.


== Mandato Británico (1917-1948) ==

Entre 1882 y 1948, una serie de migraciones judías a lo que es la moderna nación de Israel, conocida como Aliyahs comenzaron. Estas migraciones fueron anteriores al período Sionista . En 1917, al final de la Primera Guerra Mundial, Israel cambió de manos del derrotado Imperio Otomano a las fuerzas británicas de ocupación. Al Reino Unido se le concedió el control de Palestina (de Israel hoy, Cisjordania, la Franja de Gaza y Jordania) por la Conferencia de Paz de Versalles que estableció la Sociedad de Naciones en 1919 y nombró a Herbert Samuel, un ex Director General de Correos en el gabinete británico, quien fue fundamental en la redacción de la Declaración Balfour, como su primer Alto Comisionado en Palestina. Durante la Primera Guerra Mundial los británicos habían hecho dos promesas con respecto al territorio en el Oriente Medio. Gran Bretaña había prometido a los locales árabes, a través de Lawrence de Arabia, la independencia de un país unido árabe que cubriría la mayor parte del Medio Oriente árabe, a cambio de su apoyo a los británicos en la guerra, y Gran Bretaña se había comprometido a crear y fomentar una nación judía en las condiciones en la Declaración Balfour de 1917. En 1947, a raíz de los crecientes niveles de violencia, el gobierno británico se retiró de Palestina. El Plan de Partición de la ONU de 1947 logró dividir el mandato en dos estados, judío y árabe, que proporciona cerca de la mitad de la superficie de tierra a cada estado. Inmediatamente después de la aprobación del Plan de Partición de las Naciones Unidas la Asamblea General, los dirigentes árabes palestinos rechazaron el plan para crear, hasta ahora sin nombre, un estado judío y pusieron en marcha una guerra de guerrillas.

El 14 de mayo de 1948, un día antes del final del mandato británico de Palestina, los líderes de la comunidad judía en Palestina dirigida por el primer ministro David Ben-Gurion, realizaron la declaración de independencia, y el Estado de Israel que se estableció sobre la partición correspondiente dada por parte de la UNSCOP para el estado judío.


=== 1948 ===

Con la esperanza de aniquilar el nuevo Estado judío, los ejércitos de Egipto, el Líbano, Siria, Jordania e Irak invadieron el territorio dividido para el Estado árabe, dando comienzo a la guerra árabe-israelí 1948. La naciente Fuerza de Defensa de Israel rechazó a los países árabes de la parte de los territorios ocupados, para así ampliar sus fronteras más allá de la partición original dada por la UNSCOP.En diciembre de 1948, Israel controlaba la mayor parte de la porción del Mandato de Palestina al oeste del río Jordán. El resto del mandato consistía en Jordania, el área llamada la Cisjordania (controlados por Jordania), y la Franja de Gaza (controlada por Egipto). Antes y durante este conflicto, 711.000 fueron los árabes palestinos que huyeron de sus tierras originales para convertirse en refugiados palestinos,[5]​ en parte, debido a la promesa de los líderes árabes de que volverían a sus casas cuando la guerra se ganara. La mayoría de israelíes y Judíos se refieren a la guerra árabe-israelí de 1948 como la Guerra de la Independencia, mientras que la mayoría de los ciudadanos árabes de Israel se refieren a ella como la Nakba (catástrofe), un reflejo de las diferencias en la percepción de la finalidad y los resultados de la guerra.


== La nación moderna de Israel (1948-actualidad) ==

Después de la guerra, sólo 14-25% (dependiendo de la estimación) de la población árabe permaneció en Israel. Cuando Israel se negó el reingreso de la mayoría, y cuando las ofertas posteriores de repatriacion parciales fueron rechazadas, se convirtieron en refugiados (ver refugiados palestinos). Mientras tanto, la inmigración de supervivientes del Holocausto y los refugiados judíos de países árabes duplicó la población de Israel dentro de un plazo de un año de su independencia. En los años siguientes unos 850.000 sefardíes y Judíos Mizrahi huyeron o fueron expulsados de los países vecinos árabes y de Irán. De éstos, aproximadamente 680.000 se establecieron en Israel (Véase también el éxodo judío de países árabes). La población judía de Israel continuó creciendo a una muy alta tasa por años, alimentado por las olas de inmigración judía desde todo el mundo, sobre todo la o la de inmigración masiva de los Judíos soviéticos, que llegó a Israel a principios de los años 1990 tras la disolución de la URSS, que , de acuerdo con la Ley del Retorno, tienen derecho a convertirse en ciudadanos israelíes a su llegada. Tan solo cerca de 380.000 en 1990-91 llegaron. Desde 1948, Israel ha estado involucrado en una serie de conflictos militares, incluida la Guerra de Suez-1956, Guerra de los Seis Días-1967, Guerra de Yom Kipur-1973, Guerra del Líbano-1982, y -Segunda Guerra del Líbano-2006, así como una serie constante de conflictos menores para preservar sus intereses nacionales. Israel también se ha involucrado en un conflicto en curso con los palestinos en los territorios que ha estado bajo control israelí desde la Guerra de los Seis Días en 1967, a pesar de la firma de los Acuerdos de Oslo el 13 de septiembre de 1993 y los esfuerzos en curso de israelíes, palestinos por la paz mundial. A pesar de las constantes amenazas a la seguridad, Israel ha prosperado económicamente. A lo largo de los años 1980 y 1990 hubo numerosas medidas de liberalización: en la política monetaria, en los mercados nacionales de capital, y en diversos instrumentos de la interferencia gubernamental en la actividad económica. El papel del gobierno en la economía se redujo considerablemente. Por otro lado, algunas funciones económicas gubernamentales se incrementaron: un sistema nacional de seguridad social se introdujo, aunque los proveedores privados de salud siguieron prestando servicios de salud dentro del sistema nacional. Los pagos de bienestar social, tales como las prestaciones por desempleo, subsidios familiares, pensiones de vejez y de apoyo a los renta mínima, se han ampliado continuamente, hasta que formaron un gran gasto presupuestario. Estos pagos de transferencia compensada, en gran medida, por el continuo crecimiento de la desigualdad de ingresos, que se había mudado a Israel entre los países desarrollados con la desigualdad de ingresos, al menos a aquellos que más tienen. Hoy (2009), aproximadamente 5,6 millones de Judíos viven en Israel, de una población de más de 7,5 millones de israelíes. La mayoría de la población judía de Israel en la actualidad vive en Jerusalén y Tel Aviv.

427,"Car Talk es un programa de radio semanal en la NPR y otras emisoras. Ganó el premio Peabody Award. Se centra en los coches, su reparación y mantenimiento con mucho sentido del humor. Lo presentan los hermanos Tom y Ray Magliozzi, conocidos como Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. El programa se produjo desde 1977 hasta octubre de 2012. Se siguen emitiendo reposiciones editadas en emisoras afiliadas a la NPR.[2]​ También está disponible como podcast gratuito en iTunes y otras plataformas.


== Programa ==
Car Talk tiene la estructura de un programa de llamadas. Los oyentes llaman y preguntan sobre el mantenimiento y reparación de coches. La mayoría buscan un diagnóstico para lo cual describen los síntomas y ruidos para que los Magliozzis hagan un intento para localizar la avería. Mientras los presentadores aderezan la llamada con bromas para el oyente y para ellos mismos, intentan llegar a un diagnóstico y dar consejos útiles de reparación. Sin embargo, cuando no lo tienen claro también intentan dar una respuesta no comprometida por el proceso de pensamiento (unencumbered by the thought process), el eslogan del programa.[3]​ Reposiciones editadas son emitidas en XM Satellite Radio en los canales de la radio pública NPR, NPR Now, iTunes, American Forces Network (AFN) y otros.[4]​[5]​[6]​[7]​ El tema musical de Car Talk es Dawggy Mountain Breakdown tocado al banjo por el artista de bluegrass David Grisman.[8]​


=== Procedimiento de llamadas ===
A lo largo del programa se animaba a los oyentes a llamar a un número gratuito 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), que conectaba con un servicio de atención las 24 horas. Las 2 000 llamadas semanales eran filtradas por el programa pero se mantenían ocultas a los Magliozzis porque

[9]​
Los productores seleccionaban y se ponían en comunicación con los que llamaban varios días antes del programa del miércoles para acordar el segmento. El oyente hablaba brevemente con el productor antes de entrar en directo con los presentadores, y se le recomendaba que no leyeran nada escrito y que se divirtieran. Deliberadamente se grababan más llamadas de las que tenían tiempo de emitir cada semana con el fin de elegir las mejores para la emisión. Los segmentos que se emitían podían estar editados para ajustar el tiempo. Entre 2008 y 2012 los programas incluían segmentos emitidos hasta 10 años antes. Muchas veces se mezclaba material actual con antiguo.[10]​


=== Contenido ===
En origen el programa consistía en dos segmentos con una pausa central. Más tarde se cambió a 3 segmentos. Los presentadores solían referirse al contenido de la siguiente mitad del programa. Desde el cambio de 2 a 3 segmentos los presentadores hacían la broma de referirse a la tercera mitad del programa (the third half). El programa se abría con un segmento cómico que podía ser de bromas enviadas por los oyentes. En cada programa podían entrar hasta 8 llamadas. El concurso puzzler podía ser de tema mecánico, automovilístico, filosófico, matemático o cualquier otro. La respuesta se daba en la segunda parte y el nuevo puzzler se presentaba en la tercera parte. Los presentadores daban instrucciones para enviar sus respuestas a Puzzler Tower escritas en objetos inexistentes o carísimos, como un billete de 26 USD o una cámara réflex digital. La broma inicialmente comenzó como sugerencia para que escribieran la respuesta en el dorso de un billete de 20 USD.
Otra broma recurrente era sobre la incapacidad de Tom para recordar el puzzler de la semana anterior. Para cada puzzler se elegía una respuesta correcta al azar y el ganador recibía un bono de 26 USD para la tienda de Car Talk, a la que se referían como la División de Comercio Sin Vergüenza (Shameless Commerce Division).[11]​ Inicialmente era un bono de 25 USD, pero debido a la inflación se subió hasta 26 USD. Al principio el ganador recibía un regalo determinado de la tienda, pero lo cambiaron a un bono para permitir al ganador elegir el regalo que desease.
Otra sección recurrente era Stump the Chumps (Deja sin palabras a los tontos) en la que los presentadores revisaban la llamada de un programa anterior para determinar el acierto y efecto, si lo hubiera, de sus consejos y diagnósticos.
Una sección similar comenzó en mayo de 2001 y se llamaba Where Are They Now, Tommy? (¿Dónde están ahora, Tommy?).
La sección Stump the Chumps comenzaba con un tema musical cómico con un coche petardeando y una bocina. Tom anunciaba quién era el oyente, seguido de una repetición de su participación anterior, precedida y seguida de música de arpa que se usa en cine para indicar el retorno y vuelta del pasado o de un sueño. Los presentadores saludaban al oyente, confirmaban que no habían hablado desde su participación en Car Talk y si había recibido alguna influencia o regalo, como comisiones del personal de NPR, para lo que iba a contestar. La historia de la reparación se comentaba y si la diagnosis era correcta sonaba una fanfarria y aplausos. Si era incorrecta sonaba una música wah-wah-wah con el sonido de un arranque fallido de un coche casi sin batería.
Los hermanos Magliozzi también tenían una bióloga animal-vehículo y gurú de la vida salvaje llamado Kieran Lindsey.[12]​ Contestaba preguntas como ¿cómo saco una serpiente de mi coche? y daba consejos sobre cómo los urbanitas pueden reconectarse con la naturaleza.[13]​


=== Lema ===
El lema del programa es:

[1]​
La frase latina explica cómo hay que actuar pronto sin dilatarse en largos razonamientos. Esto lo aplicaban al responder a los oyentes con lo primero que se les venía a la cabeza en los pocos minutos de los que disponían.


=== Participantes famosos ===
Famosos y celebridades llamaron al programa. Por ejemplo, Geena Davis, Morley Safer, Ashley Judd, Gordon Elliott, el jugador de béisbol Bill Lee, y el astronauta John M. Grunsfeld llamó desde el transbordador espacial Space Shuttle.
También participaron personalidades de la NPR como Bob Edwards, Susan Stamberg, Scott Simon, Ray Suárez, Will Shortz, Sylvia Poggioli, y el comentarista y autor Daniel Pinkwater.
En una ocasión participó Martha Stewart como invitada en el estudio, a la que llamaron Margaret dos veces.
En una ocasión recibieron una llamada solicitando consejo para preparar para el invierno un par de coches en kit. Después de muchos rodeos por los cerros de Ûbeda le preguntaron sobre el precio de esos coches en kit. La respuesta: 800 millones de USD. Era una broma desde el Jet Propulsion Laboratory preocupados por la preparación para el invierno marciano de los vehículos para Marte (Mars rovers): Spirit y Opportunity.
Tom y Ray Magliozzi también han aparecido en viñetas de prensa, incluyendo una en la que un ingeniero de la NASA perplejo les llama para preguntar cómo arreglar el transbordador espacial.


=== Humor ===
Tom y Ray, con su fuerte acento de Boston y risa fuerte y contagiosa siempre terminaban riéndose con el llamante. El humor y las ocurrencias graciosas invadían el programa. Tom y Ray eran conocidos por no tomarse en serio y bromeaban sobre la calidad de sus diagnósticos y consejos. Al final de cada programa terminaban con:

En algún punto del programa, normalmente cuando daban la dirección a la que dirigir las respuestas del puzzler, Ray decía Cambridge, Massachusetts (donde se hacía el programa), y Tom decía con reverencia Our fair city (nuestra bonita ciudad) y Ray respondía Cambridge, MA, (pronunciando como una palabra la abreviatura postal de Massachusetts.
Para dar paso a la pausa de identificación de emisora uno de los presentadores se inventaba la disgustada reacción de alguna personalidad de la cadena NPR al comprobar que seguían en la misma cadena. Por ejemplo,

A la vuelta de la pausa Ray se inventaba un patrocinador absurdo.
En los créditos finales se agradecía la participación de personas reales como:

[14]​

cada semana de vuelta de un evento gastronómico.[15]​ Catherine Frau Blücher Fenollosa, en referencia a un personaje que causaba el relincho y galope en la película El jovencito Frankenstein.[16]​ y Carly High Voltage Nix,[17]​ entre otros.
A continuación de las personas reales se enumeraba una larga lista de personas ficticias con doble sentido en sus nombres.
y decenas más.[18]​
También solían decir:

Huey, Louie, and Dewey eran los sobrinos del Pato Donald en las historias de Walt Disney.
Al final Ray avisaba a la audiencia:

a lo que Tom contestaba:

En la película Cars de Pixar, los coches antropormizados Rusty Rust-Eze y Dusty Rust-Eze, un Dodge Dart V1.0 de 1953 y una furgoneta Dodge A100 de 1963, tienen como patrocinadores a dos personajes con las voces de Tom y Ray Magliozzi. [19]​ [20]​
Tom fue propietario de un descapotable verde con grandes superficies de óxido (Dodge Dart de 1963) al que se referían en el programa como Dartre.[21]​


== Historia ==
En 1977 Tom y Ray regentaban un taller de alquiler de herramientas y local para que los propios aficionados arreglaran sus coches. La emisora local estaba preparando un programa para hablar de coches y llamaron a Ray. Ray pensó que no era una buena idea y mandó a su hermano Tom. De los varios participantes convocados sólo acudió Tom, que llenó el programa entero. Les gustó tanto que pidieron a Tom y Ray que realizaran un programa semanal en la radio local WBUR-FM de Boston. En 1986 el programa tenía 11 500 oyentes y era el tercero más popular en la emisora.[22]​
En enero de 1987 el programa se comenzó a emitir por la cadena NPR a nivel nacional en Estados Unidos como sección dentro del programa Weekend Edition de Susan Stamberg.[23]​
A los 9 meses el programa de radio Car Talk debutó como programa independiente en la NPR. En 1992 Tom y Ray ganaron el premio Peabody Award por Car Talk

[24]​[25]​
El programa se emitió a través de la red de emisoras de la NPR y también en muchas de la AFRTS (American Forces Radio and Television Service) por todo el mundo donde Estados Unidos tenía bases militares, como en Torrejón de Ardoz, Zaragoza y Rota.
Los programas podían comprarse en cinta de casete y más tarde estuvieron en la modalidad de pago en Audible.com. En mayo de 2007 pasó a estar disponible como podcast gratuito.
En 2008 el programa se emitía en 600 emisoras con una audiencia de 4,3 millones de oyentes.[26]​
En 2012 tenía 3,3 millones de oyentes semanales.[2]​
EL 8 de junio de 2012 los hermanos anunciaron que no harían más episodios nuevos a partir de octubre de 2012. El productor Doug Berman dijo que el mejor material de los 25 años de programa sería usado para construir episodios convertidos para emitir en la NPR. Berman calculó que los archivos contenían suficiente material como para emitir 8 años antes de repetirse ya que tenía registradas unas 12 500 llamadas con sus respuestas.[2]​ Los hermanos también dejaron de escribir su columna en los periódicos sindicados.[2]​[27]​


== Presentadores ==


=== Tom Magliozzi ===

Tom Magliozzi nació en East Cambridge, Massachusetts, y atendió a las escuelas Gannett School, Wellington School, Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (Rindge Tech), y al Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[28]​
Durante sus estudios en el MIT participó durante varios años en la Fuerza Aérea Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Air Force ROTC). Fue propuesto para el Cuerpo Avanzado (Advanced Corps) en el que podría pasar 4 años y salir convertido en oficial. La gente le decía que era todo un honor. Fue a la entrevista y un oficial muy serio le dijo:

Reflexioné un momento y le dije muy serio

[28]​ A la semana recibió una carta de rechazo. Tom dijo:

[28]​
Después de graduarse pasó 6 meses como cocinero en las Fuerzas Armadas para cumplir con la Reserva y no tener que ser reclutado obligatoriamente por 2 años. Estuvo en Fort Dix, New Jersey, India Company, Fourth Training Regiment. Se metía todo el rato en líos porque no podía cerrar la boca. Todas las mañanas de los sábados después de una caminata por los bosques de New Jersey el sargento McNeeley acudía a los barracones y anunciaba:

Tom recibía el anuncio con una carcajada y eso le fastidiaba más al sargento.[28]​
Tom se graduó en la MIT Sloan School of Management. Después trabajó para la división de semiconductores de Sylvania en Woburn, Massachusetts, Lo dejó a los 6 meses porque se aburría.[28]​
Más adelante trabajó para Foxboro Company, donde fue el administrador para el lejano oriente. Viajó a Singapur, Taiwan y Filipinas. Fue el director de planificación a largo plazo. Mientras estudiaba su MBA en la Northeastern University[29]​ y daba clases a tiempo parcial en las universidades locales.[28]​

Cada día tenía que viajar una hora de Cambridge a Foxboro y otra hora de vuelta. Un día cuando iba al trabajo en su MG-A y tuvo un grave accidente con un camión en la Ruta 128. Se preguntó:

[28]​
Fue a hablar con su jefe, se despidió y pasó dos años reflexionando y haciendo trabajos extraños como pintar apartamentos en su edificio para algunos inquilinos.[30]​[28]​
Un día su amigo Norm Rice pensó que su vida no estaba completa porque no esquiaba. De manera que lo llevó a esquiar una noche después de una tormenta heladora y le dijo:

Tom pasó la noche en el hospital y 2 meses con muletas. Se acordó de Norm siempre que le fallaba la rodilla y se caía en la calle.
Entonces vivía en un edificio de apartamentos de alquiler. Si un apartamento necesitaba un repitando, el arrendador proporcionaba la pintura pero no la mano de obra. Tom puso un cartel en el que se ofrecía a pintar por 50 USD la habitación. Así subsistió unos meses.[28]​
El International Marketing Institute le contrató para ir 2 meses para impartir un curso de desarrollo ejecutivo en Arabia Saudí. Siguió trabajando para el IMI durante varios años en países lejanos como Kuala Lumpur.[28]​
Tom inventó el taller de reparaciones para aficionados en el que alquilaba espacio y herramientas, que puso en marcha en 1973 junto con su hermano Ray.[23]​
Además del programa de radio local Tom trabajaba un día o dos a la semana en la consultora Technology Consulting Group, dirigida por un antiguo compañero del MIT, Mike Brose, e impartió clases en las universidades locales.[28]​
Además de trabajar en el taller, la consultora e impartir clases, se apuntó como estudiante de doctorado en la Universidad de Boston y tardó 9 años en sacar su doctorado en Marquetin de la Boston University School of Management.[29]​[28]​
Mientras trabajaba en la radio conoció a su segunda esposa, Joanna.[28]​
Tom decidió abandonar la docencia.[30]​

Dimitió y el decano le pidió que se quedara. Se quedó y luego volvió a dimitir para siempre después de 8 años de docente como doctor.[28]​
Tuvo un descapotable Dodge Dart de 1963 que fue declarado siniestro total tras un accidente.
El 3 de noviembre de 2014 Tom murió a los 77 años en Belmont, Massachusetts,[31]​ debido a complicaciones de la enfermedad de Alzheimer.[23]​
En noviembre de 2014, en el programa 1445 Ray recopiló una serie de momentos hilarantes del programa Car Talk como homenaje a su hermano Tom.[32]​


=== Ray Magliozzi ===
Ray Magliozzi nació en Cambridge, Massachusetts y pasó sus primeros años en East Cambridge. Su madre no le dejaba ver la televisión y lo mandaba a la cama a las 19:00. Su abuela vivía con ellos y cuando lo llevaba de compras lo hacía cantar y bailar delante de sus amigas. A Ray siempre le gustó desmontar cosas y volverlas a montar una y otra vez. Vivía junto al Museo de la Ciencia y su padre le solía llevar los domingos. Asistió a la Gannett School durante 7 años.[33]​
Más tarde asistió al MIT. Dentro de sus estudios se unió a VISTA (the Volunteers in Service to America program) y pasó un año en Texas dando clases para adultos y organización comunitaria. Allí conoció a su esposa Monique con quien se casó al volver a Cambridge para seguir estudiando en el MIT otros 2 años. Se graduó en Ciencias y Humanidades en 1972 y comenzó a dar clases de ciencias en Bennington, Vermont. Allí no se encontraba a gusto debido al frío y a la acogida de los lugareños.[33]​ En 1973 volvió a Cambridge y junto a su hermano Tom montó el taller de reparación de coches del tipo hágaselo usted mismo llamado Hacker's Haven.[34]​[35]​
El taller alquilaba herramientas y espacio a automovilistas para que arreglaran sus vehículos. Su anuncio era:

[36]​
El taller no era rentable y perdieron dinero, pero sin embargo, los dos disfrutaron la experiencia y se hicieron conocidos por su negocio innovador y diferente a lo habitual.[28]​
En 1977 fueron invitados a participar en Boston en un panel de expertos en automoción en la emisora WBUR-FM, afiliada a la National Public Radio.[23]​ Posteriormente convirtieron el taller en un taller de coches normal llamado Good News Garage.[37]​[22]​
Ray pasó años acudiendo al taller a las 08:00 para trabajar junto a 4 empleados. Además participó en el programa semanal de Car Talk, hizo pruebas de coches nuevos y escribió en la web de Car Talk.[33]​
Ray tiene dos hijos: Louie y Andrew.[33]​

== Ubicación ==
Los Magliozzis tenían un taller y cerca estaban los estudios de grabación del programa en la esquina de JFK Street y Brattle Street en Harvard Square, rotuladas como Dewey, Cheatem & Howe, la firma de abogados ficticia a la que se referían en sus programas. DC&H se convirtió en el nombre del negocio de Tappet Brothers Associates, la empresa establecida para gestionar el negocio de Car Talk. El nombre iniciado como una broma se estableció legalmente como empresa cuando Car Talk se comenzó a emitir a nivel nacional por la NPR.


== Honores ==
En 1999 conjuntamente los dos hermanos dieron el discurso de la ceremonia de graduación del MIT.[46]​


== Adaptaciones ==
El programa de radio fue la inspiración para el programa de televisión The George Wendt Show, que se emitió en la temporada 1994-1995.[47]​
En julio de 2007 la televisión pública PBS anunció que emitiría en 2008 una adaptación animada de Car Talk titulada Click and Clack's As the Wrench Turns.[48]​ Se basaba en los hermanos Click y Clack, que tenían un taller en Car Talk Plaza. Se emitieron 10 episodios entre julio y agosto de 2008.[49]​
El musical Car Talk: The Musical!!! fue escrito y dirigido por Wesley Savick, y compuesto por Michael Wartofsky. La adaptación fue presentada por la universidad de Suffolk y debutó el 31 de marzo de 2011 en el Modern Theatre de Boston, Massachusetts.[50]​
La obra no estaba respaldada oficialmente por los Magliozzis, pero participaron en la producción, prestando sus voces a una marioneta llamada The Wizard of Cahs.[51]​

428,"El bocadillo de chorizo, a veces llamado sándwich de chorizo, es un tipo de bocadillo que en el interior posee diversos tipos de cortes de chorizo, por regla general en forma de lonchas.[1]​ Puede servirse con diferentes variedades de chorizo. A veces es un bocadillo que se sirve caliente si el chorizo se asa o fríe previamente, o puede servirse frío (en este caso el chorizo es curado). Es un alimento que combina dos ingredientes de bajo coste: pan y chorizo. Según algunos estudios es el bocadillo preferido de aproximadamente el 3% de los españoles.[2]​ La sencillez de elaboración hace que se haya extendido por diversos países donde el pan y el chorizo forman parte de la culinaria típica del país.


== Características ==
Las preparaciones de bocadillo de chorizo existentes pasan por variaciones en el tipo de pan empleado, así como del tipo del chorizo. De esta forma se tiene que:
Cuando el tipo de chorizo empleado es fresco, suele untarse o bien cocinarse previamente, ya sea a la plancha, asado en la sartén, a la parrilla, cocido, etcétera, tras lo cual se introduce en el pan, entero o cortado longitudinalmente. Si es curado se corta en lonchas de uno o dos milímetros de grosor.
Sobre el pan empleado para su realización es generalizado el uso de pan francés en diversas variantes. Es frecuente encontrar cruasanes y brioches (medianoches). El tamaño del bocadillo suele oscilar entre los diez y hasta los cuarenta centímetros de longitud. En localidades como Villarcayo de Merindad de Castilla la Vieja se elabora con pan en forma de rosca.[1]​
En la gastronomía de España existen algunas variantes del bocadillo de chorizo. Suelen emplearse variedades como el chorizo de Cantimpalos, Villarcayo, Pamplona o cular.[3]​ Una de las variantes más populares en Asturias es el bollo preñao, que consiste en un pan elaborado con un chorizo en el interior de su masa. En algunas zonas del País Vasco y Navarra también suelen tomarse bocadillos de chistorra y chorizo de Pamplona, mientras que en algunos lugares de Castilla es costumbre elaborar bocadillos de morcón ibérico. El pan empleado puede ir desde una simple chapata a una baguette o incluso un cruasán. Se suele servir como merienda de niños (suele untarse en algunas ocasiones con mantequilla), aunque es frecuente verlo en bares y puestos al aire libre en las reuniones públicas.

430,"Liane Cartman (nacida el 12 de febrero de 1961) es una personaje ficticia de la serie animada estadounidense South Park, creada por Trey Parker y Matt Stone e interpretado en inglés por Bergman, Schneider y Stewart. Habita en el pueblo ficticio de South Park, Colorado, en Estados Unidos. Liane es la madre de Eric Cartman y es una de los adultos más irresponsables del pueblo. Inicialmente se dijo que era hermafrodita, es decir, que tiene los genitales masculino y femenino y en el episodio donde se descubre tal cualidad, se determinó que era biológicamente el padre de Eric. Sin embargo eso no fue más que un encubrimiento para tapar al verdadero padre de Eric, quien resultó ser un ex jugador de los Broncos de Denver, pero Eric lo mató y se lo dio de comer a uno de sus enemigos, quien resultó ser su medio hermano. Liane es una mujer muy promiscua, quien se puede acostar hasta con cualquier extraño, con una sola persona o con un equipo de fútbol completo. Aparentemente trabaja como prostituta, aunque Cartman lo niega, también ha aparecido en las portadas de revistas pornográficas y en videos en Internet teniendo actos de coprofilia con alemanes. Es excesivamente consentidora con su hijo y muy tolerante con las acciones anormales de Cartman. Es la única delgada de su familia ya que sus hermanos y padres son todos obesos como Eric, y quien comparte su mismo humor y actitudes. El nombre de Liane proviene de la ex-novia de Trey Parker, quien se llamaba Liane Adamo, la cual le fue infiel a él.

431,"El Hombre de Croghan, es el cadáver de un hombre momificado, que vivió aproximadamente en los años 362 a. C. al 175 a. C., en la Edad de Hierro.


== Descubrimiento ==
El cuerpo fue descubierto en junio del año 2003, por un trabajador irlandés, Kevin Barry, en una turbera pantanosa, cerca del volcán inactivo de Croghan Hill, al norte de Daingean, pertenciente al condado de Offaly, en Irlanda y se da la casualidad que a solo 40 kilómetros del lugar se halló el cuerpo del Hombre de Clonycavan.


== Características ==
Momificación natural
Causa de la muerte: fue torturado y apuñalado en el pecho, en lo que podía considerarse como un sacrificio ritual, se intentó defender de la agresión como se deduce del corte hallado en uno de sus brazos.
Edad: 20 años aproximadamente.
Altura: medía 1,98 m.
El cuerpo apareció totalmente desnudo y con trozos de avellano entre los brazos.
sufría pleuritis.
Su dieta estaba basada en leche, cereales y carne.


== Conservación ==
El Hombre de Croghan, se encontró en buen estado de conservación debido a la protección natural que le otorgó el haber quedado enterrado dentro de una turbera, aunque le faltaban la cabeza y las extremidades inferiores, sus uñas y manos estaban muy bien cuidadas por lo que se cree que se trataba de un miembro de alto rango en su comunidad.
El cuerpo se encuentra expuesto en el Museo Nacional de Irlanda en Dublín.

432,"Luis Alberto Francisco Landaburu (n. Ramos Mejía, Buenos Aires, Argentina; 22 de septiembre de 1953). Es un exfutbolista argentino. Jugaba de arquero y se retiró en Lutgardis Riveros Gigena de la provincia de Córdoba.


== Trayectoria ==
Landaburu fue un arquero de excelente nivel al que le tocó ser suplente de Ubaldo Fillol en River Plate entre 1975 y 1980. Pedido en esos años por diversos clubes, Ángel Labruna se negó siempre a venderlo porque lo consideraba, después de Fillol, el mejor arquero del fútbol argentino. En 1970 tuvo un breve paso por Defensores de Belgrano. En 1981 fue transferido a Vélez Sarsfield. En 1982 fue contratado por Estudiantes (Río Cuarto) proveniente del Tampico Madero de Méxicoque se había ido al descenso ese año y no los pudo retener. Llegó a Colombia al Cúcuta como primer destino, Bucaramanga de Colombia fue su próximo destino y una seria lesión sufrida en ese país lo hizo dudar sobre su futuro. Regresó a su primer club, Estudiantes de Caseros, para jugar en la Primera B (fue el mejor arquero de la temporada 86/87). En 1992 estuvo en Lutgardis Riveros.
Posee experiencia como formador de arqueros de divisiones inferiores, ya que por sus manos pasaron guardavallas como Roberto Bonano, Joaquín Irigoytía, Germán Lux y Franco Costanzo. Entre el 2002 y el 2004 se desempeñó como entrenador de arqueros en el club Nueva Chicago, en el 2005 volvió a River Plate para trabajar en las inferiores y como entrenador de arqueros, cumpliendo en estos últimos meses una prolífica labor al frente de la divisiones inferiores del Huracán. Como director técnico cuenta con la experiencia de haber dirigido la 3.ª división de Vélez Sarsfield y el selectivo sub 17 de River Plate, con el que alcanzó un subcampeonato mundial de clubes en Italia. A principios de 2012, fue ayudante de campo de Mario Finarolli en el Club Almagro de la Primera B. En el año 2015 regresó al Club Atlético Estudiantes para desempeñarse como entrenador de arqueros en las divisiones inferiores.

435,"Valentín Tornos López (n. Madrid; 4 de enero de 1901 - f. 19 de septiembre de 1976) fue un actor español.


== Biografía ==
Tras finalizar sus estudios de primaria, comenzó a trabajar como auxiliar de juzgados y secretario de notarías. Su debut teatral se produjo en 1920, con la compañía de Antonia Plana y Emilio Díaz. Desde entonces consagra su trayectoria profesional al teatro, casi siempre en papeles secundarios, y con los que consigue una popularidad muy discreta. Especializado en comedia, interpreta obras de Carlos Arniches, Pedro Muñoz Seca o los Hermanos Álvarez Quintero.
A principios de los años veinte se integra en la compañía de Loreto Prado y Enrique Chicote, donde conoce a la que sería su esposa durante 45 años, Consuelo Cisneros, con la que contrae matrimonio en 1922. Tras pasar por el Teatro de la Comedia (1931-1936). Finalizada la Guerra Civil Española, continuaría su carrera teatral junto a cómicos como Manolo Gómez Bur y Zori, Santos y Codeso.
En cine debutó tarde, a la edad de 58 años, con La Copla Andaluza (1959) y rodó más de cuarenta películas, siempre en papeles secundarios. De su trayectoria cinematográfica, se pueden destacar títulos como La Gran Familia (1962) de Fernando Palacios, El grano de mostaza (1962) de José Luis Sáenz de Heredia, La verbena de la Paloma (1963) de José Luis Sáenz de Heredia, El Verdugo (1963) de Luis García Berlanga, Más bonita que ninguna (1965) de Luis César Amadori, La ciudad no es para mí (1966) de Pedro Lazaga, Historias de la televisión (1965) de José Luis Sáenz de Heredia, La Busca (1967) de Angelino Fons, El turismo es un gran invento (1968) de Pedro Lazaga, El bosque del lobo (1971) de Pedro Olea o La semana del asesino (1972) de Eloy de la Iglesia.
Presente en Televisión Española desde los primeros tiempos del Paseo de La Habana, su debut en el medio se remonta a 1961 en una adaptación de Don Quijote realizada por Domingo Almendros. Durante la década de los años 60 participó en cerca de setenta espacios dramáticos como Primera fila, Estudio 1, Novela, Teatro de familia o Teatro de humor.
Pese a su extensa trayectoria su gran popularidad le llega en los últimos años de su vida. Había coincidido con Chicho Ibáñez Serrador en alguno de los episodios de Historias para no dormir. Cuando en 1972 el director puso en marcha su famosísimo concurso Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez Ibañez Serrador se acordó de Tornos para interpretar el papel de Don Cicuta, un viejo cascarrabias, procedente del imaginario pueblo de Tacañón del Todo, ataviado con un oscuro traje de enterrador decimonónico, y que encarna lo peor de una España profunda y gris que empezaba a superarse en aquellos años: Don Cicuta es avaro, pedante y puritano. La pretensión del personaje no era otra que caricaturizar la censura todavía presente en aquellos últimos años de la dictadura franquista.
El personaje convirtió a Valentín Tornos en un auténtico fenómeno sociológico: fue portada de periódicos y revistas, se fabricaron muñecos, juegos de mesa, llaveros, cromos y todo tipo de piezas de mercadería con su imagen, grabó un disco, y consiguió el Premio TP de Oro de 1972 al Personaje Más Popular.
Finalizada la primera etapa del programa, en 1973, el estado de salud de Valentín Tornos, se fue deteriorando y únicamente intervino en un par de películas más: Don Quijote cabalga de nuevo (1973) y Las Correrías del Vizconde de Arnau (1974).
Al comenzar la segunda etapa de Un, dos, tres, el 19 de marzo de 1976, Valentín Tornos, postrado en una silla de ruedas a causa de una trombosis cerebral, no pudo asumir de nuevo el papel que le había convertido en una auténtica celebridad en España. Sólo intervino en aquel programa para anunciar la llegada de sus sustitutos procedentes de Tacañón del Todo: el Profesor Lápiz, Don Rácano y Don Estrecho, interpretados respectivamente por Pedro Sempson, Francisco Cecilio y Juan Tamariz.
Valentín Tornos fallecería seis meses después en su domicilio de la calle Camarena, en el madrileño barrio de Aluche.

436,"Miguel Mariano Gómez y Arias (1889-1950) fue un político cubano, fue presidente de la República de Cuba durante siete meses en 1936, hijo del también presidente José Miguel Gómez (1909-1913).
En 1926 fue elegido Alcalde de La Habana, hizo oposición a la dictadura del General Gerardo Machado hasta que tuvo que partir al exilio en Nueva York. Regresó a Cuba en 1933 después de la caída de Machado y tres años después, en 1936, fue electo presidente de la República, cargo en el que duró apenas siete meses, tras lo cual fue destituido.
Miguel Mariano Gómez fue el primer presidente de la república electo por el voto popular después del fin del gobierno dictatorial de Gerardo Machado el 12 de agosto de 1933 y tras los gobiernos provisonales de Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada (1933), Ramón Grau San Martín (1933-1934), Carlos Mendieta (1934-1935) y José A. Barnet (1935-1936).


== Gobierno ==
Con el prestigio ganado durante su administración como alcalde de La Habana, en donde realizó importantes obras como fueron el ""Hospital de Maternidad"", el ""Hospital Infantil"", y la ""Escuela José Miguel Gómez"", entre otras, inició su gobierno con la publicación de un vasto programa, el cual abarcaba una multitud de medidas de carácter económico, social, cultural y político.
No obstante el extenso programa de mejoras de su gobierno, no logró contar con un fuerte apoyo de la opinión pública y tuvo desde casi el primer momento una fuerte oposición política, sin que pudiese contar en el congreso con una mayoría que le permitiese realizar su programa, situación que se agravó al perder el apoyo de una parte de los elementos políticos que habían contribuido a su elección.
Formándose una fuerte oposición dentro del congreso, se formularon contra él acusaciones de carácter político, de interferir con la facultades del poder legislativo, a virtud de lo cual el congreso acordó su destitución el 24 de diciembre de 1936.
Fallece en La Habana en 1950.

444,"Eritrean Airlines (IATA: B8, OACI: ERT) es una aerolínea cuya base principal está en Asmara (Eritrea).

Es íntegramente propiedad del gobierno de Eritrea y opera servicios a Europa, África y el Oriente Medio, con planes para expandir tanto su flota como su red de destinos. Su principal base de operaciones el Aeropuerto Internacional de Asmara (ASM).


== Historia ==
La aerolínea fue establecida en 1991, pero sólo su denominación, sirviendo como agente de manejo en tierra de aeronaves en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Asmara, y los aeropuertos de Assab y Massawa; y como agente de ventas de otras importantes compañías que volaban a Eritrea. En mayo de 2002 se dedidió expandir a los servicios de aerolínea. Eritrean Airlines recibió su primera aeronave, un Boeing 767-300ER alquilado en abril de 2003, iniciando sus servicios a Ámsterdam, Fráncfort, Milán, Nairobi y Roma. Un segundo Boeing 767 fue adquirido a mediados de 2004.
Durante el 2005 Eritrean Airlines empezó a volar desde Asmara a Yibuti y Dubái, a la vez que los servicios a Nairobi fueron suspendidos. Una tercera aeronave, un Airbus 320 fue adquirido en el 2006 y los vuelos a Ámsterdam y Milán fueron terminados.
El 21 de septiembre de 2006 Eritrean Airlines firmó un acuerdo con el Gobierno de Pakistán para iniciar vuelos directos entre Eritrea y Pakistán. Eritrean Airlines recibió el permiso de la autoridad de aviación civil de Pakistán para realizar dos vuelos semanales, una a Karachi y el otro a Lahore.[1]​
El acuerdo no parece haberse materializado desde entonces, ya que ninguna de las aerolíneas han agregado destinos de la otra parte a su listado de destinos. Para la temporada invernal 2006/2007 y la temporada de verano de 2007, los destinos a ser servidos son los siguientes: dos vuelos semanales a Jedda, Roma, Fráncfort y Dubai vía Yibuti.


== Destinos ==

Eritrean Airlines opera a los siguientes destinos en julio de 2011:
Egipto
Cairo - Aeropuerto Internacional de El Cairo

Eritrea
Asmara - Aeropuerto Internacional de Asmara Hub
Massawa - Aeropuerto Internacional de Massawa

[2]​ A 12 de octubre de 2011 la aerolínea planea iniciar vuelos a Karachi via Dubai, la aerolínea ya opera vuelos a Pakistan (Lahore) via Dubai pero se cree que la aerolínea optará por modificar la ruta en lugar de añadir un nuevo vuelo. Habrá también tres vuelos semanales a El Cairo que en la actualidad es servido via Jartoum y doblará la capacidad a Egipto con seis vuelos semanales en lugar de los tres actuales. LA aerolínea también añadirá un cuarto vuelo en la ruta Asmara - Jeddah este invierno, mientras que su única ruta europea con destino Roma será servido con un único vuelo semanal directo en lugar de los dos vuelos semanales con parada en El Cairo como hasta ahora.

445,"Jean Jaurès, cuyo nombre completo era Auguste Marie Joseph Jean Léon Jaurès (Castres, Francia, 3 de septiembre de 1859-París, 31 de julio de 1914),[1]​ fue un político socialista francés. Fundó L'Humanité en 1904. Fue asesinado tres días después de comenzada la Primera Guerra Mundial.[2]​


== Biografía ==
Jean Jaurès nació en Castres en 1859, en el seno de una familia de la pequeña burguesía asentada en el departamento de Tarn. Era hijo de Jules Jaurès (1819-1882) y Adélaïde Barbaza y Salvaire (1822-1906), y primo de André Louis Georges Marie Salvaire, mentor de la Basílica Nacional de Nuestra Señora de Luján, en Argentina. Jaurès obtuvo el número uno en el acceso a la Escuela Normal Superior de la calle de Ulm en 1878 y el número tres en la oposición a la cátedra de filosofía en 1881. Ejerció como profesor en primer lugar en Albi y más adelante en Toulouse, en 1882, en cuya Facultad de Letras ejerció su cátedra de maestro de conferencias.[3]​


=== Político ===
Tras la consolidación de la República, que seguía al decenio de fluctuaciones y en la que la Cámara de Diputados había estado dominada por los monárquicos divididos tras el derrumbamiento del Segundo Imperio en 1870, Jaurès tenía sólo veinte años. Entró en política y fue elegido diputado republicano por el departamento de Tarn en 1885. Se alineó con los «herederos» de Jules Ferry y entre los «oportunistas», republicanos socialmente moderados.
Para él, por aquella época, los «radicales» que encabezaba Clemenceau eran demasiado exigentes, y los socialistas violentos y peligrosos para el orden republicano que se estaba reconstruyendo. No es que no se interesase por la clase obrera. Puso su mítica elocuencia a disposición de las primeras leyes sociales del régimen (libertad sindical, protección de los delegados, creación de planes de jubilación para los obreros...). Heredero del espíritu de 1789, era sin embargo un firme partidario del reformismo institucional y republicano, de la alianza entre obreros y pequeña burguesía por el triunfo de la libertad, de la igualdad y de la fraternidad.
En 1889 los republicanos ganaron en las legislativas, pero él, el republicano que propugnaba el control del estado sobre las empresas, fue derrotado en su circunscripción de Tarn por el marqués de Solages, presidente de las minas. Siendo profesor en Toulouse llevó a cabo una tesis doctoral sobre los orígenes del pensamiento socialista alemán, que acentuaron su vocación social, y se presentó en las listas municipales por Tolosa.


=== La huelga de Carmaux ===

Jaurès vivía distanciado de la vida política nacional cuando estalló en 1892 la gran huelga de las minas de Carmaux. El alcalde electo, Jean Baptiste Calvignac, minero sindicalista y socialista, fue despedido por el marqués de Solages con la excusa de que había faltado a su trabajo para cubrir sus necesidades de representante municipal. Los obreros se pusieron en huelga para defender a aquel alcalde del que se sentían orgullosos. La República envió al ejército, 1500 soldados, en nombre del «derecho al trabajo». Parece que la República se puso de parte de la patronal monárquica contra los huelguistas. Francia estaba sumida en el escándalo de Panamá. Jaurès ya no era capaz de sentirse identificado con una República que parece ser que mostraba su auténtica cara en la que diputados y ministros capitalistas primaban a las finanzas y a la industria sobre el respeto a las personas; Carmaux y la mina serán el trampolín político que buscaba. Llevó a cabo el aprendizaje de la lucha de clases y del socialismo. En una huelga a la que entró como intelectual burgués republicano social salió como socialista convencido.


=== Diputado socialista ===
Bajo la presión de la huelga y de Jaurès, el gobierno arbitró el pleito entre Solages y Calvignac en favor de este último. Solages dimitió de su escaño de diputado. De modo lógico, los obreros de la cuenca minera designaron diputado a Jaurès; ya no será un obrero, sino un burgués el líder de los mineros. La oposición del voto rural no impidió su elección. Jaurès se consagró a la defensa continua y resuelta de los obreros en lucha. En Albi estuvo entre los que participaron en la famosa «vidriería obrera». En el Languedoc vitícola visitó a los vendimiadores libres de Maraussan, que crearon la primera bodega cooperativa.
Al principio del caso Dreyfus, Jaurès no tomó partido con claridad. Sin embargo, como consecuencia de la presión popular, y también gracias al fervor de las jóvenes promociones de las Escuelas Normales, Jaurès y los socialistas tomaron partido claramente por Alfred Dreyfus.
Se opuso por esa época a los marxistas ortodoxos, cuyo líder era Jules Guesde y para quien Dreyfus era un oficial burgués, por lo que su defensa no se estimaba prioritaria. Para Jaurès, el cúmulo de desgracias e injusticias de las que Dreyfus fue víctima borró las diferencias de clase. La cuestión no era si Dreyfus era un privilegiado o un explotador; era un hombre que sufría injustamente y los socialistas debían oponerse a cualquier injusticia. Jaurès fundó el periódico L'Humanité en 1904.
En 1905 participó en la fundación de la SFIO, que unificó, bajo presión de la Internacional, las distintas tendencias socialistas de Francia. A pesar de que reconocía la lucha de clases, para Jaurès, sólo hay una humanidad, y el hombre de izquierdas debía implicarse por la República en una revolución democrática y no violenta. Se opuso al colonialismo y se enfrentó a la intervención francesa en Marruecos.
En 1911 escribió abogando por la enseñanza en las escuelas del occitano, el bretón y el euskera.


=== Internacionalista pacifista ===

Combatía el peligro de la guerra europea con pasión, especialmente tras el estallido de las Guerras Balcánicas en 1912-1913. Se opuso a la ley que alargó a tres años el servicio militar obligatorio. Ante el ultimátum austríaco contra Serbia, tras el asesinato del Archiduque Francisco Fernando en Sarajevo, Jaurès se distanció de la ola chauvinista que crecía y en su discurso en Lyon, el 23 de julio de 1914, culpó de la «situación terrible» a «la política colonial de Francia, la política hipócrita de Rusia y la brutal voluntad de Austria». Llamó a los obreros de todos los países que estaban al borde de enfrentarse en la guerra a unirse para alejar «la horrible pesadilla».

Su toma de postura en pro del pacifismo, poco antes del desencadenamiento de la Primera Guerra Mundial, lo hicieron impopular entre los sectores nacionalistas, y Raoul Villain, un joven de ideas ultrapatrióticas, lo asesinó en el Café du Croissant de la calle Montmartre de París, una semana después de su discurso y tres días después de que se iniciaran las hostilidades.[2]​ Villain fue liberado el 29 de marzo de 1919.
Al finalizar la I Guerra Mundial, y como reacción a la masacre que ocasionó, muchos municipios franceses colocaron a calles y plazas su nombre, recordando su papel de firme opositor a dicho conflicto. También el Metro de París y el Metro de Lyon y el de Toulouse pusieron su nombre a una de sus estaciones.

446,"Freiherr Adolph Franz Friedrich Ludwig Knigge (Bredenbeck, 16 de octubre de 1752 - Bremen, 6 de mayo de 1796) fue un escritor alemán masón y miembro de los Iluminados de Baviera. Se unió a la francmasonería con el objetivo de promover los derechos humanos. Su libro De cómo tratar con las personas está considerado como un emblema del pensamiento ilustrado.[1]​ 


== Biografía ==
Knigge nació en Bredenbeck (ahora parte de Wennigsen, Baja Sajonia) en el electorado de Hannover, como miembro de la pequeña nobleza. Estudió Derecho en Gotinga, donde se hizo miembro del Cuerpo de Hannover. Su familia se arruinó y Knigge se vio obligado a trabajar.
Entró en la Corte de Federico II, que abandonó tras múltiples malentendidos.[1]​
Desde muy joven entró en contacto con la masonería. Al parecer, fue iniciado como masón en el rito templario en la ciudad de Kassel, donde ocupó una posición en el tribunal, asesor de guerra y ministro de Hacienda. En 1777 se convirtió en chamberlain en la Corte de Weimar.
Se unió a otro joven, Adam Weishaupt, para crear en Baviera el rito de la orden secreta de los Iluminados, con la que abogó por la promoción de los derechos humanos en Alemania. La influencia de Knigge sobre la orden fue de gran importancia, ya que sus relaciones personales contribuyeron en gran medida a su propagación. Pero en 1783 surgieron diferencias entre ambos, provocando la retirada definitiva de Knigge el 1 de julio de 1784, después de que no le resultara favorable el resultado de un congreso convocado ad hoc para resolver sus diferencias.
Tras un periodo de grave enfermedad perdió el apoyo de sus patrocinadores aristócratas y gran parte de su fortuna. Al final de su vida defendió la Revolución Francesa y acusado de jacobinismo fue obligado a vivir por un tiempo bajo vigilancia policial.
En 1790 recuperó su dinero y se instaló en Bremen donde murió en 1796.


=== De cómo tratar con las personas ===

De sus experiencias vitales y el contacto con la ciudadanía de diferentes clases sociales y su capacidad para observar los detalles más reveladores surge el tratado De cómo tratar a las personas[2]​ (Über den Umgang mit Menschen) que publica en 1788 en el que además de aconsejar a sus coetáneos -consideran los historiadores- radiografía el espíritu de su tiempo y se mantiene como una obra contemporánea.
Knigge defiende que las mentes más ingeniosas y brillantes pueden desempeñar un papel ""lamentable"" en la vida social si no entienden algunos códigos, normas no escritas de buena conducta. Así hay personas de grandes cualidades que creen que, por el hecho de tenerlas, están ""autorizadas"" a descuidar las convenciones. También destaca la necesidad de cuidar especialmente a los amigos por ser lo más valioso y critica en un capítulo dedicado al trato con artistas y académicos el denigrante espectáculo que se observa a veces entre sabios que se pelean en público como mendigos.[1]​
El trabajo es más un tratado sociológico y filosófico sobre las bases de las relaciones humanas que una guía sobre la etiqueta. El término alemán ""Knigge"" ha venido a significar ""buenos modales"".


==== Sobre el trato con uno mismo ====
El autor distingue los temperamentos colérico, flemático, sanguíneo o melancólico. Reconoce que lo mejor es poder mezclar las diferentes disposiciones de ánimo y considera que los sanguíneo-flemáticos son los que viven más felices porque no abusan de sus fuerzas pero tampoco logran nada importante.


==== Del trato entre personas de distinta edad ====
Alerta de los prejuicios del abismo generacional y considera que no es bueno que se produzca una separación entre las personas de edades diferentes. Recomienda que los hombres no se burlen de los niños y que de ellos aprendan las virtudes de la benevolencia, la lealtad y la sinceridad.


==== Del trato entre cónyuges ====
Considera que no debe perderse nunca la cortesía en la intimidad y que hay que intentar no aburrir al otro con las mismas anécdotas de siempre. Considera que debe tenerse máxima precaución en el trato y esforzarse por vigilarse a sí mismo, empezando por no descuidar la higiene del cuerpo. El tratado escrito en el siglo XVIII no escapa a la desigualdad en las relaciones que actualmente, según los historiadores, podrían considerarse como actitudes machistas como la recomendación de ""pequeñas ausencias de viaje y negocios"" para oxigenar la relación. A la vuelta, afirma, la fiel esposa le esperará anhelante. Igualmente -dice- deberemos ser cautos con las mujeres coquetas que se dedican a jugar con los sentimientos de un hombre honesto.[1]​


==== Sobre el trato con las mujeres ====
El escritor pide que no se le considere en ningún caso un difamador del sexo femenino. Asegura que las mujeres le han enseñado tolerancia y amor pero que cada sexo, clase, carácter posee sus flaquezas y él lo que hace es describirlas. Lo más importante para gustar a las mujeres, cree Knigge es mostrar una capa de ternura que no puede confundirse con una debilidad afeminada. Y recomienda a los hombres: dominar el lenguaje de la mirada sin llegar al flirteo descarado, ser modestos sin ser tímidos, valientes sin ser tempestuosos y románticos sin caer en extravagancias.[1]​


==== Sobre el modo de tratar a los animales ====
Critica a las personas que encierran a seres vivos en jaulas. Sostiene que ninguna criatura puede tener el derecho a jugar con la vida de otra criatura a la que Dios ha insuflado su hálito. Defiende a cazadores y carniceros pero ataca a quienes torturan por el mero hecho de ver satisfecha su crueldad.


== Knigge y los Iluminados de Baviera ==

El sobrenombre de Knigge dentro de los Illuminati era Philón, en honor a un arquitecto ateniense del siglo IV.
Knigge intentó ingresar en la Orden de Rosacruz pero no lo logró y se convirtió en enemigo acérrimo de dicha sociedad.
Una vez miembro de la masonería que ésta era escenario de muchos conflictos internos, motivo por el cual se dispuso a realizar una reforma masónica cuyo proyecto no fue aprobado por las logias alemanas. Poco tiempo después creó junto con Adam Weishaupt el rito Illuminati, en el cual veía plasmado su proyecto de reforma. Weishaupt confesó que durante la creación del rito junto con Knigge, no podía más que reír ante la manera en la que planearon la estrategia de conseguir adeptos para la orden.
El autor Le Forestier asegura que Knigge dijo: “El respeto que la orden manifestaba al cristianismo en algunos de sus grados era únicamente un engaño para despejar las sospechas de quien aún tenía fe y conducirlo con mayor suavidad a abandonarla"".
Al final de su vida, sin embargo, a pesar de haber sido uno de sus miembros más destacados, en su tratado de 1788 De cómo tratar a las personas califica a las sociedades secretas como un disparate y una moda estúpida.[1]​

448,"La inmigración árabe en Chile se dio de forma espontánea, estimulada por presiones de orden, político y religioso, acompañada también de cierto espíritu aventurero. La gran mayoría de los inmigrantes musulmanes provinieron de Oriente Medio y en la actualidad la colonia del pueblo árabe se consagra como la más grande e influyente de asiáticos en el país.[4]​


== Historia ==

Los primeros árabes registrados en un censo se remontan al realizado en 1895, las primeras comunidades que emigraron a Chile eran de grandes riquezas, como las familias Arbuch, Basbus, Nadurie, Hachui, Gidi, Abraham, sin embargo en 1854 y 1884 aparecen algunos súbditos del Califato Otomano, los que bien podrían ser del Líbano, Palestina o Siria, que formaban parte del Imperio en ese entonces.
La mayoría de los palestinos llegaron a principios del siglo XX, escapando del Califato Otomano debido principalmente a que profesaban la religión cristiana, la dominación opresiva y acompañada también de cierto espíritu aventurero y el estallido de la primera guerra mundial. Cabe señalar que la opresión turca otomana (sunnitas) no sólo se vio reflejada en la minoría cristiana de Siria, Palestina y Líbano, sino que también en contra de los musulmanes shiitas que arribaron a toda la costa atlántica siendo mayoría en la región y que algunos pasaron via Argentina a Chile a comienzos del 1900 localizándose a lo largo del país aportando con su cultura y trabajo al desarrollo de Chile.
A su llegada, los árabes se dedicaron a trabajar principalmente en el sector comercial. La colectividad palestina, a pesar de sus diferencias culturales con la sociedad chilena, logró compenetrarse y formar parte importante de la clase media del país, aunque algunos de sus miembros ostentan algunas de las riquezas más grandes del país (familias Arbuch, Basbus, Nadurie, Hachui, Gidi Abraham) su residencia para ellos era principalmente en las condes. Aunque la mayoría de las otras familias árabes residieron en el Barrio Patronato, en Santiago y la ciudad de La Calera fueron sus principales centros de residencia, reunión y comercio por muchos años, en el último tiempo se han desplazado a lo largo de la ciudad de Chile y comunas de Santiago como, Las Condes, Providencia, Maipú, Recoleta y Ñuñoa.
En Beit Jala, tanto como en Beit Sahour o en Belén, se sabe más de Chile de lo que cualquier santiaguino común sabe de Medio Oriente. Porque todos allí tienen familia en este país, a 14 mil kilómetros de distancia. Primos lejanos, tíos en quinto grado, sobrinos y sobrinas de ultramar que cada vez que se dejan caer convulsionan la vida de sus parientes, más acostumbrados a los disparos y a los uniformes militares que a las visitas sorpresa. Todos forman una gran familia extendida que incluye a los palestinos-chilenos, aquéllos descendientes de los miles de Aziz, Ali, Jalil y Hannah que cambiaron las túnicas por el traje ""a la europea"" y se embarcaron rumbo a América desde 1860.
En la misma época en que 50 millones de almas escapaban de Europa al nuevo continente, y los países de este lado del Atlántico instalaban sus agencias de inmigración en Alemania y Francia, los palestinos se sumaban al gran desplazamiento humano. Se venían por las suyas. Nadie los invitaba, nadie los recibía. Hoy en Chile los descendientes de esa generación suman alrededor de 500 mil. No existe una cifra exacta, pero sí un récord que todos repiten: es la comunidad palestina más grande fuera del mundo árabe. A eso se debe que los obituarios del último tiempo de ""El Mercurio"" se repleten de nombres orientales. Son las víctimas de la incursión israelí a Jerusalén y Gaza con tantos deudos allá como en La Calera, Santiago o Curicó. La repercusión más triste de una inmigración que se encontró con dificultades que pocos quieren recordar, y que en menos de tres décadas pasó de los conventillos, la venta ambulante y la discriminación a la plena integración, y en más de algún caso, a las grandes fortunas.
El gran flujo migratorio árabe parte en 1860 y se extiende hasta 1900. Se calcula que los árabes que vinieron a América alcanzaron el millón de personas. Hasta 1918 los palestinos migraron con pasaporte turco. Los puertos de salida eran Beirut, Haifa y Alejandría; y el trayecto se hacía vía Génova y Marsella.
Hasta fines del siglo XIX, la población de Palestina bordeaba los 600 mil habitantes. En aquel entonces el número de judíos era de 35 mil. En 1931 había 1 millón de habitantes: 71 por ciento de musulmanes, 3 por ciento de judíos, 25 por ciento de cristianos y 1 % Druzos.
Las grandes concentraciones de emigrantes sirios, palestinos, libaneses y sus descendientes están en Brasil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela y Chile. Se estima que en América Latina sumarían 8 millones, de estos, 4,5 millones estarían en el Cono Sur.
En 1940 la Guía social de la Colonia Árabe en Chile : (Siria, Palestina, Libanesa), que puede ver en Memoria Chilena, estimaba en 13.466 el número de árabes en Chile.
El 61 % de los árabes llegados a Chile lo hizo entre 1900 y 1930. Más del 60 % de árabes que llegaban tenían entre 10 y 30 años.[5]​
En 1912 aparece Al Muerched, el primer periódico chileno escrito en árabe. Se calcula que existieron como mínimo 12 publicaciones del tipo durante los 40 años de inmigración.
Actualmente la inmigración árabe, especialmente palestina sigue siendo importante, aparte de la llegada de ellos por sus propios medios de Chile, en abril del año 2008 llegaron a suelo chileno 117 refugiados palestinos. Luego de una inmigración constante con el paso de los años, la colectividad palestina en Chile pasó a ser la más grande del mundo fuera del Medio Oriente, con alrededor de 500 mil miembros.[1] Además de la fuerte influencia y variada diversidad en ámbitos del quehacer nacional, un hecho que demuestra su gran presencia es la convocatoria de al menos 7 futbolistas chileno-palestinos (como Roberto Bishara) en la selección de fútbol de Palestina durante las clasificatorias asiáticas de la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2006. También se ve reflejada la influencia de esta comunidad en el deporte es en el Estadio Palestino y en el club de fútbol de Primera División Palestino.
De igual manera, existen en el país comunidades de origen sirio y el líbanes, aunque en una menor proporción respecto de los palestinos. Estas comunidades del Medio Oriente son en su mayoría árabes cristianos que profesan principalmente el catolicismo y en menor grado existen ciertos miembros de la Iglesia ortodoxa, el judaísmo y el Islam, presentando un incremento en su difusión a nivel académico y comunicacional e incluso en la conversión atraídos por la cultura árabe musulmana destacando por la cantidad de libros traducidos al castellano y difundidos por internet por la comunidad musulmana. Destaca recordar que los emigrantes sirios del área del Qalemun, situada entre Damasco y Hims, de los pueblos de An Nebek, Yabrud, Qaraa y Deir Atiyeh, fundaron las primeras entidades musulmanas en Argentina y Chile. En Chile se fundó la Sociedad Unión Musulmana en 1926, bajo el liderazgo de Tawfiq Rumie.
A diferencia de otras corrientes migratorias, la árabe tendió a la dispersión. Así, se encuentran en los más lejanos pueblos del país.


== Inicios de la vida en Chile ==
Los primeros inmigrantes se instalaron en Santiago en tres barrios: Recoleta, Independencia y Matucana.


=== Instituciones ===
Sus instituciones comunitarias más destacadas:
Club Deportivo Palestino. Fundado en 1920, juega en la primera división del fútbol chileno desde 1952 ha sido 2 veces campeón de este (`58 y `78), 2 veces campeón de la Copa Chile y Semifinalista de la Copa Libertadores, tiene el 3.º lugar en récord de invictos mundiales después del Celtic y la Juventus
Club Palestino. En 1938 se funda, su objetivo era un club social para la colectividad palestina de Santiago, se ubicó en la calle Santo Domingo, posteriormente adquirió un estadio en la Avenida Kennedy, es el estadio más grande de santiago tiene la piscina más honda de Chile, trampolín olímpico, piscina olímpica, dos gimnasios 20 canchas de tenis, un Court central, donde incluso Chile ha jugado la Copa Davis, 2 canchas profesionales de Fútbol, multicanchas techadas, pista de atletismo , cancha de Hockey patín, salones, entre muchas otras instalaciones. Posteriormente el club también fue trasladado al estadio.
El Club Palestino, llamado también popularmente Estadio Palestino, es un Club social y deportivo ubicado en la ciudad de Santiago en la comuna de Las Condes, en la Avenida Kennedy.
El Club surgió como el Club social del la Colectividad Palestina en Santiago ubicado en la calle Santo Domingo 673, fue fundado en 1938, el primer directorio fue presidido por don Nicolás Yarur, e integrado por los señores Placido Musalem, Salomón Ahues, Jacob Zaggmut, Saleh Yunis, Bishara Thumala, Emilio Deik, Guillermo Cumsille y Sabas Chahuan. Así el Club se fue transformando el punto de encuentro de la Colectividad Palestino-Árabe que crecía tanto en número como en importancia, grandes empresarios e impulsores de la industria en Chile eran inmigrantes o hijos de inmigrantes, como las familias, Sumar, Yarur, Nadurie, Hirmas, Gidi, Hasbun, Chahuan, Comandari, Arbuch entre otras.
Así el Club y las necesidades de la colectividad palestina fueron creciendo lo que significo que bajo la presidencia de Don Jorge Yarur Banna, más específicamente en 1955, la colectividad decidiera la construcción de un estadio, instalaciones deportivas, ya no solo era necesario un club social, si no la construcción de una piscina, canchas de tenis, futbol, entre otras, primero se pensó en un terreno en la intersección de Manquehue con Av. Las Condes, pero luego se adquirió el Fundo Chacra Suecia con 3,46 ha, hoy el Club Palestino, esto se financió mediante una seria de letras de cambio emitidas por el Banco de Crédito e Inversiones (BCI). Luego la Municipalidad de Las Condes Expropio 2,4 ha, quedando en la actualidad el club con 12,6 ha.
En el año 1965 se puso la primera piedra de la construcción de la nueva sede con la bendición de Monseñor José María Caro, Arzobispo de Santiago en ese entonces. Posteriormente en el año 1962 se comenzó con la Constructora Enrique Gidi y Cia, con el proyecto realizado por los arquitectos: Bolton, Larrain Prieto y Lira y el diseño de jardines fue realizado por un diseñador japonés. En el año 1968 tomó la presidencia de Club Palestino don Carlos Abu-Mohor Touma quien termino la construcción de la sede con una piscina olímpica y una piscina de niños.
El Club Palestino cuenta con diversos salones, Pista de Patinaje, el mayor centro de Tenis del País, un Gimnasio con cancha profesional de Basketball, canchas de squash, padle, 12 canchas de pasto sintético de futbolito y 3 canchas de pasto sintético de fútbol profesional, una cafetería, un Bar-restorán, juegos infantiles, un mini-golf, Las piscina más grande y profunda de Latinoamérica, un Curt Central de Tenis, donde incluso Chile ha hecho de local en Copa Davis.
La sede de Santo Domingo 673, fue vendida en la década de los 80´ cuando el Club Palestino se separó del Club Deportivo Palestino, Cuando Carlos Abu-Mohor presidía el Club Palestino y Ricardo Abu-Mohor presidía el Club Deportivo Palestino.


== Directorio Juvenil ==
En 1958 se conforma el primer Directorio Juvenil del Club Palestino, en la década de los 70´ luego de un congreso nacional palestino, bajo la presidencia de Eduardo Khamis surge El Festival de La Canción Palestina, llegando a transformarse en el segundo festival más importante de Chile, detrás del de Viña del Mar, tocando grupos de la importancia de Soda Stereo. su actual presidente es Diego Khamis.


== Organizaciones e instituciones árabes en Chile ==

== La colectividad palestina de la diáspora en Chile ==

Una de las principales colectividades en el país es la palestina. La mayoría de éstos palestinos llegaron a principios del siglo XX escapando del Imperio otomano, ya que eran principalmente de religión cristiana, dedicándose a trabajar en el sector comercial.
Los comienzos de la integración árabe en Chile fue bastante difícil, ya que la xenofobia a la cual se vieron afectados fue bastante importante, ya que se les consideró como inmigrantes de segunda clase, llenos de desvirtudes, que se desempeñaban en el sector económico más despreciado por la aristocracia chilena, el comercio ambulante. Los palestinos en Chile, a pesar de sus diferencias culturales con la sociedad chilena, lograron compenetrarse y formar parte importante de la clase media del país, aunque algunos de sus miembros ostentan algunas de las riquezas más grandes del país.
El barrio Patronato en Santiago, es destacado como el barrio árabe en donde viven y trabajan hasta hoy gran parte de los palestinos asentados en Chile, pero en cada rincón del país, hay un ""baisano"" (como se les llama cariñosamente). Las comunidades más destacadas son generalmente: Santiago, Talca, Viña del Mar, Valparaíso, La Calera, Quillota, Cabildo, Linares.
Un hecho que demuestra la importancia de la colonia palestina es la utilización de al menos 7 futbolistas chileno-palestinos (como Roberto Bishara) en la selección de fútbol de Palestina. También se ve reflejada la influencia de esta comunidad en el deporte en el Estadio Palestino y en el Club Deportivo Palestino, en Primera División del fútbol chileno

Orográficamente es producto de elevación y plegamiento rocoso que se originó durante el Cretáceo, cuando la corteza terrestre de la placa de Nazca inició la subducción bajo la placa sudamericana, dando lugar a un elevamiento que llega hasta los 6768 msnm en el nevado Huascarán y a la formación de una cordillera volcánica al sur del Perú. Biogeográficamente es una región que presenta una vegetación con una densidad intermedia entre la costa desértica y la selva tropical, y con clima de montaña que va de subtropical a frío según la altitud. Culturalmente está relacionado con la cultura andina del Perú, que étnicamente es quechua y aimara mayormente.


== Clima de la sierra ==
El clima de la Sierra está relacionado con la altitud, la latitud y la cercanía a la costa desértica o a la selva húmeda. En general se considera que el clima serrano característico va de subtropical a frío, con aire muy seco y tiene dos fases estacionales, una lluviosa entre noviembre y marzo, y una seca de abril a octubre. El piso nival de congelación permanente comienza a los 4,800 msnm como promedio, por lo que hay numerosas montañas y cordilleras nevadas. Sin embargo el calentamiento global está variando estas condiciones, por lo que el hielo por encima de los 5,000 msnm está en retroceso.[1]​


== Cordilleras ==

Se considera que hay unas 20 cordilleras nevadas, las cuales se agrupan en tres sectores de norte a sur:
Los Andes del norte: Desde la frontera con Ecuador hasta el nudo de Pasco. Destaca por su altitud la Cordillera Blanca en Ancash.
Los Andes centrales: Del nudo de Pasco al nudo de Vilcanota.
Los Andes del Sur: Desde el nudo de Vilcanota hasta las fronteras con Bolivia y Chile, envolviendo todo el Altiplano peruano.
Por otro lado se pueden dividir también de oeste a este en las siguientes 3 cordilleras:
La Cordillera Occidental: Tiene la mayor altitud continua, por lo que constituye la divisoria continental entre la cuenca del Pacífico y las cuencas al interior del continente.
La Cordillera Central: En el sector norte divide los valles interandinos del Marañón y del Huallaga, y en el sector centro es discontínua.
La Cordillera Oriental: En su mayor parte es una cordillera de selva de poca altitud, salvo al sur que es divisoria entre la cuenca del Titicaca y la cuenca amazónica.


== Nevados ==

La cordillera está coronada por las montañas de nieves perpetuas. Por encima de los 6000 msnm hay más de 30 nevados y por encima de los 5000 msnm son más de mil. El Alpamayo es considerado uno de los nevados más bellos del mundo.


== Glaciares ==

El Perú cuenta con el 71% de los glaciares tropicales del mundo, que en el 2014 eran un total de 2 679 que ocupan un área de 1 298.59 km² distribuidos en 19 cordilleras[2]​


== Volcanes ==

Los volcanes se encuentran sólo al sur del Perú y en la cordillera volcánica, ya que esa región forma parte de la zona volcánica central de los Andes. El volcán más elevado es el Coropuna con 6,425 msnm, el más activo el Ubinas y el más impresionante el Misti,[3]​ símbolo de la ciudad de Arequipa.


== Pisos altitudinales ==

El geógrafo peruano Javier Pulgar Vidal vio que los pisos ecológicos de los Andes peruanos están en relación con su altitud. Haciendo un aparte del piso basal donde se sitúa la Costa y la Selva, en los Andes se definen las siguientes regiones:
Yunga marítima: De 500 a 2,300 msnm del flanco occidental de los Andes peruanos, equivalente a un piso altitudinal de premontano a montano bajo.
Yunga fluvial: De 1,000 a 2,300 msnm del flanco oriental, equivalente a un piso montano bajo.
Quechua: De 2,300 a 3,500 msnm, equivalente a un piso montano alto.
Suni: De 3,500 a 4,000 msnm, equivalente a un piso subalpino.
Puna: De 4,000 a 4,800 msnm, equivalente a un piso alpino.
Janca: De 4,800 a 6,768 msnm, equivalente a un piso nival.


== Ecorregiones ==

La sierra peruana presenta diferentes ecosistemas montanos, por lo que puede dividirse biogeográficamente en las siguientes ecorregiones:
Puna: Región altoandina situada por encima de los 3800 msnm como promedio, con clima frío de montaña subhúmedo, una flora de tundra y fauna adaptada a la altura.
Jalca o Páramo: Región altoandina del norte del Perú por encima de los 3500 msnm como promedio, con clima de montaña húmedo y una flora de páramo.
Serranía esteparia: Situada en el flanco occidental de los Andes por encima de los 1000 msnm como promedio, limita con la Puna, con clima semiárido y vegetación de estepa.
Yungas: Situada en el flanco oriental de los Andes justo por encima de la llanura amazónica, desde los 500 hasta los 3,800 msnm y con ecosistemas variables que van desde la selva alta cálida, nubosa, densa y lluviosa, hasta la serranía de humedad estacional, fría y parcialmente boscosa.
Bosques y valles secos: Sectores de los Andes peruanos presentan el ecosistema de Bosque seco (sin lluvias la mayor parte del año) especialmente en el norte del país, donde destaca la ecorregión del Bosque seco del Marañón. También son secos los valles de Huánuco (río Huallaga), Tarma, Mantaro, Apurímac, Pampas y Urubamba.


== Cultura andina ==

Se considera que el Perú es uno de los siete países que tiene una cultura originaria y capaz de una gran biodiversidad, con desarrollo neolítico independiente que aparece hace más de 5,000 años con el desarrollo de la agricultura (papa, achira), ganadería (auquénidos), cerámica y construcción de viviendas; lo que llevaría al desarrollo paulatino de las culturas preincas. El advenimiento del Imperio incaico fijó en los Andes peruanos el centro de su desarrollo cultural que se extendió por la mayor parte de la cordillera de los Andes. Los actuales descendientes de los antiguos peruanos han heredado y evolucionado la milenaria cultura andina a través de infinidad de manifestaciones artísticas como la música, cerámica, textiles, danzas, creencias, uso de lenguas nativas, el cultivo de especies autóctonas, la crianza de animales, etc.
Se considera a los Andes peruanos como la zona nuclear andina, donde se dieron los más altos niveles de desarrollo político, económico y social. Una de las características notables es la constante y total interdependencia económica y social de todas las regiones que constituyen el área, especialmente en la relación mar–cordillera, esta relación se expresa en el permanente desplazamiento de corrientes de población hacia distintas direcciones y especialmente en los ejes transversales costeño–serranos. Una de las unidades integradoras en la formación de la política y la cultura fue la expresión de la cultura Chavín.
En esta área se reconocieron los siguientes períodos:
Lítico
Arcaico
Formativo
Desarrollo Regionales
Imperio Wari
Reinos confederados
Inca.

454,"Alfred Leyman (Exeter, 27 de septiembre de 1856 — Honiton, 1933) fue un acuarelista nacido en el Condado de Devon, Reino Unido, cuyos trabajos reflejaron muchos aspectos de la vida rural de Devon, entre finales del s. XIX y principios del XX.
Fue hijo único de John Francis Leyman, marino mercante, artista y fotógrafo, y de Mary Ann Leyman. Pasó la mayor parte de sus primeros años de vida en Exeter, donde conoció, en 1887, a Kate Gauntlett y donde se casó con ella. Tuvieron una hija, Mary, nacida en Honiton en 1887.
Se mudó a Honiton en 1888. En 1893 fue nombrado profesor de arte en la escuela Allhallows, un empleo que conservó hasta su muerte.[1]​
Leyman exhibió solo sus acuarelas a nivel local. En 1906, en la Exposición anual de Devon y Exeter, que tuvo lugar en la Galería de Arte Elands, expuso 16 de sus obras. Enfocó su trabajo a los paisajes rurales, marinas, puertos entre ellas, si bien también hizo retratos, escenas de la vida cotidiana de Devon y Cornwall y algunos escasos ejemplos de paisajes de Dorset y Somerset.[2]​ Recorrió centenares de kilómetros con su caja de pinturas y su caballete.
Un cierto número de sus obras han sido vendidas en subastas.[3]​
Falleció en Honiton en 1933 a la edad de 76 años. Su hija Mary no se casó y vivió en la residencia familiar hasta su fallecimiento en 1963.

456,"Juan Orts Román (Elche, 22 de septiembre de 1898 - Orihuela, 18 de junio de 1958) fue un humanista, erudito y escritor español.


== Biografía ==


=== Orígenes ===
Juan nació en el seno de una familia acomodada. Su padre, Juan Orts Miralles adquirió el Huerto del Cura tras el fallecimiento del capellán Castaño, huerto que Juan (el primogénito de seis hermanos), heredaría más tarde.


=== Evolución ===
Se licenció en derecho por la Universidad Central de Madrid, y más tarde desarrolló su carrera profesional en el negocio familiar, entre Elche y Orihuela. No obstante, su verdadera pasión fueron las humanidades, y pronto comenzó a escribir relatos y a colaborar en la prensa (a los 13 años publicó su primer artículo periodístico en ""Nueva Illice""). Su sólida formación cultural y humanística (con claras influencias de sus paisanos Gabriel Miró y Azorín) le permitió ocupar diferentes cargos en su ciudad natal, entre ellos el de Cronista Oficial de la ciudad de Elche (cargo en el que sucedió a Don Pedro Ibarra Ruiz [1], con el cual le unía una gran amistad) y Patrono del Misteri d'Elx. Como reconocimiento a su esfuerzo en pro de la cultura, fue nombrado Académico de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, y se le concedió la Encomienda al mérito civil. Sus restos descansan, por indicación propia, en la capilla del Huerto.


== Legado cultural ==


=== Obra literaria ===
La mayoría de sus obras literarias giran en torno a temas relacionados con la ciudad de Elche:
En 1943, publica ""Guió de la Festa o Misteri d'Elx. Para uso de los actores y de cuantos intervienen en dicha representación"" , que en palabras de Francisco Orts Serrano ""...es sin duda una obra en la que Juan Orts vierte todos sus conocimientos sobre lo que es el trasfondo teatral del Misteri. Cuando lo escribió era su Director de Escena y, como él dice, ""es para uso de los actores y de cuantos intervienen en dicha representación"". Los amantes del Misteri tienen asegurado un rato de lectura deliciosa porque encontrarán en la obrita detalles inimaginables. Muestra todo aquello que está detrás de lo que ve el espectador, desde las normas para la escena, las indicaciones para los caballeros portaestandarte y electos, las condiciones para ser actores, las normas que deben seguir los mismos, sus movimientos en el escenario y un largo etcétera..."";
""Nicolás de Bussy, el más original de todos los imagineros"";
""Ética y Estética de la Palmera"";
""Desventura, misterio y rescate de la Dama de Elche"";
""Descripción emotiva del Misterio de Elche"";
Santa María, basílica;
En 1948, ""Desventura y misterio de la esfinge de la Alcudia"".


=== Aportación al jardín Huerto del Cura ===
Su contribución más relevante sería conseguir la transformación del Huerto del Cura (del que fue dueño desde que falleciese su padre), convirtiéndolo en un jardín de recreo de proyección turística internacional. Reformó la casa, modificando la fachada principal, y la convirtió en su vivienda permanente. Desde allí, comenzó la tarea de dar a conocer su Huerto, invitando a personalidades ilustradas de la época. En etapas anteriores, el Huerto había sido visitado de manera puntual por personajes políticos. Pero más tarde Juan atraía a figuras del mundo del la cultura, acogiéndolos en su propia casa, haciéndolos partícipe de la magia del Huerto y fomentando también el conocimiento de la representación religiosa del Misterio de Elche. Este trabajo dio sus frutos y en 1943 el Huerto del Cura obtuvo la distinción de Jardín Artístico Nacional y en 2000 fue declarado por la Unesco como Patrimonio de la Humanidad junto a los demás huertos del Palmeral de Elche.[1]​

457,"Chita (originalmente y en inglés, Cheeta, a veces escrito Cheetah) es el nombre del chimpancé que acompaña al personaje de Tarzán en casi todas sus películas, interpretado por diversos chimpancés.[1]​[2]​ Fue añadido por la industria cinematográfica, puesto que no figura en ninguna de las novelas originales de Tarzán escritas por Edgar Rice Burroughs; únicamente en las últimas aparece un compañero primate llamado Nkima que podría haber inspirado a Chita. Aunque en español ha sido conocida como mona Chita, se trata de un macho.


== Intérpretes y polémicas ==
El único chimpancé de cuya participación en las primeras películas de los años 1930 con Johnny Weissmüller hay constancia clara es Jiggs, que murió en 1938.[2]​ Desde las últimas décadas del siglo XX al menos dos chimpancés llamados Cheeta han sido presentados como participantes en aquellas películas, con lo que habrían alcanzado una longevidad muy elevada para unos chimpancés en cautividad:[2]​[3]​
Un chimpancé, también llamado Mike,[4]​ que vivía en el santuario de primates de Suncoast, en Palm Harbor, Florida, y que según sus cuidadores llegó allí en los años 1960 desde una propiedad de Johnny Weissmüller en Ocala; no hay evidencias que lo demuestren, y el Santuario nunca facilitó una biografía consistente del chimpancé.[2]​[3]​ Cheeta/Mike murió el 24 de diciembre de 2011 debido a una insuficiencia renal.[5]​
Un chimpancé que vive en el santuario de primates C.H.E.E.T.A. (Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes, ‘Hábitats Originales y Mejorados para Simios Amenazados y en Peligro de Extinción’), dedicado al cuidado y protección de simios que se hayan dedicado al espectáculo, y ubicado en Palm Springs, California. Sus cuidadores aseguraban inicialmente que había nacido en Liberia en 1932 y llegado a los pocos meses a Nueva York en vuelo transatlántico. Este chimpancé recibió el premio Calabuch del Festival Internacional de Cine de Comedia de Peñíscola, España, en 2006, y por su supuesta edad, fue reconocido en el Libro Guinness de los récords como el simio más longevo del mundo.[6]​ No obstante, una investigación del periodista R. D. Rosen publicada por The Washington Post en 2008 señaló que los vuelos transatlánticos se iniciaron en 1939, y demostró que este chimpancé había nacido hacia 1960 y que no constaba su participación en película alguna,[1]​ por lo que desde entonces el santuario dice desconocer los detalles sobre su pasado.[7]​

461,"El Boleo es una antigua mina de cobre ubicada en las cercanías de la localidad de Santa Rosalía (Baja California Sur) en México.


== Yacimiento ==
El yacimiento se encuentra cerca del volcán de las Tres Vírgenes y la antigua mina de plata de Santa María.[1]​ El mineral tiene un 15% de cobre, contenido bastante excepcional, y está compuesto de una mezcla compleja de óxidos y sulfuros. Se originó por oxidación en las zonas sedimentarias sumergidas por el mar, facilitada por una reacción química entre las sales de cloruro con sulfuros de plomo y cobre.[2]​
La mina comenzó a conocerse como «el boleo» («conjunto de bolas») debido a que el mineral de cobre apareció en una matriz en una configuración más o menos esférica.[3]​
La alta calidad del mineral se debe a la ausencia de arsénico y antimonio en el proceso de refinación, facilitado por la fuerte oxidación natural que presenta. Esto lo vuelve tan rentable como el extraído en la mina de Chuquicamata (Chile).[4]​


== Historia ==
En 1868, un ranchero mexicano llamado José Rosas Villavicencio encontró un mineral extraño en una región deshabitada de la península de Baja California y tomó unas muestras. Con la intención de averiguar si tienen algún valor se lo mostró al capitán de un barco, lo que llamó la atención de dos ciudadanos alemanes quienes le pagaron al ranchero para que les indicara donde lo había obtenido. Los alemanes se desplazaron hasta la zona que les indicó Villavicencio e iniciaron inmediatamente una labor de prospección geofísica.[5]​
Desde 1870, la mina comenzó a ser explotada a baja escala por distintos equipos de mineros; hasta que, en 1872 y tras dos años de disputas legales, Carlos Eisenman y Eustaquio Valle ganaron la concesión.[5]​[6]​ Para ello fundaron una empresa a la que llamaron «El Boleo». En 1879, las fluctuaciones en el precio del cobre y las técnicas rudimentarias de explotación provocaron el quiebre de la compañía.[6]​


=== Descubrimiento del potencial del yacimiento ===
El cobre proveniente de esta mina se había estado exportando a Europa desde 1872, principalmente a Suecia e Inglaterra, lo que llamó la atención de la familia Rothschild que decidió enviar a dos geólogos franceses a México con la intención de averiguar el origen del mineral y determinar el potencial de la mina.[5]​ Esto se debe a que, en aquella época, el mercado mundial del cobre estaba dominado por un único gran productor, Rio Tinto Company Limited a través de la explotación de la mina Corta Atalaya ubicada en Minas de Riotinto, Provincia de Huelva, España.[7]​
Poco tiempo después, un ingeniero francés llamado Georges de la Bouglise descubre el potencial geológico de la mina, tras analizar una muestra de mineral. Él era accionista y presidente, desde 1881, de Société anonyme des mines de Lexington, que explotaba una veta de plata cerca de Butte (Montana) donde se habían identificado grandes cantidades de cobre que demostraron ser fáciles de procesar. Para aprovechar las ventajas de los avances tecnológicos en el procesamiento de cobre, se decidió llevar a cabo una investigación de viabilidad en México. Resultado de esto escribió, junto con Edouard Cumenge, un informe geológico fechado el 15 de diciembre de 1884,[8]​ con el cual convenció al banco Mirabaud y la familia Rothschild para invertir fuertemente en Baja California mediante la adquisición de la mina para explotar no sólo la parte superficial del depósito, sino también la masa existente en la profundidad, con toda la infraestructura necesaria para llevarlo a cabo.

La publicación del informe inicia un proceso especulativo en la Bolsa de Boston, fogoneado por las acciones de Calumet et Hecla Mining Company. Hecho que se repitió dos años más tarde, esta vez causado por Eugène Secrétan quien a través de la Société des métaux comenzó un proceso de acaparamiento de este metal.[9]​ Este incidente causó la escasez de cobre de 1887 y permanece como el movimiento especulativo más importante en la historia de la producción del cobre.


=== Compagnie du Boléo ===
El entonces presidente de México, Porfirio Díaz, otorgó una nueva concesión a una compañía francesa con la intención de restaurar relaciones diplomáticas con Francia, rotas desde la muerte de Maximiliano de Habsburgo; esta compró la anterior compañía con un millón de pesos oro y firmó un contrato con el presidente Díaz el 7 de julio de 1885 para fundar una colonia minera con todo lo necesario: campamentos, casas, talleres, laboratorios, ferrocarril y acueductos; con el nombre de Compagnie du Boleo y la colonia Santa Rosalía.
La concesión minera era de las extensas del Porfiriato, llamado Distrito Minero Santa Águeda que abarcaba desde Santa Rosalía hasta Mulegé; Mandaron traer a los geólogos Cumenege de la empresa Río Tinto (Casa Rothschild) los ingenieros Fluchs y La Bougliese, profesores de la escuela de Minas de París, elaboraron un informe en torno al estado real que guardan los minerales; la comisión reportó que había ahí 900 mil toneladas de mineral (una variedad de reciente descubrimiento, Boleítas) cobre de ley, en óptimas condiciones de para ser fundido y calcularon el tiempo que iban a explotarlos: 50 años. A la compañía se le exentaba impuestos de aduana de sus embarcaciones por el mismo periodo de tiempo.[6]​

La Compagnie du Boleo se encontraba bajo la Dirección General de Charles Laforgue, este señor dictaba las órdenes desde París, Francia; a Santa Rosalía al norteamericano William W. Rose, quien en ese tiempo ostentaba el nombramiento de Director Local. La iglesia del lugar, Santa Bárbara, fue diseñada en el año de 1884 por el ingeniero francés Gustavo Eiffel, el mismo que construyó la torre homónima, y construida el año de 1887, fue mostrada en la Exposición Universal de París en 1889 como prototipo destinado a las posesiones francesas en África. Laforgue le compró esta iglesia la cual tiene el mismo estilo del Palacio de Hierro en Veracruz, otra obra de Eiffel, que también estaba en la misma exposición.[6]​
Para 1890, el ferrocarril usado en el transporte del mineral abarcaba 38 km con 5 locomotoras, 118 vagonetas para transportar mineral y carbón, 11 plataformas, 7 tanques para agua y un carro de pasajeros. El primer horno de fundición water jacket se instaló en 1886, pero luego se amplió hasta seis más capaces de procesar 100 toneladas diarias. De los hornos salía cobre negro, con 95% de cobre puro y el cobre mate, con el 75%, la escoria resultante de comprimía en bloques usados en la construcción del puerto. Se hizo legendaria la rivalidad con las operaciones mineras de Cananea, Sonora; ambas ciudades competían en quien producía más cobre en los informes anuales del gobierno federal.


=== Crecimiento de la población ===

Los primeros pobladores permanentes fueron un centenar de indígenas yaquis que fueron traídos desde la prisión de Guaymas por Eisenman y Valle para trabajar en la mina. Luego el número de indígenas que trabajaban allí iría en aumento.[5]​
En la década de 1890 la compañía emplea a su propio jefe de la policía, quien le reporta directamente al director de la mina. Durante estos años el agua se racionaba porque era necesario construir un canal. El 19 de mayo de 1899 se publica una carta abierta en un periódico de Mazatlán recomendando no migrar al sitio a causa de la alta mortalidad causada por las enfermedades.[5]​ Con el tiempo, la provisión de agua se incrementa y se proveen servicios médicos gratuitos a cargo de la compañía.


=== Crecimiento industrial ===
El 29 de julio de 1907, el vicepresidente de México, Ramón Corral, llegó a Santa Rosalía en un barco con el mismo nombre, la población lo recibió masivamente y las casa de adornado con banderas y listones, El Sr. Corral se hospedó en el Hotel Francés y en la noche se dio una cena en su honor.[6]​ Durante la Revolución Mexicana, la Compagnie du Boleo se volvió sumamente estratégico para los intereses porfiristas y maderistas al ser la única zona minera sin afectaciones por el conflicto; arribaron en barco soldados porfiristas manteniendo el orden civil hasta la renuncia de Porfirio Díaz; cuando los mineros trataron de asaltar la tienda de raya en el enfrentamiento los soldados mataron un minero e hiriendo a otros dos. En diciembre de 1912, el Vice-presidente de la República, José María Pino Suárez llegó al puerto para entregar la documentación sobre Reglamento de Seguridad Para Trabajadores Mineros promulgados por Madero el 8 de octubre del mismo año. Pino Suárez aseguró en un mitín que si los mineros o franceses no se sentía a gusto con el Reglamento, podía abandonar el lugar libremente.[6]​ Durante la dictadura de Victoriano Huerta el revolucionario Manuel F. Montoya estableció una base en el Hotel Central Moderno, el gobierno huertista envió al cañonero Tampico que con una única bala de cañón destruyó el Hotel matando a Montoya y su armada; el Tampico cargó algunas toneladas de cobre y luego se hundió el 14 de abril de 1914 en Sinaloa.
En 1938 se cumplía los cincuenta años predichos para la explotación del cobre dónde inevitablemente la producción del cobre decae, se abre pozos más profundos en los existentes y extrayendo varias vetas de manganeso los cuales había sido ignorados por décadas, esto permitió la existencia de la compañía por 16 años más.
En 1954 la compañía francesa El Boleo, S.A., cierra operaciones en el poblado al considerar agotados los yacimientos, lo que provoca un éxodo de habitantes. Ante esta situación, el Gral. Agustín Olachea Avilés, Gobernador de Baja California Sur (1946-1956) promovió con el apoyo de la Comisión Nacional de Fomento Minero, la formación de una empresa de capital mixto, que permitiera la subsistencia de dicha mina, con lo que se reinicia la explotación minera que concluye en 1972 al haberse agotado los yacimientos de cobre.

Pero terminó también la señalización de la separación de la misma KMFDM, al menos por un tiempo. Grabado en Seattle, Washington , este fue el último álbum con En Esch y Günter Schulz, quienes pasaron a formar Idiot Slick. Tras la ruptura, miembro fundador Sascha Konietzko creó la banda MDFMK, antes de reformar KMFDM en 2002 sin Esch o Schulz.
El álbum fue lanzado el 20 de abril de 1999, en la misma fecha la masacre de Columbine se llevó a cabo. Eric Harris y Dylan Klebold, los dos autores de la matanza, ambos eran aficionados ávidos de KMFDM. Eric Harris señaló la coincidencia de título y fecha de lanzamiento del álbum en su diario.[2]​
Una re edición remasterizada digitalmente de Adios fue re-lanzado el 8 de mayo de 2007, junto con Symbols.


== Antecedentes ==
El núcleo de formación se unió en el gira por John DeSalvo, Nivek Ogre, y Tim Sköld. Adios fue escrito casi en su totalidad por Konietzko y Sköld, que se convirtió en un miembro oficial de la versión final de la banda con la cera Wax Trax!/TVT Records. Schulz, que había hecho la escritura significativa para los cinco discos anteriores, sólo actuó como músico de estudio, mientras que Esch ayudó a escribir solamente un par de canciones.

465,"Los primeros tambores africanos se escucharon en Cuba desde el siglo XVI durante ciertas fiestas, como la del Día de Reyes y la de Carnestolendas o Carnaval, ya que su uso estaba restringido al ámbito de sociedades de ayuda mutua, llamadas Cabildos de Nación, donde se permitía a los esclavos y sus descendientes reunirse para cultivar su cultura y religión.
La música y la danza del Carnaval cubano fue siempre muy popular en Cuba, y ha ejercido una importante influencia en otros géneros de la música cubana, tal como la Conga de Salón y el ritmo Mozambique.[1]​ La Conga cubana ha trascendido las fronteras nacionales para convertirse en uno de los más conocidos y apreciados géneros de la música cubana en el extranjero, como las famosas Congas de salón de finales de los años treinta y principios de los cuarenta Bim Bam Bum, de Rafael Hernández y Uno dos y tres, de Rafael Ortiz, la que más tarde se hizo popular en inglés como: One, two, three, Kick![2]​Más recientemente, en 1985, la famosa Conga del grupo Cubano-americano Miami Sound Machine, desencadenó un verdadero furor en los Estados Unidos y alrededor del mundo. Su éxito solamente puede ser comparado a la popularidad que alcanzó la Conga de salón en los Estados Unidos y Europa durante los años treinta, o a las líneas de Conga popularizadas por Desi Arnaz en los años cincuenta.[3]​


== Del siglo XVI al XVIII ==
El mestizaje del negro y el blanco comienza en Cuba con la llegada a la isla de las primeras esclavas africanas hacia 1550,[4]​ pero sus culturas se mantuvieron relativamente independientes durante cientos de años, debido a que los esclavos no tenían acceso a las tradiciones culturales de sus amos, y los españoles percibían a la cultura africana como bárbara y primitiva. La siguiente descripción de una fiesta de negros esclavos, incluida en un relato por el escritor costumbrista Francisco Baralt, pone en evidencia la imagen negativa que poseían los españoles de las manifestaciones culturales del africano. Según Francisco Baralt: “esos bailes [africanos] tienen un aspecto tan extraño, por el lugar, la hora y los personajes que los ejecutan, que aún a los mismos que los presencian todos los días les produce una sensación bien difícil de expresar: no se sabe si es curiosidad o repugnancia, si atrae o repele su carácter salvaje y primitivo que parece poner entre esas fiestas y las reuniones y saraos de los hombres civilizados la distancia que media entre el diluvio y la época que alcanzamos.”[5]​ La música de los africanos que llegaron a Cuba desde España, o directamente desde África, fue solamente permitida desde el inicio de la colonización dentro de ciertas sociedades de ayuda mutua y fraternidades religiosas cuya fundación se remonta al siglo XVI. Según David H. Brown, aquellas sociedades, llamadas cabildos, “proveían en caso de enfermedad o muerte, celebraban misas para los difuntos, colectaban fondos para la liberación de sus miembros de la esclavitud, organizaban regularmente danzas y actividades recreativas los domingos y días de fiesta, y patrocinaban misas, procesiones y bailes de carnaval (ahora llamados comparsas) alrededor del ciclo anual de festivales católicos.”[6]​
Los cabildos organizaban grandes procesiones callejeras durante los domingos, las celebraciones de santos y algunos importantes días feriados, donde sus dirigentes y acompañantes se vestían con atuendos propios de los reyes y los altos rangos militares, mientras que los que participaban en las procesiones y bailes llevaban “tocados de plumas y máscaras africanas con cuernos y adornos vegetales.” El Día de Reyes, que se celebraba el 6 de enero durante la Epifanía, era la más importante de aquellas festividades.[6]​
Otra importante celebración donde participaban los cabildos fue la que se celebraba los tres días anteriores al Miércoles de Ceniza, los cuales se convirtieron en días festivos conocidos como Carnestolendas o Carnaval.[7]​ En 1697, el italiano Gemeli Careri mencionaba ésas celebraciones: “…el domingo 9 de febrero los negros y mulatos, con pintorescos atuendos, formaron una congregación para divertirse en el carnaval.” Según Virtudes Feliú: “…Este es el dato más antiguo relativo a las comparsas tradicionales habaneras y deja en claro que efectivamente los negros y mulatos se divertían en las Carnestolendas que celebraban los hispánicos y sus descendientes, vistiendo para ello ropas inusuales propias de estos festejos y en una agrupación o colectivo que Careri denomina “congregación”, seguramente porque no se usaba aún (o él desconocía) el vocablo actual de “comparsa”.[8]​
Podemos deducir que los instrumentos utilizados en las festividades de los antiguos cabildos fueron los membranófonos africanos que no estaban destinados a las celebraciones rituales, como los tambores de bembé y yuka. En referencia a la diferencia entre los tambores rituales africanos, los cuales sólo podían ser ejecutados en celebraciones religiosas, y los profanos, que sí podían ser tocados en público dice Argeliers León: “A diferencia de los tambores rituales batá e iyesá, los cuales eran afinados por medio de un sistema de tensión en N..., los tambores de bembé sí se podían atesar por medio del calor, pues no poseían el carácter ritual de los tambores consagrados.” También dice León al respecto que “…Los tambores de bembé son muy variados, desde los de gran tamaño – de más de un metro de alto y cilindroides – hasta tamborcitos hechos de barriles de envase. En ciertas zonas de Cuba, los tambores de bembé son hechos de tronco de palma, con un sólo parche clavado, y de poco más de medio metro de altura…”[9]​
El conjunto de yuka estaba formado por tres tambores hechos de troncos rústicos (llamados por orden de tamaño: caja, mula y cachimbo) con parches de cuero de buey clavados al cuerpo del tambor, y se utilizaban los toques con dos palos sobre un trozo horadado de bambú llamado guagua o catá, o directamente sobre la caja del tambor.[10]​
Con respecto a los tambores ejecutdos por los africanos en sus fiestas, el escritor costumbrista Francisco Baralt escribe hacia 1846: “El instrumento único que se usa en estas fiestas es una especie de tambor de un solo pedazo de madera de dos o cuatro pies de largo, de forma irregular y aproximándose más o menos a las figuras cónica o cilíndrica, hueco hasta la mitad, y más generalmente horadado y cubierto el extremo de más diámetro con un cuero de carnero o chivo, rapado y sin curtir.”[11]​

También coinciden estas descripciones con las representaciones visuales de los Carnavales en La Habana del siglo XIX, de artistas como Víctor Patricio de Landaluze y Federico Mialhe, donde aparecen frecuentemente los tambores cilíndricos de parche clavado, ejecutados a horcajadas entre las piernas de los tamboreros, de forma muy parecida a como se ejecutan aún hoy día los tambores yuka.En numerosos grabados de los pintores Landaluze y Miahle sobre las festividades de carnaval podemos apreciar algunos instrumentos, como los tambores y los cuernos o bocinas que se acostumbraba ejecutar en aquellas ocasiones. A la izquierda, en un famoso grabado de Miahle, 1855, llamado Día de Reyes, se encuentra un tamborero tocando a horcajadas un tambor cilindrico y otro hombre detrás con sombrero, soplando un cuerno encorvado.


== El siglo XIX ==
De acuerdo con David H. Brown: “Después de 1792, cuando los cabildos fueron forzosamente relegados a la zona de extramuros, las procesiones de carnaval salían de sus localizaciones y penetraban por las entradas hacia la fortificación que constituía el área de intramuros. Ellos marchaban a través de las vías residenciales y comerciales de las calles Mercaderes, Obispo y O’Reilly hacia la central Plaza de Armas, el sitio del Palacio del Capitán General de la isla. En el patio del Palacio, así como en otras paradas a lo largo del camino, los miembros de las procesiones representaban bailes, demandaban y recibían aguinaldos (donaciones monetarias), y entonces regresaban a sus casas.”[12]​
En el siguiente relato de 1866 el autor menciona los sonidos característicos, así como los instrumentos que eran ejecutados por los que participaban en la procesión de una comparsa del Día de Reyes en la Habana:
“Innumerables grupos de comparsas de negros africanos transitan a través de todas las calles de la capital. El barullo es inmenso, su aspecto horroroso… El ruido creado por todos los tambores, los cuernos [bocinas o cornetas] y los silbatos aturden a los transeuntes en todas partes; en una esquina un rey Yoruba rodeado por su falange de negros, aquí un Gangá, y allá otro de la nación Carabalí… todos ellos reyes por un día, cantando en tono monótono y desagradable en sus lenguas africanas.”[13]​


== El siglo XX ==
Al inicio de la guerra de independencia, en 1895, las autoridades coloniales suspendieron todas las actividades carnavalescas indefinidamente, y esa prohibición se mantuvo en efecto hasta la conclusión de las hostilidades a principios del siglo XX.
El alcalde de La Habana, Carlos de La Torre, reinstauró las festividades de Carnaval oficialmente en 1902. La masiva participación de la población de origen africano en la guerra de independencia dio como resultado una mayor integración del afro-cubano a las actividades de la sociedad, y propició que su participación en el Carnaval fuera más amplia durante los primeros años de la república. Por primera vez los negros cubanos fueron autorizados a ejecutar su música y sus danzas junto a las comparsas de blancos como El Alacrán, los carros modelo T cubiertos de flores y las carrozas.[14]​
Desde 1902, las autoridades municipales comenzaron de nuevo a regular estrictamente la organización de las procesiones de carnaval, mostrando preferencia por los carros ornamentados, las carrozas, las bandas militares, y la presentación del Rey y la Reina, en detrimento de las manifestaciones de origen afro-cubano como la comparsa y la Conga, y hacia 1916 la supresión de los grupos de comparsa en La Habana fue casi total.[15]​ Debido a que durante el período de entre los años mil novecientos y mil novecientos diez, los espectáculos carnavalescos habían atraído a miles de visitantes extranjeros a la capital cada primavera, finalmente en 1937, las autoridades de la ciudad tomaron la decisión de reautorizar las comparsas en los paseos de carnaval.[16]​
En 1937, las comparsas comenzaron a participar permanentemente en los Carnavales habaneros, desfilando a través del Paseo del Prado con sus distintivas coreografías, bailes y canciones. Estos grupos incluían El Alacrán, de la barriada del Cerro, Los Marqueses de Atarés, Las Boyeras de Los Sitios, Los Dandys de Belén, La Sultana de Colón, Las Jardineras de Jesús María, Los Componedoras de Batea de Cayo Hueso, El Príncipe del Raj de Marte, las Mexicanas de Dragones, Los Moros Azules de Guanabacoa, El Barracón de Puelo Nuevo y Los Guaracheros de Regla.
Celebrados en el mes de julio, Los Carnavales de Santiago de Cuba y otros pueblos orientales poseían sus propias características. En vez de encontrarse reducidas a ciertas calles y plazas como en la capital, las comparsas santiagueras se extendían a toda la ciudad y la población participaba más activamente en ellas. El estilo y el carácter de la música y la danza eran también diferentes.[17]​
Poco después de 1959, las autoridades revolucionarias cambiaron la celebración de los carnavales de febrero y marzo al 26 de julio. En principio se realizó ese cambio para no interrumpir la cosecha de la caña en 1979, pero lo mantuvieron más tarde con el propósito de celebrar el “triunfo del socialismo”. Entre los años de 1990 y 1995 se realizaron aisladas representaciones, las cuales estuvieron ligadas a eventos políticos. Estas incluyeron algunos grupos que salieron a la calle en noviembre de 1993 para celebrar el aniversario de los CDR. Finalmente, en un intento por atraer mayor cantidad de turistas, el gobierno autorizó de nuevo una modesta celebración de carnaval precediendo a la celebración de la Cuaresma, en vez de en julio como se hacía anteriormente.[18]​


== La música del Carnaval Cubano ==

Las agrupaciones instrumentales del carnaval cubano suelen ser muy variadas; pero aun así, es posible determinar ciertos patrones en cuanto a los conjuntos instrumentales utilizados en La Habana y Santiago de Cuba, los cuales difieren significativamente.
Así describe Argeliers León el formato instrumental básico de la comparsa habanera: “… En otras zonas de la población quedaban otros grupos instrumentales como el de las comparsas, integrados por una Conga, una tumbadora y un quinto, una caja de redoblante (sin las cuerdas de resonancia), un cencerro doble o jimagua, un bombo o dos sartenes clavadas en un cajón o sobre un tablero. Este equipo podía ampliarse con otras tumbadoras y una o más trompetas.[19]​
El tambor llamado Conga o tumbadora, de evidente origen bantú, es, según dice Fernando Ortiz: “…un tambor de origen africano, hecho de listones de madera y aros de hierro, de aproximadamente un metro de largo, forma de barril, y abierto en un extremo con un solo parche de cuero de buey fijado con clavos al cuerpo del tambor..” Antiguamente se afinaba por medio de calor, pero actualmente es afinado por medio de llaves metálicas.[20]​ El diámetro de las tumbadoras es el siguiente, de la más aguda a la más grave: requinto (9 a 10 pulgadas de diámetro), quinto (10 a 11 pulgadas), Conga (macho o tres-dos) (11 a 12 pulgadas), tumbadora (o hembra) (12 a 13 pulgadas), retumbadora (o mambisa) (14 pulgadas).[21]​
En las comparsas y Congas santiagueras se utilizan varios tambores bimembranófonos ejecutados con una baqueta: un requinto, tres Congas (sin relación alguna con la tumbadora o Conga habanera), las cuales se subdividen en dos redoblantes o galletas, y un pilón. También son utilizados varios tambores membranófonos (de forma cónica con un sólo parche tocados con las palmas de las manos) llamados bocúes. Los tambores son complementados con tres idiófonos metálicos percutidos (confeccionados a partir de tamboras de automóviles desechadas), los cuales son seleccionados de acuerdo a su sonoridad.[22]​
Los instrumentos de viento están representados por el penetrante sonido de la corneta china, instrumento de lengüeta doble que fue insertado en las Congas santiagueras en 1915,[23]​ y que siempre realiza el llamado inicial para comenzar a arrollar, que es como se denomina al estilo danzario de la Conga, caracterizado por una forma peculiar de marcha rítmica, arrastrando los pies y moviendo las caderas y los hombros al compás de la música.[24]​
El estilo musical de la Conga habanera es distinto del de la Conga santiaguera, y quizás el elemento que más diferencia a estos estilos es un peculiar acento rítmico dentro del compás de cuatro por cuatro, que es ejecutado en el bombo habanero o en la conga (tambor) santiaguera respectivamente.
En el caso del estilo habanero, este acento cae sobre una nota sincopada en el tercer tiempo del compás, configurando un patrón rítmico ampliamente conocido.
En la Conga santiaguera se acentúan más los tiempos fuertes del compás, induciendo de esa manera a una poderosa sensación de impulso, que incita a mover los pies junto con la pulsación rítmica. En este caso, el acento del tambor se produce entre el cuarto tiempo y el primero de siguiente compás.[25]​

Riviera es jugado como una novela gráfica, debido a su sistema Easy Trigger System, que puede cambiar de escenario o explorar usando TP (Trigger Points). Las batallas son 3 vs 4 vía ATB en modo pasivo, en donde la barra Overdrive aparece junto con la barra de ira. Solo puede usar 4 de 15 objetos, cada objeto tiene funciones, alcance y efectos distintos y sin contar con las adivinadoras, su uso es limitado.
Además, desde el capítulo 2, es jugado como simulador de citas, en donde se elige a una de las chicas aumentando su afección, lo que altera el final del juego.


=== Capítulo II: Yggdra Union ===

Yggdra Union se centra en tres juegos: en Blaze Union, Gulcasa, cuyo nombre de origen era Garlot, intenta expandir el imperio Bronquia; en Yggdra Union, Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz escapa de Bronquia hasta tres años después, en donde contraataca a Gulcasa; y en Gloria Union, los piratas intentan conquistar las islas.
En esta subserie, se usa el sistema de cartas, llamado el sistema de Unión, Union System o en caso de los hispanohablántes, Yggdra Card System. Este sistema se difiere de otros juegos de estrategia debido al uso de cartas. Cada carta solo admite un Nº limitado de movidas y un ataque por turno. Cada ataque, el Ace puede crear formaciones mientras que los acompañantes dentro de ella crean las multiuniones. Además, cada carta tiene habilidades únicas.
Se creó un spin-off para esta subserie llamado Yggdra Unison, que es un juego de estrategia en tiempo real en donde las cartas duran 5 minutos y tienen cierto tiempo de activación.


=== Capítulo III ===
No hay nombres ni información que se ha dado en el capítulo III, hasta el 2008, que iba a ser planeado un MMORPG para PC.[1]​


=== Capítulo IV: Knights in the Nightmare ===

El capítulo IV toma lugar en Aventheim, un mundo recientemente interrumpido por la invasión del ejército diabóico. Una de las heroínas invoca el Wisp, en donde éste explora Aventheim en busca de caballeros y revela el pasado de ellos, para salvar este mundo.
El juego tiene tres fases: el selector de monstruos (se salta en caso de jefes), la pantalla de tácticas, y la batalla en tiempo real, en donde el jugador controla el Wisp vía pantalla táctil llevando objetos a los personajes sin que toque los disparos enemigos y ordena a los personajes a atacar a los enemigos sin que se agote su VIT. Cada turno dura 60s y se descuenta del Wisp al cargar personajes o cuando es atacado. El jugador gana el escenario al completar la matrix de monstruos de hasta 5x5 en al menos una línea o eliminando al jefe del escenario (se dificulta con los capítulos en donde aparece la heroína).


=== Capítulo IX: Gungnir ===

El capítulo IX toma lugar en el imperio Gargandia en el año 983, en donde se enfrenta los leonicos contra los daltanios. Giulio, un adolescente de 15 años, es parte de la resistencia de Leonica, que con la llegada del arma diabólica Gungnir, decide usar contra Daltania, causando una rebelión en el imperio.
Gungnir es un juego de rol táctico con sistema ATB, pero con cambios en jugabilidad, lo que hace más dificíl, debido al realismo al bajar y en los cambios de estado.

473,"Cascante es una partida rural de Villena (Alicante, España), situada al noreste de su término municipal, entre la Sierra de San Cristóbal (o de la Villa) y la del Morrón. Su población censada en 2015 era de 96 habitantes (INE).[1]​

El nombre proviene de una finca que data al menos del siglo XV, cuando los Reyes Católicos la constituyeron mayorazgo del Capitán Mergelina, que había luchado a favor de éstos contra Juana la Beltraneja. Este mayorazgo, estaba, de hecho, repartido entre los reinos de Castilla y Aragón:

Ay una casa entre mojones de estos reynos de Castilla e los de Valençia, que se llama de Cascante.[2]​ [...] [Es] una alqueria o cortijo con unas casas prinçipales a do ay mucho arbolado, e que tiene mas de quinientas tahullas en rregadio en la parte e termino de la villa de Biar, rreyno de Valençia, y mucha tierra secano en rreyno de Castilla, termino de esta çiudad Villena.[3]​

La vía pecuaria llamada Cordel de Cascante, que discurre entre la Sierra del Morrón y la de San Cristóbal,[4]​ conformó antiguamente parte de la frontera entre Castilla y Aragón establecida a raíz del Tratado de Almizra, como atestiguan los mojones que se han hallado en la zona. En la actualidad marca la frontera entre los términos de Villena y Cañada (que había pertenecido hasta 1775 al de Biar).[5]​
En sus cercanías se halla la Rambla del Panadero, lugar en que se encontró en 1963 el Tesoro de Villena.[6]​ En 2008 la Comisión Territorial de Urbanismo de Alicante aprobó un proyecto de modificación del PGOU de Villena según el cual se edificarían unas 1700 viviendas en más de 90 km² de suelo en la zona de Cascante. Sin embargo, el proyecto se vio impugnado por la delegación del Gobierno, a raíz de un informe desfavorable de la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar y en la actualidad se halla paralizado.[7]​

476,"San Manuel es un municipio del Departamento de Cortés, en la república de Honduras.


== Historia ==


=== Fundación ===
San Manuel es uno de los pueblos más antiguos del Departamento de Cortés antes se llamaba Ulúa o Tehuma y formó parte de una de los repartimientos que hizo Don Pedro de Alvarado en 1536.
En el recuento de población de 1901 figurado como cabecera del Curato perteneciendo al partido de Tencoa habiendo sido fundada su cabecera en el lugar llamado Campín (hoy aldea) no se sabe por que fue abandonado ese lugar, trasladándolo donde se encuentra actualmente. Se le dio la categoría de Municipio en 1859 al crearse el Departamento de Cortés el 4 de julio de 1893.
En 1895 se le cambió el nombre por el de San Manuel. San Manuel consta de trece (13) Calles y catorce (14) Avenidas. El Río Ulúa es el único afluente que cruza cercano al municipio.
Con una población de 2800 entre españoles, mestizos e indios, el pueblo de Tehuma, que en lengua lenca significa “Aguas de los Maguelles Divinos”, fue fundado 46 años antes de San Pedro Sula. Ya que en 1582 reza la monografía “Era Gobernador de la Provincia de Honduras don Alonso de Contreras Guevara” y el describe las poblaciones de la jurisdicción de San Pedro Sula, mencionando los pueblos de: Llamatepec, Chinda, Talpetate, Petoa, Espolongal, Santiago, Tehuma, Trinixol, Ticamaya, Quelequele, Ibombo, Sucumba, Chapoa, Aislade Vtulio, Xocon, Teconalistagua, Chalmecas, Zumonga, Xlegua, Alao, Mopala, Caluda, Yoroc y Ximia muchos de estos pueblos en la márgenes del río Ulúa.
Sin embargo, el presbítero Licenciado Antonio Vallejo en su primer anuario estadístico de 1889 menciona que fue hasta el año 1859 cuando se le otorga el título de Municipio, siendo Presidente de la República el General José Santos Guardiola, la primera corporación municipal; según Vallejo, estuvo integrada por los señores Lázaro Crúz y Santiago Pineda como alcalde vice-alcalde respectivamente; los señores Concepción Caballero e Hilario Montoya como regidores uno, dos y Ramón Leiva como sindico municipal.
A partir de su fundación Tehuma continúo perteneciendo al partido de Tencoa como la mayoría de los pueblos de los departamentos. Fue hasta el 4 de julio de 1893 cuando el General Domingo Vásquez creo el departamento de Cortés, que definitivamente paso a ser parte de este. Dos años más tarde en 1895, se le cambiaria el nombre de Tehuma por el de San Manuel, Cortés.


=== Toponimia ===
Tehuma significa agua de los Magueyes divinos.


=== Primeros pobladores ===
Se cree que la fundación actual de los municipios en el sector obedece a la emigración de sus primeros habitantes en virtud de las constantes inundaciones de río Ulúa. Sin embargo, el antiguo pueblo de Tiuma o Tehuma, según la monografía de San Manuel, Antigua Tehuma, recopilados por los profesores Perfecto H. Bobadilla y Florencio Reyes en el documento “Monografía del Departamento de Cortés”, tenía su asiento al noreste de la población llamada “Campin” en los terrenos que un tiempo pertenecieron a Don Toribio Coello, su censo más antiguo data desde 1791 y según el mismo, “estaba habitado por 5 familias españolas, ladinas y 14 indios” las cuales pagaban tributo. Tehuma pertenecía al Partido Tencoa y posteriormente al departamento de Santa Bárbara, básicamente a la subdelegación de Chinda, como Curato, número 22.


=== Datos históricos ===
En la actualidad existen diferentes versiones de la fundación del municipio de San Manuel, Cortés, que mezcladas con la leyenda y la fantasía de la tradición oral de su población, no dejan de reflejar cierta coincidencia científica con los hechos históricos.
Según esta tradición el descubrimiento de piezas precolombinas en algunos lugares del territorio municipal eran parte de enorme tesoro arrojado al río y sus alrededores durante la conquista, el recrudecimiento de la guerra de ocupación desatada por los conquistadores, obligó a los indígenas a emigrar hacia sitios más seguros, abandonando sus riquezas, cosechas y otras pertenencias; en dice que toda la vega del río Ulúa desde pimienta hacia Cruz de Valencia que era una especie de corredor habitado por varios grupos indígenas los cuales se dedicaban a la agricultura y la pesca.
Otra teoría científica asegura que dichos indígenas habían alcanzado un grado de cultura sumamente avanzado en el campo de la alfarería, a lo largo del tiempo se han encontrado bajo tierra, vestigios de objetos fabricados con barro, piedra y jaspe, entre ellos utensilios de cocina, figuras de animales, juguetes, silbatos y otros. Dichos objetos han sido localizados en lugares como: Travesía, El Coowle, Palenque paya de los muertos, asimismo y en menor escala La Colonia Pineda, La Libertad y El Cerro El Zate.
Posteriormente en 1801 continua la fuente “el Gobernador Intendente y Comandante General” de la Provincia de Honduras, Coronel don Ramón de Anguiano, levantó un censo general de los pueblos de los pueblos de su jurisdicción al mencionar este literalmente dijo: “a la subdelegación de San Pedro Sula pertenecen: San Pedro sula, San José, Quimistán, Chinda, Tehuma, Talpetate, Santiago, Candelaria, San Francisco, La Libertad, La Trinidad, San Marcos, Macuelizo, Ticamaya y Petoa. ”

Al paso del tiempo llegó una nueva compañía “CASMUL” la cual a través de esta empresa llegaron nuevos pobladores al municipio por motivos de empleo, hasta el día de hoy esa compañía es una importante fuente de trabajo en este municipio, para la mayor parte de la población.

481,"El puente de Deusto es un puente levadizo sobre la Ría de la villa de Bilbao, capital de la provincia vasca de Vizcaya, en el norte de España. Este puente comunica los distritos bilbaínos de Abando y Deusto.


== Historia del puente ==
En diciembre de 1936 se inauguraba el puente levadizo que había sido encargado al ingeniero de caminos, canales y puertos Ignacio de Rotaeche y al ingeniero industrial José Ortiz de Artiñano en 1931. La necesidad de unir el casco histórico de la villa con las nuevos desarrollos urbanísticos que se estaban iniciando en los terrenos de las anteiglesias anexionadas de Deusto, Begoña y Abando imponía la construcción de diversos puentes sobre la ría de Bilbao (puente de Deusto y puente del Ayuntamiento).
El tráfico fluvial, fundamental para los trabajos portuarios que en aquel entonces se desarrollaban a esas alturas de la ría y que posteriormente se irían desplazando hacia el Abra, obligaba que dichos puentes fueran diseñados de tal forma que permitieran el paso de los buques.
La solución que se adoptó fue la de puentes levadizos a semejanza de los existentes en Chicago (Estados Unidos).[1]​ Siendo alcalde de la villa Federico Moyúa se encargó al arquitecto municipal Ricardo Bastida la solución que encontró al acudir al Congreso Eucarístico de Chicago de 1926 y conocer los puentes móviles, tipo cantilever, de brazos basculantes de esa ciudad. Se eligió el Puente de la Avenida Michigan, obra de los ingenieros Bennett, Pihlfeldt y Young, construido en 1920.
Los ingenieros Ignacio de Rotaeche y José Ortiz de Artiñano junto al arquitecto municipal Ricardo Bastida firmaron el proyecto inicial en enero de 1930. Este proyecto se aprobó el 23 de julio de 1931 y se comenzó a construir en julio de 1932 bajo el mandato como alcalde de Ernesto Ercoreca. Antes, el 29 de marzo se habían adjudicado las obras a las empresa Entrecanales y Tavora, que se encargaría de la cimentación; Gamboa y Domingo, Retolaza y Anacabe, de la estructura de hormigón y Basconia-MAN de la estructura metálica.
La obra, entregada el 12 de diciembre de 1936 tras cuatro años de trabajos y dos modificaciones del proyecto, una el 8 de septiembre de 1932 a propuesta de la Junta de Obras del Puerto por afecciones al ferrocarril de Bilbao a Portugalete y otra el 8 de diciembre de 1933 por motivos similares, se inauguró el 7 de diciembre.
Fue volado para la defensa de la ciudad el 18 de junio de 1937 en la Guerra Civil. Entre 1938 y 1939 fue reconstruido por las autoridades franquistas reinaugurándose el 25 de octubre de 1939, con el nombre de puente del Generalísimo (en referencia a Francisco Franco), siendo alcalde José María Oriol y Urquijo. En 1979 volvió a tener su nombre anterior.
En el año 1955 se demolieron las escaleras de acceso y entre 1974 y 1975 se reformaron los tramos móviles según proyecto del ingeniero Mariano de Lastra realizado en 1973. Esta reforma la realizó la empresa Dragados y Construcciones. En enero de 1983 se cambió el firme de la calzada, pasando de adoquinado a asfaltado. Ya en el siglo XXI, en los años 2004 y 2006 se realizaron nuevos accesos desde la avenida Abandoibarra (2004, dotado de ascensor) y la calle Botica Vieja (2006).[2]​
El puente fue escenario de las protestas y enfrentamientos con la polícia que los trabajadores de los Astilleros Euskalduna, cuyas instalaciones eran vecinas del mismo, protagonizaron en defensa de su puesto de trabajo al producirse el cierre de los astilleros en 1988.

Hasta 1992 se mantenía un tráfico estable de buques por las aguas de la ría de Bilbao que obligaba a abrir el puente. Su última apertura comercial fue el 4 de mayo de 1995 para dejar paso al buque Hoo Ckres de la naviera Pinillos.[1]​ La construcción del puente Euskalduna, con un gálibo inferior al de Deusto, impide el paso de embarciones que obliguen a abrir el puente siendo definitivo para su condena. Tras un periodo en el que se barajó el soldar e impovilizar definitivamente su tablero, se decidió mantenerlo en activo para que pueda ser abierto en conmemoraciones y festividades, como se había hecho con el paso de la gabarra del Athletic Club de Bilbao cuando ganó la liga de fútbol o el recibimiento al velero Euskadi-Europa-93- BBK del navegante en solitario José Luis Ugarte o al paso de la regata estudiantil Ingenieros-Deusto. Ha sido escenario para varias películas y se ha especulado con su cierre permanente, cosa que ha provocado la protesta de los bilbaínos. Actualmente su estado no permite la apertura completa de las dos hojas. La última apertura se realizó en marzo de 2008, para dar paso a la 28º edición de la regata Ingenieros-Deusto.[3]​ Está catalogado como elemento a proteger en grado Protección Especial, nivel A.[4]​
En octubre de 2008 el Ayuntamiento de Bilbao hace público su plan para la restauración integral de la infraestructura. Las obras, previstas para el año siguiente, tienen como objetivo el saneamiento integral, la puesta a punto de la maquinaría de elevación y un nuevo sistema de iluminación así como un cambio en el piso correspondiente a la parte peatonal. En el estudio anterior a la reforma se detectó que la barandilla, diseño de Ricardo Bastida, estaba muy deteriorada, optándose por su restauración y sustitución, en aquellos caso que su estado así lo exija, por réplicas de la misma.[5]​ La sustitución se ha realizado con elementos idénticos construidos en acero inoxidable. Se cambia el color, del verde se pasa al plateado y el pasamanos de la barandilla aloja un sistema de iluminación con leds. El pavimento de la parte móvil de la tabla del puente se ha asfaltado con una mezcla de a base de resinas y áridos de un tono rosáceo, descartándose la imitación a madera prevista en un principio.[6]​


== Características y ubicación ==

La longitud total del puente es de 500 m con una luz de 48 m estrechando el cauce de la ría que en ese punto es de 71 m, con sendos edificios de hormigón a cada lado, donde está ubicada la maquinaria de elevación. El gálibo en marea alta es de 7,96 m. La anchura del tramo móvil es de 20 metros (12 de calzada y dos aceras de 4) y del fijo, es de 25 metros (15 de calzada y aceras de 5). Las hojas basculan hasta alcanzar un ángulo de 70º sobre la horizontal. Tiene 27 vanos siendo el número 11 el que cruza la ría. Fue construido por las empresas La Naval y La Basconia.

En 1856 inicia su formación religiosa en la comunidad camiliana de Santa María del Paraíso, ingresando al Monasterio de la Visitación de Verona y renunciado a sus bienes a favor de los pobres y de la Iglesia.
El 21 de mayo de 1864 fue ordenado sacerdote, sin embargo en 1866 se dicta en Italia una ley de supresión de órdenes y congregaciones religiosas, por lo que Luis Tezza, ya superior de los clérigos en Cesiolo, Verona, debe buscar asilo en casa de amigos, al ser expulsado del pueblo. Posteriormente también estuvo en Francia donde también fue perseguido.
Llegó a Lima el 19 de junio de 1900 con el objetivo de reunificar a las comunidades religiosas del Perú a la Orden de San Camilo y posteriormente consolidar su presencia.
El 26 de setiembre de 1923, muere en la Casa de Santa María de la Buena Muerte, en Lima. En 1948 sus restos mortales fueron trasladados a Buenos Aires.
El 4 de noviembre de 2001 fue beatificado en Roma por Papa Juan Pablo II, en una ceremonia especial a la que asistió el Cardenal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, Arzobispo de Lima y Primado de la Iglesia peruana.

== Compromisos ==
Fue comprometida en matrimonio con el príncipe Gustavo de Suecia, hijo del rey Erico XIV de Suecia y de Karin Månsdotter.

Sus principales amigos y colegas fueron asesinados después de los llamados ""arreglos"" por parte de agentes del gobierno de Plutarco Elías Calles; sin embargo Luis Rivero del Val continuó su trayectoria de líder como escritor e ingeniero civil de la UNAM (1932). El Ing. Del Val murió a principios de los 90 en la Cd. de Cuernavaca, Morelos, a lado de su esposa Ma. Cristina Iturbide de Rivero y sus hijos Maria Cristina, Isabel, Gloria, Luis, Emilio Francisco y Mauricio.

== Obra ==
Su obra más conocida es Entre las Patas de los Caballos, la que comenzó a escribir poco antes de enrolarse en las filas cristeras. En él se narran sucesos previos a la guerra y durante la lucha armada. Durante los años que pasó peleando como soldado escribió a modo de diario, relatando noticias de la época y describiendo las reacciones de la gente ante estas. El libro, por momentos, da la impresión de ser una novela de aventura.
Durante la guerra, se desplazó por varios estados de la República, por lo que la narración no solamente se limita a la capital mexicana, sino que abarca también el área del Bajío (México).
Su autobiográfico libro novelado ""¿Cuál justicia?"" narra el caso de un ingeniero que sufre graves afrentas a manos de una poderosa corporación dominada por un gerente que hábilmente lo calumnia y hace víctima de palmarias injusticias.

493,"La fabricación de aviones es un sector industrial importante en Rusia, da empleo a alrededor de 355.300 personas. El desmembramiento de la Unión Soviética sumergió a la industria en una profunda crisis, especialmente para el segmento de la aviación civil. La situación comenzó a mejorar hacia mediados de la primera década de los 2000 debido a un crecimiento en el transporte aéreo y a la creciente demanda. Un programa de consolidación iniciado en 2005 condujo a la creación del holding United Aircraft Corporation, que incluye la mayoría y más importantese empresas del sector.
La industria aeronáutica rusa ofrece una cartera de aviones militares competitivos a nivel internacional, tales como el MiG-29 y el Su-30, además de los nuevos proyectos como el Sukhoi Superjet 100 con los que se espera revivir el segmento de la aviación civil. En 2009, las empresas pertenecientes a la United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) entregó 95 nuevos aeroplanos a sus clientes, incluyendo 15 modelos civiles. Además, la industria produjo más de 141 helicópteros.


== Historia ==


=== Ajustes postsoviéticos ===

La industria aeroespacial estuvo bastante bien desarrollada en la Unión Soviética. A finales de los 80, la Unión Soviética representaba el 25% de la producción aeronáutica civil del planeta y el 40% de la producción de aviones militares.[2]​ Sin embargo las consecuencias de la disolución de la Unión Soviética en 1991 fueron catastróficas. El sector de la fabricación al completo fue devastado por las importaciones, mientras que las industrias aeroespacial y del automóvil apenas lograron sobrevivir debido a las altas tarifas proteccionistas.[3]​ En el lado positivo, la industria aeronáutica militar logró beneficiarse de la mejora de las oportunidades de exportación. Se benefició de un amplio stock de componentes y piezas que se habían producido durante la época soviética. La industria de la aviación civil se enfrentaría a algo mucho peor: mientras que en 1990 el país había producido 715 aviones civiles, en 1998 el número descendió a 54 y en 2000 solo 4 aviones civiles.[2]​
Como la estructura de la industria se encontraba fraccionada en productores independientes, el Gobierno de la Federación de Rusia estableció la necesidad de su consolidación. Para ello el presidente Boris Yeltsin creó la VPK MAPO (Military Industrial Complex - Moscow Aircraft Production Association; Complejo industrial militar - Asociación de productores aeronáuticos de Moscú), que incluía algunas empresas clave como Mikoyán. MAPO más tarde se convertiría en la Compañía aeronáutica rusa conocida por sus siglas en ruso ""MIG"". Esta etapa de consolidación no tuvo demasiado éxito por lo que la MAPO se fusionaría más tarde con Sukhoi.[4]​
La producción total de la industria aeroespacial en el año 2000 fue de 2,7 mil millones de USD, con un beneficio neto de 600 millones de USD. Las exportaciones de aviones militares durante el año 2000 ascendieron a 1,3 mil millones de USD.[2]​


=== 2000-2005: el inicio de una recuperación ===

En las puertas del milenio, la industria de la aviación civil se encontraba en una profunda crisis. Solo unos pocos aviones fueron construidos y el servicio post-venta inapreciable. Muchos aviones, tanto nuevos como antiguos, no consiguieron las certificaciones medioambientales ni de seguridad. Dos buques insignia de la aviación rusa, la Aviastar-SP y la Asociación de Producción de Aviones de Voronezh (VASO) casi fueron a la bancarrota. Los beneficios de la industria de la aviación civil apenas rozaron los 300 millones de USD en 2001. Entre 2001 y 2006 la situación empezó a mejorar considerablemente, ya que la industria comenzó a recibir nuevos pedidos de compañías de leasing. El transporte aéreo creció un 8% al año y en 2004 la demanda interna de nuevos aviones levantó el vuelo. Las principales empresas lograron pagar sus deudas o su reestructuración y los niveles de producción fueron aumentando una vez más.[5]​
La industria aeronáutica militar sobrevivió los 15 años de crisis casi exclusivamente a través de las exportaciones. Solo en 2005 la industria comenzó a recibir una financiación notable del presupuesto estatal.[6]​


=== 2005-2010: programa de consolidación de la industria ===

En 2005 el gobierno del presidente Vladimir Putin inició un programa de consolidación de la industria para que las principales compañías productoras se refugiaran bajo un mismo paraguas, la UAC. El objetivo era optimizar las líneas de producción y minimizar las pérdidas. El programa se dividió en tres partes: reorganización y gestión de la crisis (2007 a 2010), evolución de los proyectos en curso (2010 a 2015) y seguir avanzando dentro de la estructura de reciente creación (2015 a 2025).[7]​
La UAC, uno de los llamados adalides nacionales comparable a la EADS en Europa, contó con un apoyo financiero considerable por parte del gobierno ruso que inyectó en las empresas que había adquirido para mejorar su situación financiera. El primer presupuesto de la UAC en 2007 fue de unos 2 mil millones de rublos y el siguiente año aumentó hasta los 24 mil millones de rublos (unos 770 millones de USD).
Las entregas de aeronaves civiles aumentaron de 6 en 2005 a 15 en 2009, por un valor de 12,5 mil millones de rublos, en su mayoría clientes nacionales.[8]​
A pesar de la crisis financiera mundial, la industria de aviación rusa logró aumentar la producción y las ventas en un 19,5% en 2009.[9]​


=== Nuevos proyectos ===


==== Aviones de combate de quinta generación ====
En 1998, la Fuerza aérea rusa pidió a la industria que desarrollara un caza ligero multiproposito de primera línea. En 2001 la solicitud se amplió a todo un sistema de aviones multipropósito de primera línea, que acabaría concretandose en el caza de combate de quinta generación PAK-FA, considerado como la respuesta al programa americano Joint Strike Figther.[10]​ El Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA realizó su primer vuelo en 2010, rompiendo el monopolio total de los Estados Unidos en el desarrollo y la producción de aviones de quinta generación. La revista Moscow Defense Brief lo alabó como un gran salto para la industria aeronáutica rusa, diciendo que:
""aunque no es equiparable a Estados Unidos en términos militares, Rusia cuenta con un sólido segundo puesto en lo referente a tecnología defensiva, desbancando tanto a Europa occidental como a China y asestando un contundente golpe a su oponente de una categoría económica superior.""
Sin embargo, la revista también señaló que los graves obstáculos financieros y técnicos aun permanecían, lo que podría retrasar el programa de aviones a reacción de quinta generación o incluso detenerlo por completo.[11]​


==== Sukhoi Superjet 100 ====

El avión regional de pasajeros Sukhoi Superjet 100 es el primer gran avión civil ruso, cuyo desarrollo se inició después de 1991. El avión, que voló por primera vez en 2008, ha sido descrito como el programa de aviación civil más importante y exitoso de la industria aeroespacial rusa.[12]​ Diseñado por una filial de la UAC, Sukhoi, en cooperación con socios extranjeros, todas las versiones del avión son ensambladas por la planta KnAAPO en Komsomolsk del Amur (extremo oriente ruso), mientras que la planta NAPO de Novosibirsk se centra en la producción de componentes. Las dos compañías han estado invirtiendo fuertemente en la mejora de sus instalaciones y se espera que puedan producir 70 fuselajes para el año 2012.[12]​


==== MS-21 ====
El desarrollo del avión de pasajeros UAC MS-21 se inició en la década de 2000. El avión, que tiene una capacidad de 150-200 pasajeros y una autonomía de 5.000 km, está siendo diseñado por Irkut Corporation en cooperación con socios extranjeros. Está dirigido al segmento más popular de la industria de las aerolíneas nacionales y está destinado a reemplazar los aviones más antiguos como el Tupolev Tu-154. El programa se encuentra actualmente en la fase de diseño. El vuelo de inauguración del avión se espera que tenga lugar en 2017,[13]​ y las entregas comenzarán en 2019. Los desarrolladores pretenden vender entre 1.200 y 1.500 aviones en total, que asciende a una cuota del 12 al 15% del mercado internacional.[14]​


==== Otros proyectos ====
Otros aviones de reciente desarrollo incluyen el avión de entrenamiento avanzado y ataque ligero Yakovlev Yak-130, el avión militar de carga ligero Ilyushin Il-112 y el avión comercial de largo alcance COMAC C929 que UAC esta desarrollando en cooperación con la compañía China Comac. Así mismo, el productor ruso de aviones anfibios Beriev también tiene como objetivo la fabricación de nuevos diseños de aeronaves comerciales.


== Estructura ==

En 2008, la industria aeronáutica se componía de 106 empresas, de las cuales 18 pertenecían a UAC.[15]​ Una de las compañías de más éxito es Sukhoi,[16]​ que posee una amplia cartera de aviones militares competitivos a nivel internacional, incluyendo los modelos Su-30 y Su-35s. En el segmento civil, el proyecto más importante de la compañía es el Superjet 100.[4]​ KnAAPO, la mayor empresa de aviones de Rusia, es responsable de la fabricación de productos para Sukhoi.[17]​ Tupolev se centra en el mercado de la aviación civil con sus aviones Tu-204 y Tu-214, pero también es responsable de los bombarderos de largo alcance Tu-160 y del desarrollo de sus sucesores. La producción en masa de los aviones Tu-204 se lleva a cabo en la compañía Aviastar-SP, situada en Ulyanovsk, mientras que su variante el Tu-214 se produce en la Kazan Aviation Factory(KAPO).[17]​ Ilyushin se centra en los aviones militares de carga y los del sector del transporte de mercancías. Irkut Corporation tiene una cartera de proyectos aviones de entrenamiento y anfibios y además compite en el nicho de la electrónica de a bordo y de la aviónica.[4]​ En el segmento de vehículos aéreos no tripulados ZALA Aero y Vega Radio Engineering Corporation se encuentran entre las empresas líderes.


== Producción ==


=== La producción de aviones civiles ===


=== Aviones militares ===
En el segmento militar, las empresas pertenecientes a la UAC entregaron 84 nuevos aviones y conjuntos desarmados. Más de 60 aviones fueron modernizadas o se sometieron a revisión.[20]​


=== Helicópteros ===
En 2009 la industria aeronáutica rusa produjo 141 helicópteros, incluyendo un Mi-26, 130 Mi-8/Mi-17, 4 Ka-226 y 6 helicópteros de entrenamiento Ansat-U. La cifra no incluye los helicópteros de combate. Por lo tanto se ha calculado que el número total de helicópteros producidos es similar a los de 2008, cuando la cifra fue de 169.[18]​


=== Ingresos ===
Los ingresos de la industria aeronáutica por ventas durante el 2008 fueron de 226,6 mil millones de rublos (105,3 mil millones para la UAC), y la participación de las exportaciones fue del 29% (52,5% en el caso de la UAC).[21]​


== Repercusión económica ==

La industria rusa de aviación es uno de los pilares de la economía del país. Se trata de uno de los sectores punteros que da empleo a la mayoría del personal cualificado. La producción y el valor de la rama de aviación militar es muy superior a otros sectores de la industria armamentística y los productos de aviación representan más de la mitad de las exportaciones de armamento del país.[22]​


=== Empleo ===
Se calcula que en 2008 el número de empleados de la industria aeronáutica era de 355.300 personas.[15]​ UAC abarca la mayor parte de las empresas y las más importantes del sector, contaba con 97.500 empleados en 2009. De esta cantidad, 85.500 trabajaban en las fábricas de producción, 11.100 en las oficinas de diseño y 900 en la gestión y en empresas de leasing. La edad media del personal de producción de la UAC era de 44 años y 49 para el personal que trabajaba en las oficinas de diseño. La proporción de graduados de educación superior era del 34%.[15]​

495,"Josefa Monrabal Montaner (Gandía, 3 de junio de 1901 - Jeresa, 29 de agosto de 1936) fue una religiosa de las Religiosas de San José de Gerona beatificada en septiembre de 2015 en una ceremonia en la Catedral de Gerona.[1]​
Desde muy joven ayudaba a los pobres. En 1928 entró en el Instituto de Religiosas de San José, y fue enviada a la comunidad de Villarreal para tener cura de los enfermos. Arrestada en casa de su hermano, en Gandía, murió asesinada la noche del 29 al 30 de agosto de 1936 en Jeresa.[2]​


== Biografía ==
Josefa era hija de Vicente Monrabal Puig, natural de Gandía, y Clara Montaner Cháfer, de Ráfol de Salem. El matrimonio tuvo 4 hijos: Vicente, José María, Andrés y Joaquín (que murió a los cuatro días de nacer) y Josefa (Pepita para la familia). Sus padres, Vicente y Clara, eran cristianos de profundas creencias, que procuraron que sus hijos recibieran prontamente el bautismo y les procuraron la enseñanza de la doctrina cristiana como les aconsejaba el rector de la iglesia de San José a la cual pertenecían.
Josefa, ya desde pequeña, era muy piadosa y generosa. Los domingos por la mañana, después de ir a misa, tenía por costumbre ir a visitar a los enfermos del barrio y a otros que ella conocía. Conversaba con ellos, les asistía y se fijaba en la situación en que se encontraban para ayudarles, traerles un poco de ropa, medicinas, alimentos, etc. Durante las tardes frecuentaba el colegio de las Hermanas Carmelitas con otros jóvenes que allí acudían a pasar la tarde, pues Josefa sintió desde muy joven la vocación religiosa. Aunque no asistía a aquel colegio, admiraba la dedicación y entrega con que las religiosas atendían a las alumnas. Tenía la ilusión de ser también ella carmelita, pero su padre se oponía a su ingreso porque decía que la necesitaba.
El 4 de junio de 1927 llegaron a Gandía las Religiosas de San José para asistir a los enfermos en sus domicilios y se establecieron en la calle Vallier, cercana a la familia Monrabal.[3]​ La superiora era la madre Fidela Oller y vino acompañada por seis hermanas. La noticia de la llegada fue muy bien acogida por el pueblo, que las estaba esperando con ilusión desde hacía muchos años. Despacio, Josefa las fue conociendo y le impactó su sencillez y pobreza. El encuentro y amistad con las hermanas, que cada día se iba haciendo más profunda, fue un estímulo decisivo que la ayudó a comprender su vocación.
La amabilidad y proximidad de la madre Fidela, atrajo la atención de Josefa y entabló con ella una relación más personal. A Josefa le gustaba el servicio que las hermanas hacían con los enfermos y esto fue penetrando cada vez más en su interior hasta que comprendió que el Señor la llamaba para esta misión.
El 9 de marzo de 1928, debido a una hemorragia cerebral, el padre de Josefa murió. Josefa siguió viviendo con su madre viuda. Después de unos meses de la pérdida de su padre, su madre, Clara, animó a Josefa a que ingresara en la vida religiosa. En el mes de septiembre de 1928, Josefa ingresó en el Instituto de las Religiosas de San José en la ciudad de Gerona. Cumplido el tiempo reglamentario, el 18 de marzo de 1931 hizo su Primera Profesión y se trasladó a la comunidad de Villarreal. En esta comunidad permaneció cerca de tres años progresando en su vida de consagrada y dando gran ejemplo a todos. Su ideal era claro: la santidad.
La situación política de España se había ido deteriorando mucho a partir de 1931. En los inicios de 1936, se percibían manifestaciones de odio a lo religioso y a las instituciones eclesiásticas. Esta situación era cada vez mucho más fuerte y violenta, sobre todo en las ciudades y pueblos del Levante como Alicante, Gandía, Valencia, Villarreal, Castellón de la Plana y toda Cataluña. La madre Elena Campmol, superiora general del Instituto, ante la situación tan conflictiva, envió a las comunidades un comunicado en el cual autorizaba a las hermanas a poder irse con sus familias o a otros lugares seguros, hasta nuevo aviso, pues pensó que era la mejor manera de salvarles la vida. La hermana Josefa, que se encontraba en Castellón, decidió ir con su familia porque Gandía quedaba cerca. A los días decidió ir a vivir con la Madre Fidela Oller a casa de su hermano Vicente. Estuvieron refugiadas en esta casa durante tres días. Nunca la familia de Josefa ni la comunidad de Gandía supieron después quién las acusó o cómo supieron los milicianos el lugar de refugio de la madre Fidela, o qué caminos recorrieron para encontrarla.
La noche del 29 al 30 de agosto, se presentaron en la casa unos milicianos armados que las detuvieron y se las llevaron. El coche de los milicianos, que había seguido por la carretera en dirección a Valencia, al llegar al cruce con el camino de Jeresa, en el lugar denominado de la Creueta, pararon y las hicieron bajar. En aquel mismo lugar las mataron.[4]​


== Beatificación ==
Fue beatificada en la Catedral de Gerona, el 23 de enero 2015 junto a sus compañeras Fidela Oller y Facunda Margenat, también asesinadas por su condición religiosa.[2]​[5]​[6]​ La beatificación fue presidida por el cardenal Angelo Amato.[7]​

== Resumen ==
El capítulo comienza con Michael observando los movimientos del guardia de la torre que está frente su celda en Sona. Un nuevo recluso, Andrew Tyge ha entrado a Sona, y dice conocer a Whistler. Lincoln visita a Michael, la fecha límite de la fuga es hasta mañana. Lincoln programa un escape con un vehículo que esté a pocos metros de la prisión, exactamente a las 3pm. La única manera de evitar ser vistos por los militares en los jeeps de noche es escapar ahora a plena luz del día.
Michael le pide a McGrady un reloj y unos binoculares y comienza a esbozar su plan de escape con Whistler. Pero primero necesita reconocer los puntos débiles de los guardias que vigilan desde las torres de la cárcel. Whistler vigila todo el día a uno de ellos con una mitad de los binoculares.
Susan llama a Lincoln y le recuerda que tienen sólo 34 horas para que Michael ejecute el plan de escape.
El primo de Lechero, Augusto, acuerda con Sucre introducir contrabando a Sona, sólo una vez, a cambio de $5000.
Whistler dice que hay una hora del día en el cual el guardia tiene un punto ciego por 6 minutos. Mientras Michael observa que el otro guardia ha arreglado la antena del televisor que tiene en el puesto de vigilancia por unos segundos ya tres veces. El nuevo interno escucha lo que dicen, Mahone le advierte que es mejor que se ocupe de sus asuntos.
Lincoln y Sofía tratan de buscar un camino seguro cercano a Sona, pero son parados por varios policías que les ordenan salir de la vía ya que está prohibido el transito allí, por su cercanía a la cárcel.
T-Bag sigue vendiéndole su droga a Mahone. Sammy, el preso que sirve a Lechero, recoge el paquete que dejó Sucre entre unas cajas de comida que dejan los guardias a Sona.
Michael roba el microondas de uno de los presos y lo usa para completar su dispositivo de interferencias. Su plan funciona, pero el guardia afuera de Sona se da cuenta de algo sospechoso, creyendo que estaban apuntando un arma hacia él, comienza una balacera a la celda de Michael. La alarma de la prisión se activa, los internos corren hacia el patio y el Coronel Escamilla y sus hombres entran a la cárcel, en busca de un fusil de alcance que dice haber visto uno de los guardias, todos los presos arrodillados con las manos detrás de la cabeza, el Coronel dice que no se irán hasta que encuentren el arma.
Encuentran el monocular en la celda de Michael. El guardia le pregunta que hacia él viéndolo con eso, sin decir respuesta, lo golpea y le da un ultimátum, o confiesa que estaba haciendo o acciona el arma contra él. Pero, Whistler dice que el aparato es de él, le dice que no lo estaban vigilando, sino que estaba viendo aves y como prueba le enseña su libro de pájaros.
Cuando Lechero regresa a su habitación, la mujer con que se acuesta, Mary, le ha robado 30 dólares, él se molesta. Pero T-Bag le dice que ese dinero se lo dio él para el transporte y que el mismo lo repondrá al final de la jornada.
Lincoln compra algunos artículos en la tienda de buceo y va luego con Sofía a una playa cercana a la cárcel y donde entierra en la arena cuatro tanques de buceo. Uno para Michael, Sofía, Whistler y para él mismo.
Sucre recibe el dinero de Augusto y le ordenan hacerlo de nuevo. Sucre resiste a hacerlo otra vez, pero se ve forzado a hacerlo.
El plan de Michael se ve mermado, los guardias sellaron su celda, la misma por donde escaparían y donde tienen todos los recursos importantes para la fuga. Mahone le dice que él se ha dado cuenta que Hurtado, (el guardia de la torre frente a la celda), toma un breve descanso, exactamente a las 6pm y donde tarda unos segundos en tomarse una taza de café. El nuevo recluso, Tyge afirma conocer a Whistler, dice que lo conoció en Niza en 1997, con el Embajador, Whistler se pone nervioso y dice que lo ha confundido con alguna otra persona. Michael y Mahone sospechan ahora de Whistler.

509,"Jantipa (en griego Ξανθίππη Xanthíppē) fue la esposa de Sócrates y la madre de sus tres hijos Lamprocles, Sofronisco, y Menexeno. Jantipa significa en griego «caballo rubio», de ξανθός xanthós («rubio») y ἵππος híppos («caballo»).
Jantipa era probablemente mucho más joven que el filósofo, quizás unos cuarenta años. Por su supuesto mal carácter y por el despectivo modo en que trataba a su esposo ha pasado a la historia como insolente y feroz.[1]​


== Biografía ==
Existen pocas fuentes de primera mano acerca de Jantipa y su relación con Socrátes[2]​; su nombre apenas viene mecionado por Jenofonte y por Platón en el diálogo Fedón. En este último se narra como los discípulos de Sócrates lo encontraron en su celda junto a Jantipa, llevando en brazos a uno de sus hijos, en la manãna del día de su sentencia.[3]​
Considerando que Sócrates mismo tiene setenta años, que uno de los hijos tenía que ser llevado en brazos y que Lamprocles no debía de pasar de la pubertad, se puede deducir que Jantipa debía tener alrededor de treinta años cuando muere Sócrates.[4]​ Se puede anticipar una fecha tentativa de nacimiento alrededor del año 430 a. C. Esto es consistente con el hecho de que Jantipa no viene mencionada en la comedia Las nubes de Aristófanes del año 424 a. C., donde Sócrates mismo viene satirizado fuertemente.
Poco más se sabe acerca de la vida de Jantipa. Trazos de su carácter vienen sido inferidos básicamente a partir de algunas anécdotas referidas por Jenofonte. En sus Memorables (cap. 2.2), se narra como Lamprocles se queja de las reprimendas de su madre. Sócrates le hace ver la virtud de la gratitud, sobre todo cuando su madre no sólo le está bien dispuesta, sino que además ""lo cuida cuando está enfermo, cuida que no le falte nada y además reza a los dioses por él.""[5]​
Jenofonte mismo refiere otro tipo de anécdotas en el El banquete (cap. 2.10). Estas serán la fuente para autores posteriores respecto al supuesto carácter de Jantipa. En una de ellas Sócrates se encuentra en el banquete y observa a una pequeña malabarista. Al respecto comenta que también las mujeres pueden aprender todo lo que un hombre puede aprender. A la pregunta de por qué no ha conseguido entonces educar a Jantipa, Sócrates responde que es precisamente con los potros difíciles -una alusión al nombre de ella- que se entrena mejor.[6]​


== Referencias literarias ==
Diferentes autores y compiladores que trabajaron sobre Sócrates mencionaron también a Jantipa. Por lo general se basan en supuestas anécdotas que siguen un cierto patrón, semejante al usado por Jenofonte, en el cual se intenta poner la paciencia y virtud de Sócrates en prueba. Este conseguirá, usando las conocidas virtudes de equanimidad y juicio que ya se le venían atribuyendo en vida, superar la afrenta.
Por ejemplo, Plutarco refiere en Moralia, De capienda ex inimicis utilitate el mismo episodio del Banquete de Jenofonte.[7]​ Ya en el siglo III d. C., Diógenes Laercio narra en Vidas, opiniones y sentencias de los filósofos más ilustres una de las anécdotas más recogidas en los siglos posteriores: después de una fuerte discusión, Jantipa vacía un recipiente con agua sucia en la cabeza de Sócrates; sin perder la calma, Sócrates comenta que los truenos acaban en lluvia.[8]​
En el Renacimiento, con la vuelta en moda de figuras de la época clásica, el nombre de Jantipa viene usado como figura de una mujer de mal carácter, en parte como contrapeso a la figura del filósofo personificado en Sócrates. Por ejemplo, Erasmo de Róterdam, en el diálogo Conigium de sus Colloquia, describe a una esposa llamada Jantipa que recibe consejos de una amiga para tener menos problemas con el marido. Es posible que este sea uno de los textos de referencia usados por autores posteriores, entre ellos Shakespeare.[9]​
En la obra de Shakespeare La Fierecilla Domada, Petruchio compara a Caterina «como una Jantipa o peor» en Acto 1 escena 2. ([1])
También se la menciona en Los Cuentos de Canterbury de Geoffrey Chaucer concretamente en el prólogo del cuento de ""la Comadre de Bath"" (""The Wife of Bath's Prologue""). La narradora explica cómo su quinto marido, Jenkin, solía leerle un libro lleno de historias sobre mujeres infames, entre las que se encontraba la de Jantipa:

No se olvidó de ninguna de las penas y molestias que tuvo Sócrates con sus dos mujeres; de cómo Jantipa echó orina sobre su cabeza y el pobre hombre, sentado e inmóvil como un cadáver, secó su rostro sin atreverse a comentar más que esto: «Antes de que cese el trueno, cae la lluvia.»

511,"El goniobarímetro es un instrumento para pesar inventado por el ingeniero español Darío Bacas Montero, 1845-1913. Cilleros. (Cáceres). Con ese nombre (gonio-bari-metro: ángulo-peso-medida) quiso designar el ingeniero Bacas una báscula que indicara en una escala graduada, con divisiones igualmente espaciadas, un ángulo proporcional al peso a medir. Este hecho es común a muchos tipos de básculas. La originalidad del mecanismo del goniobarímetro es que, como veremos, se basa en las propiedades geométricas de la cicloide.


== Fundamento físico ==

El gráfico de la figura 1 es una representación esquemática del goniobarímetro. La báscula gira en torno al punto fijo O. El peso P que se quiere medir cuelga del punto B. En el otro brazo de la báscula y fijada rígidamente a él, la curva directriz ATH, guía el contrapeso Q, mediante un hilo enrollado en ella, que se va desenrollando a medida que la báscula se inclina, por la acción del peso P. E y E' son dos pequeños pesos desplazables, que equilibran el de la curva directriz y, su regulación, consigue que el centro de gravedad del dispositivo, cuando está libre de cargas, se sitúe exactamente en el punto O.
Para que la báscula haga honor a su nombre, la forma de la curva ATH ha de ser tal, que el sistema quede equilibrado justo en el momento en que el ángulo β, girado por el dispositivo, sea proporcional al peso P. Suponiendo que exista la curva que cumpla esta condición, la posición de equilibrio se dará cuando los torques respecto al punto O, de las cargas situadas a izquierda y derecha sean iguales, es decir:

  
    
      
        Q
        d
        (
        β
        )
        =
        P
        L
        cos
        ⁡
        β
        
        (
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Qd(\beta )=PL\cos \beta \qquad (1)}
  

donde L es la distancia desde O hasta B y d(β) es la distancia, entre el origen y la recta tangente a la directriz en el punto T, recta que viene físicamente realizada por el hilo, del que pende el contrapeso Q. El hecho de que el peso P haya de ser proporcional a β, que es el objetivo del goniobarímetro, transforma (1) en la ecuación:

  
    
      
        d
        (
        β
        )
        =

        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(\beta )=k\beta \cos \beta \quad \qquad (2)}
  

Donde k engloba todos los parámetros constantes.
El problema matemático del goniobarímetro se plantea entonces en los siguientes términos: hallar la forma matemática de la curva ATH para que la distancia desde el origen hasta la tangente en un punto T cualquiera, verifique la ecuación (2) siendo β el complementario del ángulo α que forma dicha tangente con el eje X. La curva directriz ATH, quedaría entonces definida por la envolvente de todas esas tangentes que se pueden formar cuando varía el ángulo β. A continuación se demuestra que esa curva directriz es la cicloide.
La tangente correspondiente al ángulo β, corta a los ejes en los puntos:

    {\displaystyle C\left({\frac {-d(\beta )}{\cos \beta }},0\right)\quad y\quad D\left(0,{\frac {-d(\beta )}{\operatorname {sen} \beta }}\right)}

Interpretamos esta última ecuación como la de un haz de rectas, parametrizado por β, tangentes todas ellas a la curva directriz cuya ecuación buscamos y que sería la envolvente de ese haz de rectas.< /p> Utilizando el procedimiento habitual para cálculo de envolventes, resolvemos el sistema formado por

donde se pueden reconocer las ecuaciones de la cicloide generada por una circunferencia de radio k/2 que rueda sobre la recta y = - k.
De esta manera se puede construir una báscula con contrapeso guiado tangencialmente por un arco de cicloide como la maqueta que se muestra en la fotografía de la figura 2, construida para uso didáctico.
Curiosamente, el ingeniero Bacas, en su patente, termina su cálculo de la directriz en las ecuaciones (4) Y (5) y al parecer no reconoce en ellas las de la cicloide, cuyo nombre no cita en ningún momento. No se entiende muy bien por qué. Tal vez no la reconoció o tal vez no lo consideró un asunto relevante a la hora de fabricar una báscula. Por otra parte, el modelo final que él proponía para la realización de su báscula no utilizaba la cicloide (directriz tangencial) sino una de sus evolventes, a la que apropiadamente llama directriz normal.

Para comprender este otro modelo de, fijémonos en la trayectoria que sigue en la figura 1 el contrapeso Q cuando el goniobarímetro, sometido a distintos pesos, se inclina con los ángulos correspondientes y supongamos que construimos un carril, rígidamente unido al astil, que fija esa trayectoria. Para un correcto funcionamiento de la báscula, tanto da que el contrapeso cuelgue de un hilo que se desenrolla de un arco de cicloide, como que ruede por un carril con la forma adecuada para que la posición del contrapeso respecto a la báscula sea la misma que cuando colgaba del hilo y por tanto produzca el mismo efecto dinámico. Se diseña así una nueva modalidad de goniobarímetro “con directriz normal” que su inventor describió con el esquema que vemos en la figura 3.

La barra AB gira en torno al punto O y sostiene en B el peso P que se quiere medir. Está, rígidamente unida, a un carril CH, por el que rueda el contrapeso Q. Los pequeños contrapesos deslizantes E, E´ del otro extremo de la barra, equilibran el peso del carril, situando el centro de gravedad del conjunto -sin las cargas Q y P- en el punto O. En esta situación, el carril CH actúa como guía y coloca al contrapeso Q, en relación con el dispositivo, en la misma situación en que estaría si colgara del hilo enrollado en torno a la cicloide. La distancia entre el punto O y la línea de acción del peso, es en todo instante la que equilibra al dispositivo en un ángulo β proporcional al peso P. Esta modalidad de goniobarímetro es completamente equivalente a la que ya hemos descrito.
El diseño de la forma del carril, puede hacerse teniendo en cuenta que su evoluta es la directriz tangencial. Puede obtenerse su forma analítica por los procedimientos habituales en cálculo o bien gráficamente, ajustando su trazado continuo por medio de su evoluta previamente construida, como describe su inventor en la patente por medio de la imagen de la figura 4.
La figura 5 muestra el prototipo de goniobarímetro que finalmente propuso su inventor. A efectos prácticos, el carril se ha diseñado como un tubo arqueado por el que rueda un contrapeso esférico. En la parte izquierda se aprecian dos contrapesos con posición variable en direcciones perpendiculares entre sí, que permiten situar el centro de gravedad de la parte móvil en el eje de giro. Los engranajes que se aprecian en la figura forman parte de un mecanismo de contabilidad que va acumulando los ángulos y por tanto los pesos. Esta acumulación de pesos es la que justifica que el limbo graduado tenga un giro completo aunque en cada pesada el goniobarímetro sólo se inclina como máximo 90 grados. Del extremo derecho de la barra colgaría el peso a medir.
Existen indicios de que el goniobarímetro se llegó a fabricar y usar. En el boletín oficial de Ceuta de 17 de julio de 1941, pág 6, se recoge el cuadro de tarifas que han de aplicar los inspectores de pesas y medidas para la revisión de diversos instrumentos para pesar, señalando entre ellos al goniobarímetro.
En nuestros días los mecanismos de este tipo de básculas son principalmente una curiosidad histórica y didáctica al haber sido superados, para efectos prácticos, por las básculas electrónicas. Pero este diseño sigue teniendo interés por algo que Darío Bacas al parecer o no sospechó o no juzgó interesante: el estar basado en una propiedad de la cicloide, curva que se creía completamente estudiada, pero que encerraba, al menos, una nueva sorpresa.

514,"Felipe Jiménez Mery (Chillán, Región del Biobío, Chile, 9 de octubre de 1960) es un jinete de rodeo chileno. El triunfo más destacado de este jinete fue el Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo de 1984, en donde fue campeón junto a Hugo Navarro.[1]​
A los 19 años abandonó su país y se fue a trabajar a Venezuela. Su sueño era juntar dinero y recuperar a Vanidoso, un potro que su padre le había vendido a Gonzalo Vial. Al cabo de tres años cumple su objetivo, vuelve a Chile, compra el potro y logra clasificar al Campeonato Nacional.[2]​
En ese campeonato hizo collera con Hugo Navarro. Montó a Vanidoso y su compañero a Auquincano. El campeonato fue muy disputado, incluso se fueron a desempate tres colleras, la de Miguel Lamoliatte y Daniel Rey y la de Ricardo de la Fuente y Enrique Schwalm. En el desempate la collera de Chillán fue la más efectiva, realizaron 5 puntos buenos y les alcanzó para quedarse con el título debido a los 2 puntos de Miguel Lamoliatte y Daniel Rey.
Este triunfo lo alcanzó con apenas 23 años y le comunicó a la prensa que “Me siento privilegiado de estar en la historia del rodeo. Soy el segundo jinete más joven de la historia en ganar un rodeo, la diferencia es que yo lo logré sin recursos”. Además de su compañero Hugo Navarro, que más que todo era su maestro dijo que “Navarro me enseñó que siendo humilde, tenaz en la vida, aunque no estén los recursos se puede ser campeón. Ese fue nuestro gran mérito”. Esas fueron las palabras a su compañero ya fallecido quien era el hermano de otro destacado jinete, Alfonso Navarro.
Al año siguiente logró otra gran actuación, alcanzano el vicecampeonato junto a Hugo Navarro. En 1991 logró un tercer lugar en el Campeonato Nacional, junto a Mauricio Toloza, en Fichero y Trago Largo.
Después de esas grandes campañas estuvo mucho tiempo fuera de las medialunas, dedicándose a la crianza. Sacó montas de su potro Causeo, criando buenos ejemplares como Regalado y Campesino, destacando también el caballo Canalla, campeón de la temporada 2007-2008, criado por Jiménez también.
Después vuelve a las pistas nacionales debido a la amistad que tenía con el fallecido polista chileno Gabriel Donoso. La gran habilidad que tenía este jinete para montar le trajo buenos resultados en el rodeo. Juntos corren una temporada completa. Lamentablemente Donoso muere en una trágica caída de su caballo jugando polo en Buenos Aires. Para Jiménez fue muy dura su partida, desea esperar lo que quedaba de la temporada y comenzó a correr junto con Francisco Infante y luego con Miguel Bravo, con quien disputó los clasificatorios al Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo de 2008. A partir de ese momento afirma que no aspira a grandes metas ya que cree que ya ganó todo en el rodeo y que actualmente corre solo por agrado.
En la temporada 2008-2009 corrió con Raúl Arraño, clasificando 2 colleras al Campeonato Nacional. En agosto de 2009 acordó correr la temporada 2009-2010 en uno de los criaderos más grandes de Chile, el Criadero Agua de los Campos y Mackena. Acollerado con el bicampeón chileno de rodeo, Rufino Hernández, han corrido 3 rodeos hasta la fecha teniendo excelentes resultados, siendo vice campeones en el primero y posteriormente campeones en los dos restantes.

518,"La Copa Mundial de Rugby de 2011 (IRB Rugby World Cup 2011™ en inglés) fue la VII Copa Mundial de Rugby. En la reunión de la World Rugby (WR), organismo rector del rugby internacional y organizador del evento, celebrada en Dublín el 17 de noviembre de 2005, fue seleccionada la candidatura de Nueva Zelanda para albergar el torneo. Los candidatos a organizar la copa del mundo fueron Japón, Sudáfrica y Nueva Zelanda. El consejo de la WR llevó a cabo dos rondas de votación para elegir el país anfitrión, siendo la candidatura sudafricana eliminada en primera ronda.
El torneo se desarrolló durante seis semanas a partir del 9 de septiembre, finalizando con la disputa de la final el 23 de octubre,[1]​ en el Eden Park de Auckland.[1]​
Los equipos participantes de este mundial al igual que en la Copa Mundial de Rugby de 2007 fueron 20. Los primeros clasificados fueron los tres primeros de cada grupo del anterior mundial. Estos equipos son: Argentina, Australia, Escocia, Fiyi, Francia, Gales, Inglaterra, Irlanda, Italia, Nueva Zelanda, Sudáfrica y Tonga. El cuadro se completó tras la disputa de las fases de clasificación regionales con las siguientes ocho selecciones: Canadá, Estados Unidos, Georgia, Japón, Namibia, Rumania, Rusia y Samoa.
La selección anfitriona, Nueva Zelanda, se alzó con la Copa Webb Ellis tras vencer en la final a Francia por 8 a 7, en una reedición de la primera final de 1987. Australia logró la medalla de bronce al derrotar a la selección de Gales en el partido por el tercer puesto.


== Elección de la sede ==

Nueva Zelanda organizó en 1987, conjuntamente con Australia la primera edición de la Copa Mundial de rugby. Asimismo, para la edición de 2003 estaba previsto que los partidos se disputaran en Nueva Zelanda y Australia, pero posteriores desacuerdos sobre los escenarios en los que se disputarían los partidos determinaron que Australia se convirtiese en sede única de aquella edición.
Tras la gira de los Leones Británico-irlandeses en 2005 varias voces críticas se alzaron contra la capacidad organizativa en términos de infraestructuras para acoger un evento de gran magnitud. Para hacer frente a estos posibles problemas, el proyecto de candidatura para 2011 contempló la ampliación del Eden Park de Auckland y otros estadios del país para lograr la viabilidad comercial y deportiva del evento.
Junto a la neozelandesa, Japón y Sudáfrica presentaron sendas candidaturas. De estas tres, Japón era la favorita para lograr la organización del torneo. A su favor, contaba con el hecho que en caso de ser elegida, sería la primera vez que el Mundial se disputaría en Asia, además del deseo explicito de la International Rugby Board (IRB) por organizar el torneo lejos de los grandes países en materia de rugby como eran Sudáfrica y Nueva Zelanda. Además la candidatura nipona presentaba una buena infraestructura, pues se contaba con los estadios construidos con motivo de la Copa del Mundo de Fútbol de 2002. Finalmente, Japón obtuvo en 2009 el encargo de organizar el torneo, pero en su novena edición, en 2019.
La candidatura sudafricana, respaldada por la exitosa organización de la Copa Mundial de 1995 y liderada por el ex-capitán Springbok, Francois Pienaar contó con un fuerte apoyo gubernamental, pero no consiguió la nominación.
El proyecto de Nueva Zelanda fue liderado por la Unión neozelandesa de rugby con el apoyo del gobierno del país, con el primer ministro y los jugadores de la selección, representados por su capitán, al frente.
En junio y julio de 2005 los comisarios de la IRB realizaron, tras su correspondiente visita, informes de cada una de los países candidatos. Finalmente, en la reunión anual de la IRB celebrada en Dublín el 17 de noviembre de 2005 se llevó a cabo la votación, por parte de los miembros de consejo. Se llevaron a cabo dos rondas: la candidatura sudafricana cayó eliminada en primera ronda, y tras la segunda ronda se anunció la adjudicación de la organización a Nueva Zelanda.


== Preparativos ==


=== Gastos y beneficios ===
Se presupuestó un gasto para el evento de unos 310 millones NZ$, además de unos ingresos por venta de entradas de 280 millones de dólares neozalandeses.[2]​ En Auckland, la ciudad donde se desarrollaron la mayor parte de los partidos importantes, los gastos para los contribuyentes neozelandeses se estiman en unos 102 millones de dólares.[3]​
En la venta de entradas se recaudaron unos NZ$285 millones, en alojamientos y similares alrededor de NZ$260 millones, y se ingresaron unos NZ$236 millones en concepto de comida y bebidas lo que generó un estímulo fiscal de casi el 1,4% del PIB trimestral.[4]​


=== Eventualidades ===
Durante el tiempo transcurrido entre la elección de la sede y el inicio del evento, los medios neozelandeses pusieron en entredicho la conveniencia de que fuese apropiado destinar el dinero público para infraestructuras deportivas, tal como ocurre en la mayoría de los eventos internacionales deportivos en la década reciente como por ejemplo los Juegos Olímpicos de Londres 2012,o el el Mundial de fútbol de Sudáfrica 2010. Hubo una gran controversia acerca de las obras de remodelación del Eden Park de Auckland a fin de adaptarlo a los requisitos de la IRB ya que debería tener una capacidad mínima de 60.000 localidades.[5]​
Un informe de julio de 2009 de la Autoridad Regional de Transportes de Auckland, advirtió sobre la falta de preparación y la complacencia existentes, a pesar de que los requisitos de transportes e infraestructuras requeridos para este tipo de eventos no se hubiesen alcanzado todavía.""[6]​ El informe fue rechazado por Michael Barnett, el jefe de la Cámara de Comercio de Auckland y co-ordinador de la planificación de los acontecimientos referentes a la Copa del Mundo en Auckland, alegando que se había recurrido a una informe anticuado.[7]​
El principal sindicato de la hostelería, que representa al 25% de los trabajadores de hoteles, restaurantes y casinos de Nueva Zelanda; exigió un reparto proporcional con los trabajadores en las ganancias generadas de forma extraordinaria durante el evento, amenazando incluso con la convocatoria de una huelga durante el torneo.[8]​
Las obras del Forsyth Barr Stadium de Dunedin, llamado durante el torneo Otago Stadium, fue una fuente de conflictos puesto que el proyecto se estaba desarrollando en unos plazos de tiempo muy ajustados. Un informe de abril de 2010 sobre el progreso del proyecto desveló que se estaban cumpliendo los objetivos para la Copa del Mundo, sin embargo existía algún que otro riesgo de que no se pudiese llegar a tiempo para el evento.[9]​ Si no se llegasen a cumplir los plazos establecidos, la organización tenía reservado el estadio Carisbrook, un antiguo estadio de Rugby de Dunedin. El Forsyth Bar Stadium fue inaugurado oficialmente el 6 de agosto de 2011.[10]​
Los desperfectos causados por el Terremoto de Christchurch de 2011 obligaron a recolocar una serie de partidos, incluido algunos de cuartos de final.[11]​


=== Partidos de preparación ===
Para Australia, Sudáfrica y Nueva Zelanda, el Torneo de las Tres Naciones 2011, que en esta edición redujo sus partidos disputados a seis, en vez de los nueve habituales, sirvió como preparación principal para el Mundial. En el hemisferio norte, una serie de amistosos disputados en agosto de 2011, reemplazó las habituales giras anuales hacia el hemisferio sur.


== Equipos participantes ==

Veinte equipos disputaron en el Mundial de Rugby 2011 el título de campeón del mundo de rugby. Doce selecciones se clasificaron automáticamente para esta competición al haber finalizado al menos en tercer lugar durante la disputa de la fase de grupos de la copa Mundial de Rugby de 2007.[12]​[13]​ Las otras ocho naciones se clasificaron para la Copa del Mundo a través de las fases de clasificación regionales y del play-off. La vigésima y última plaza para la copa del Mundo la obtuvo el ganador de la repesca entre Rumania y Uruguay disputada el 13 y el 27 de noviembre de 2010.[14]​
En cursiva, el debutante en la Copa Mundial de Rugby.


== Sedes ==
Las trece sedes originales para la Copa Mundial de Rugby de 2011 fueron confirmadas el 12 de marzo de 2009.[15]​ Sin embargo, tras el terremoto que afectó a la ciudad de Christchurch en febrero de 2011, ésta fue retirada y los partidos que se jugaban en ella reubicados en otras sedes.[16]​


== Balón oficial ==

El balón oficial de la copa del Mundo de rugby 2011 fue diseñado por la marca deportiva especializada en productos de rugby Gilbert. Recibió el apodo de «Virtuo»,[17]​ y fue presentado oficialmente por Gilbert en Auckland en el mes de mayo de 2011. Se trata de un balón realizado especialmente para este torneo. Su presentación se produjo después de un largo periodo de pruebas y estudios en varios partidos internacionales, entre ellos los del Torneo de las Seis Naciones 2011 y los test matches de otoño de 2011. El balón Virtuo fue concebido para ser más eficaz, mediante una válvula diferente y un novedoso ajuste de la vejiga del balón destinados a mantener la forma del balón y a facilitar el giro de la pelota.
A lo largo de la fase de grupos del torneo, la calidad del balón fue puesta de duda a causa de un notable descenso en el porcentaje de acierto por parte de los pateadores de las distintas selecciones.[18]​ Después de la disputa de una veintena de partidos de la primera fase, el porcentaje medio de éxito superaba por poco el 60%. Solo el 56% de los tiros a palos se transformaban, lo representa un porcentaje inferior al de ediciones previas. La compañía, Gilbert, salió al paso de estas acusaciones, desmintiendo el efecto del balón y achacando los pobres datos porcentuales a las condiciones climáticas bajo las que se desarrolló la copa del Mundo.
En relación con los problemas en los tiros a palos, aconteció un hecho polémico que la prensa internacional bautizó como Ballgate.[19]​ Ante la falta de acierto con el pie del apertura de la selección inglesa, Jonny Wilkinson, dos técnicos cambiaron el balón por otro no oficial antes de los tiros a palos en el partido que Inglaterra disputó contra Rumanía. En ese partido el porcentaje de acierto de Wilkinson pasó de una media del 50% en partidos previos a casi un 70%. Se trataba de un hecho ilegal, por el que la International Rugby Board abrió una investigación, aunque la Rugby Football Union se adelantó a las posibles sanciones e impuso una suspensión a los técnicos que llevaron a cabo los cambios.


== Árbitros ==
El viernes 8 de abril de 2011, la WR nombró a los diez árbitros, siete asistentes arbitrales y cuatro jueces de televisión que participarán en la fase de grupos del torneo. Además, dos de los siete asistentes cumplirán funciones de árbitro suplente.


== Ceremonia de inauguración ==

La ceremonia de apertura de la Copa Mundial de Rugby de 2011 tuvo lugar el 9 de septiembre en el estadio Eden Park de Auckland como acto previo al partido inical del torneo que enfrentó a Nueva Zelanda y Tonga. Tuvo comienzo a las 19:30, hora local, y se desarrolló durante algo menos de treinta minutos, poniendo en escena a más de cien personas, entre actores y cantantes.
El hilo argumental de la ceremonia constó de distintas partes diferenciadas que homenajearon los orígenes del rugby y de la cultura neozelandesa. Tras una cuenta atrás dio comienzo la primera, con el título la llamada, puso en escena la separación de cielo y la tierra, de donde surge la luz. Un hechizo maori surge de Nueva Zelanda y desde un gran mapa con las dos islas, Te Ika un Maui y Te wai pounamu, se dirige hacia los distintos países participantes en el torneo, reclamando a sus habitantes que atraviesen el mundo para encontrarse en Nueva Zelanda, una invitación a conocer la cultura neocelandesa. En la segunda parte, el viaje, los pueblos del mundo se reúnen de Nueva Zelanda, representados por ocho pequeñas barcas. En la siguiente escena, se escenifica la fuerza de los tiburones, en ella figuras humanas representando dos de estos animales se enfrentan en una especie de melé submarina gigante. Seguidamente, una especie de haka interpretada por una treintena de actores maoríes es realizada sobre la proyección del cráter de un volcán.
En la siguiente parte, aparece una pequeña porción de un campo de rugby, sobre el que un joven vestido con un polo con los colores del equipo de Christchurch, rojo y negro, y el dorsal 11 a la espalda realiza un ensayo con un balón con el logotipo del mundial. A continuación, le rodean unos cincuenta contrincantes a los que, balón en mano, acaba superando. Seguidamente una explosión eleva al mismo joven al cielo, al encuentro de un balón gigante que ilumina el estadio. Sobre el suelo, van apareciendo los nombres de antiguos grandes jugadores que han disputado el torneo desde su creación en 1987. En un extremo de la proyección hace su aparición el ex-All Black Jonah Lomu, que apunta la aparición en el campo de una gran réplica de la copa Webb Ellis.
Bajo esta réplica es interpretada la canción oficial de la Copa del Mundo de rugby desde 1991, World in Union interpretada por Ria Hall y Evander Folau. Finalmente, tuvieron lugar los actos protocolarios, con la intervención del primer ministro de Nueva Zelanda, John Key y el presidente de la International Rugby Board, Bernard Lapasset, que inauguró oficialmente la Copa del Mundo 2011.
El acto final tuvo lugar en las calles de Auckland con un gran espectáculo de fuegos artificiales y música que representó a todas las culturas del país.


== Primera Fase ==
Durante la fase de grupos, las 20 selecciones clasificadas fueron divididas en cuatro grupos de cinco equipos cada una, en el sorteo que tuvo lugar en Londres en noviembre de 2008. Durante esta parte del torneo los equipos disputaron una liguilla clasificatoria en la que las selecciones jugaron todas contra todas dentro de cada grupo, una vez. De tal manera que se disputaron 10 partidos por grupo, es decir, 40 encuentros en total durante esta fase.
El sistema de puntuación para cada partido fue el siguiente:
Se otorgaron cuatro puntos por partido ganado.
Dos puntos por empate.
Ningún punto para el perdedor
Un punto extra por anotar cuatro o más Tries.
Un punto extra por perder por siete puntos o menos.
A la finalización de esta fase, los equipos de cada grupo fueron clasificados de uno a cinco sobre la base de los puntos obtenidos en sus 4 partidos correspondientes. Si en último término, dos o más equipos hubiesen quedado igualados en puntos, se habrían aplicado, en orden, los siguientes criterios hasta que una de las selecciones fuera declarada como la mejor clasificada:
La selección ganadora del partido entre los dos equipos implicados
El equipo con la más amplia diferencia entre puntos a favor y puntos en contra en todos los partidos del grupo
El equipo que tenga la mejor diferencia entre ensayos a favor y en contra en todos los partidos de su grupo

== Fase final ==

Finalizada la fase de grupos, los dos primeros equipos de cada grupo pasaron a los cuartos de final del torneo, que consistieron en partidos eliminatorios. Los equipos que ganaron los partidos de cuartos de final se clasificaron para las semifinales, y los equipos que perdieron los partidos de cuartos de final fueron eliminados del Mundial.
Los partidos de semifinales también consistieron en partidos eliminatorios. Los ganadores de los partidos semifinales se clasificaron para la Final de la Copa del Mundo, y los perdedores de las semifinales disputaron la final de Bronce.
Durante la fase final del torneo, si los equipos hubiesen terminado empatados a la finalización del partido, el ganador se habría determinado mediante los siguientes criterios secuenciales:
Prórroga: se disputarían dos periodos extra de 10 minutos cada uno.
Muerte súbita: si el resultado continuara empatado tras disputarse los 20 minutos extra, se jugaría un tiempo extra adicional de 10 minutos como máximo. Durante este período el primer equipo que hubiese marcado puntos habría sido declarado ganador.
Competición de kicks: si después de este período de muerte súbita no se pudiera declararse un ganador, se habría organizado una competición de kicks desde el suelo entre los dos equipos. El ganador de esa competición habría sido ganador del partido.[21]​

== Celebraciones ==

La final de la copa del mundo 2011 se convirtió en el evento televisivo más visto de la historia de Nueva Zelanda con 2.036.900 espectadores. Mientras, la semifinal entre Nueva Zelanda y Australia y el partido inaugural se colocaron como el segundo y tercero respectivamente.[22]​
Tras la victoria de los All Blacks, cientos de miles de neozelandeses celebraron en la calle la victoria de su equipo.[23]​ En los días sucesivos se organizaron tres masivos desfiles en Auckland el 24 de octubre, Christchurch el 25 y finalmente Wellington el 26 de octubre, en el que se congregaron más de 150.000 personas. En Wellington tuvo lugar el acto oficial de recepción a los campeones en el parlamento de Nueva Zelanda donde fueron recibidos por el primer ministro John Key.[24]​
En total, las autoridades calcularon que más de medio millón de neozelandeses tomaron parte en las celebraciones por la consecución de la copa del mundo de rugby.[25]​ Las celebraciones continuaron posteriormente a los tres grandes eventos, con actos de menor envergadura en poblaciones más pequeñas del país.

521,"Rafael Canarozzo más conocido como Rafael Canaro (San José de Mayo, República Oriental del Uruguay; 22 de junio de 1890 - Mar del Plata; Buenos Aires, Argentina; 28 de enero de 1972) fue un reconocido músico, director de orquesta y compositor uruguayo nacionalizado en Argentina. Era el hermano menor del también director Francisco Canaro (1888 —1964).


== Carrera ==
Hijo de un matrimonio italiano conformado por Don Francisco Canaro (padre), de profesión sepulturero, y Doña Rafaela Gatto, desde muy temprana edad la familia de Canaro se instaló en Buenos Aires en 1897, donde vivieron en casas de inquilinato (llamadas conventillos), en condiciones de extrema pobreza. Radicado en el barrio Sán Cristóbal, antes de cumplir los diez años él trabajaba en las calles. Rafael Canaro se crió en una familia de artistas ligados al género del tango. Entre ellos se encontraban su otro hermano el cantor Juan Canaro y el pianista y compositor Humberto Canaro.
En 1905, mientras Francisco Canaro había adoptado el violín, Rafael se desempeñaba como guitarrista acompañante de payadores.
Se inició como músico en la orquesta de su hermano Francisco en 1925 haciendo giras por París, específicamente como contrabajista y en serrucho. En el grupo también estaban Fioravanti De Cicco (piano), Romualdo Lomoro (batería) y Asprela (canto y guitarra).[1]​

En 1926 viaja a Nueva York con la misma compañía y al cabo de esa gira vuelve a Francia donde capitanea orquesta propia hasta 1939 que por causas de la guerra retorna a Buenos Aires, luego de recorrer toda Europa, con elementos criollos y europeos que se convirtieron al tango, y el Medio Oriente.[2]​
En el viejo mundo tuvo en su orquesta como vocalistas a las figuras del canto español Carmen Sevilla y Luis Mariano, y de los locales famosos de la Villa Lumière en que actuó se cuentan Ambassadeurs, Florida, Ermitage, Claridge y grabó discos en la Odeón de Francia. En el mes de mayo de 1929 debuta en el Teatro Empire de París teniendo como principal estribillista al cantor Carlos Dante. En Niza tiene ocasión de tocar en un programa junto a Carlos Gardel, y luego viaja a Alemania y España. En este país su orquesta efectúa grabaciones para Regal (una subsidiaria de la poderosa Columbia).[3]​
Compuso junto a su hermano Franscisco y con letra de Juan Andrés Caruso el tango Sentimiento gaucho, tema que se hizo muy popular y se mantuvo vigente por varias décadas. Por ello fue premiado en el primer concurso de tangos de los discos ""Nacional"" a fines de 1924 con el primer premio.
Estuvo unido a Carlos Gardel por sincera y leal amistad compartida en París, Madrid y en cualquier otra parte que se encontraran.

En 1941, trabajó con el rubro José Tinelli- Chola Bosch, compartieron un exitoso programa en LR6 Radio Mitre, junto a la popular cancionista Adhelma Falcón.
Por su orquesta pasaron figuras como los vocalista Aldo Campoamor, Héctor María Artola, Mario Beltrán, Ricardo Duarte, Raúl Sanders, Luis Scalon, Alberto Tagle, Luis Mariano y Jorge Cardoso. El prestigioso músico Lucio Demare también formó parte de su orquesta típica.

525,"Apolonio de Perge, Apolonio de Perga o Apolonio de Pérgamo (Griego antiguo: Ἀπολλώνιος) (Perge, c. 262 - Alejandría, c. 190 a. C.) fue un geómetra griego famoso por su obra Sobre las secciones cónicas. Él fue quien dio el nombre de elipse, parábola e hipérbola, a las figuras que conocemos. Logró solucionar la ecuación general de segundo grado por medio de la geometría cónica.[1]​
También se le atribuye la hipótesis de las órbitas excéntricas o teoría de los epiciclos para intentar explicar el movimiento aparente de los planetas y de la velocidad variable de la Luna.
Sus extensos trabajos sobre geometría tratan de las secciones cónicas y de las curvas planas y la cuadratura de sus áreas.[2]​ Recopiló su obra en ocho libros y fue conocido con el sobrenombre de El Gran Geómetra.[3]​


== Biografía ==
Nació alrededor del 262 en la ciudad de Pérgamo (Turquía) y falleció alrededor del 190 A.C en Alejandría, Egipto.
Se sabe que estuvo en su casa durante los reinados de Ptolomeo Evergetes y Ptolomeo Filopater, a la vez que fue tesorero general de Ptolomeo Filadelfo. Por las fuentes se puede afirmar que era entre veinticinco y cuarenta años más joven que Arquímedes, de allí la estimación de sus años de nacimiento y muerte. Fuera de ello, lo poco que se sabe de su vida es que estudió en Alejandría y en esta ciudad se dedicó a la enseñanza


== Obra ==
Estudió las secciones cónicas utilizando como herramienta las proporciones, relacionando las magnitudes de cada elemento que conforman cada sección cónica en el caso de la parábola, elipse e hipérbola donde utilizó este método para definir las propiedades de cada corte con el cono, como lo demuestra Heath (1896), además propuso y resolvió el problema de hallar las circunferencias tangentes a tres círculos dados, conocido como problema de Apolonio. El problema aparece en su obra, hoy perdida, Las Tangencias o Los Contactos, conocida gracias a Pappus de Alejandría. Respecto a sus obras, se han perdido muchas:
Reparto rápido (Ὠκυτόκιον), en el que se enseñaban métodos rápidos de cálculo y se daba una aproximación del número π
Secciones en una razón dada (Λόγου ἀποτομή, De Rationis Sectione) , trataba sobre los problemas derivados de trazar una recta que pase por un punto dado y que corte a otras dos rectas dadas en segmentos (medidos desde sendos puntos situados en dichas rectas) que estén en una razón dada (este problema es equivalente a resolver la ecuación
  
    
      
        a
        x
        −

        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle ax-x^{2}=bc}
  )
Secciones en un área dada (Χωρίου ἀποτομή, De Spatii Sectione), problema parecido al anterior, pero ahora se pide que los segmentos determinados por las intersecciones formen un rectángulo equivalente a otro (este problema es equivalente a resolver la ecuación
  
    
      
        a
        x
        +

        =
        b
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle ax+x^{2}=bc}
  )
Secciones determinadas (Διωρισμένη τομή, De Sectione Determinata), dados cuatro puntos A, B, C, D, sobre una recta, encontrar un quinto punto P, tal que el rectángulo construido sobre AP y CP esté en una razón dada con el rectángulo construido sobre BP y DP
Tangencias (Ἐπαφαί, De Tactionibus), resuelve los problemas de construir una circunferencia tangente a tres elementos cualesquiera elegidos entre un punto, una recta y una circunferencia (este problema se conoce como el problema de Apolonio)
Lugares planos (Τόποι ἐπίπεδοι, De Locis Planis), los griegos clasificaban las curvas en tres tipos: lugares planos, eran las rectas y las circunferencias, lugares sólidos eran las secciones cónicas y lugares lineales el resto de las curvas; Inclinaciones, trataba del problema de trazar una circunferencia dada una cuerda de longitud dada pasando por un punto dado.
Sólo dos obras de Apolonio han llegado hasta nuestros días: Secciones en una razón dada (no se conserva el original sino una traducción al árabe) y Las Cónicas (sólo se conserva el original de la mitad de la obra, el resto es una traducción al árabe). Esta última es la obra más importante de Apolonio, es más, junto con los Elementos de Euclides es uno de los libros más importantes de matemáticas.

Las Cónicas está formado por 8 libros. Fue escrito cuando Apolonio estaba en Alejandría pero posteriormente, ya en Pérgamo (hoy Bergama en Turquía), lo mejoró.
El libro I: trata de las propiedades fundamentales de estas curvas.
El libro II trata de los diámetros conjugados y de las tangentes de estas curvas.
El libro III: trata de los tipos de conos.
El libro IV: trata de las maneras en que pueden cortarse las secciones de conos.
El libro V: estudia segmentos máximos y mínimos trazados respecto a una cónica.
El libro VI: trata sobre cónicas semejantes.
El libro VII: trata sobre los diámetros conjugados.
El libro VIII: se ha perdido, se cree que era un apéndice.
Los métodos que utiliza Apolonio (uso de rectas como sistemas de referencia) son muy parecidos a los utilizados por Descartes en su Geometría y se considera una anticipación de la Geometría analítica actual. De hecho ya utilizaba las coordenadas rectangulares. Con ayuda de estas, Apolonio definió curvas que eran bien conocidas en su tiempo: la parábola, la hipérbola y la elipse mediante las ecuaciones:
y2 = px ( parábola)
y 2 = px + p/a x2 (hipérbola)
y 2 = px - p/a x2 (elipse) donde p y a son números positivos .[4]​

== Recepción ==

Just Dance recibió bastantes criticas negativas,, con una calificación promedio de 49 sobre 100 en la web Metacritic.[1]​
Los aspectos que señalaron como ""deficientes"" en el juego, eran el sistema de detección de movimiento, los controles y el sistema de clasificación. También opinaron que se deberían crear canciones desbloqueables, lo cual se llevó a cabo a partir del juego siguiente.
Sin embargo, a nivel de ventas, Just Dance consiguió récords de ventas en Reino Unido en abril de 2010, con ventas que alcanzan los 2.000.000.[2]​ siendo así, la serie de danza más vendida de la historia. Además, es el videojuego de Ubisoft para Wii de mayor éxito. En diciembre de 2010, Just Dance había vendido 4,3 millones en todo el mundo.
Es un juego de baile hecho para todos los públicos, en el cual no es necesario ningún tipo de accesorio y cualquiera puede manejar el juego gracias a los controles instintivos del mando de Wii. Con dicho juego se pueden aprender movimientos de años atrás como de los 80, los 90 y de la actualidad. Además, consta de diferentes tipos de música como la música disco, rock, pop, etc… [3]​

527,"Monseñor Salvador Herrera Pinto, OFM (Abancay, Perú, 3 de febrero de 1890-Lima, Perú, 26 de enero de 1977) fue un obispo, sacerdote de la Orden de los Frailes Menores (franciscano), Doctor en Teología, políglota y escritor.


== Reseña biográfica ==


=== Nacimiento y primera formación ===
Salvador Herrera Pinto nació el 3 de febrero de 1890, en la ciudad de Abancay, departamento de Apurímac, Perú, siendo sus padres Rufino Herrera y Josefa Pinto. Don Rufino Herrera fue parlamentario por la provincia de Aymaraes en la época de los presidentes Andrés Avelino Cáceres y Nicolás de Piérola.
Desde muy niño sintió la vocación sacerdotal e ingresó en 1902 al convento de la Recoleta del Cusco. El 23 de abril de 1908 hizo profesión de votos y el 2 de mayo de 1911 cumplió los votos solemnes de la Orden Franciscana. El 28 de octubre de 1914 se ordenó de sacerdote en la ciudad de Arequipa, recibiendo las respectivas Órdenes de manos del famoso orador y obispo franciscano Monseñor Mariano Holguín. Celebró su primera misa el 8 de noviembre de 1914 en la ciudad de Arequipa siendo que para su segunda misa viajó a su tierra natal, Abancay, donde la celebró el 17 de enero de 1915.[1]​


=== Educación en Europa ===
Su destacado paso por los seminarios de formación franciscana y su dominio de idiomas lo condujeron a Europa, tomado cursos en la Universidad Católica de Lovaina (Bélgica) y la Universidad de Friburgo en Suiza de donde se recibió como Doctor en Teología en el año 1920. Viajó por Italia siendo recibido en Roma por su Santidad el Papa Benedicto XV. Luego de doctorarse continuó su estancia en Europa en pos de realizarse y estudiar el griego, hebreo y latín. Pasó a Alemania con el objeto de continuar sus estudios y aprender el alemán, lugar en el que fue testigo excepcional de las consecuencias de la derrota alemana en la Primera Guerra Mundial y la caída de la República de Weimar y del surgimiento de Adolfo Hitler y el nazismo; presenció las primeras persecuciones a la Iglesia y sus organizaciones de base que precedieron a la infame Noche de los Cuchillos Largos. Siendo insostenible su presencia en la convulsa Alemania, el papa Pío XI, el 21 de diciembre de 1933, lo designa Obispo Titular de la Diócesis de Puno, siendo consagrado para el efecto el 20 de mayo de 1934 y tomando posesión de su sede episcopal el 31 de mayo del mismo año.[2]​


=== Obispo de Puno ===

En su calidad de Obispo de Puno fue Secretario General de la Conferencia Episcopal Peruana para los períodos 1934-1935 y 1935-1936.[3]​ En 1935 fue partícipe destacado del Primer Congreso Eucarístico Nacional realizado en la ciudad de Lima.
Fue un notable políglota, conocedor tanto de lenguas clásicas (griego, hebreo y latín), modernas (inglés, francés, italiano, alemán) como andinas (quechua, aymara), elevando siempre la riqueza del idioma quechua, que aprendió desde su niñez en su natal Apurímac. Su oratoria denotaba su amplia cultura siendo a la vez atrayente y fervorosa.
Son muchas las obras dejadas por Monseñor Herrera tanto en Puno como en Apurímac, especialmente a favor de los pobres y necesitados de estos departamentos deprimidos y olvidados. Sin embargo, su obra más destacada fue su auxilio en la persecución nazi a las religiosas alemanas de la Orden de Santa María Magdalena de Speyer (a quienes se les había confiscado y expropiado sus obras educativas y sus bienes),[4]​ gestionando con sus propios medios su traslado a la ciudad de Abancay en el año de 1938 y apoyándolas en la fundación del colegio “Santa Rosa”, institución hoy emblemática de la ciudad.[5]​ Fue su intención fundar un convento franciscano en Abancay para lo cual realizó gestiones y colectas logrando adquirir dos terrenos que luego fueron traspasados a la Diócesis de Abancay que construyó en uno de ellos el actual Seminario Menor mientras que el otro se destinó a la granja de producción agrícola ""San Francisco"".
El 5 de abril de 1948, cesó en el cargo de Obispo de Puno y fue honoríficamente nombrado Obispo Titular de la Diócesis de Satala en Armenia (hoy Turquía)[6]​


=== Últimos años ===
En 1953 fue designado presidente del Comité pro-Coronación Pontificia de la Virgen del Milagro en Lima, coronación que fue hecha por el Nuncio Apostólico Monseñor Fernando Cento por encargo de su santidad el papa Pío XII.[7]​
En 1966 publica el libro ""La cuna de Ricardo Palma"" obra que sería su mayor contribución académica, y por la que es muy reconocido, donde cuestiona la afirmación documentaria de que el escritor tradicionalista haya nacido en Lima. Sus últimos años los pasó en oración y comunidad con sus hermanos franciscanos en el Convento de los Descalzos en Lima. Entregó su alma al Señor el 26 de enero de 1977.


== ""La Cuna de Ricardo Palma"": la validez de la tradición oral frente a la prueba documental ==

La conexión entre Ricardo Palma y Apurímac radica en una de sus famosas tradiciones[8]​ titulada “Por beber en copa de oro”[9]​ que se sitúa en el pueblo de Tintay de la provincia de Aymaraes, un pueblo muy cercano a Monseñor Herrera, quien se habría preguntado cómo así Palma sabía de Tintay, en una época en la que Apurímac, por su distancia e inaccesible geografía, era muy aislada del Perú como para que alguien foráneo, supuestamente de la costa, la describa tan exactamente (como casi un siglo después lo hizo muy bien José María Arguedas).[10]​
Esta pregunta, ha de haber rondado la cabeza de Monseñor Herrera pues durante mucho tiempo anduvo recogiendo testimonios de gente que afirmaba que Ricardo Palma habría nacido en el pueblo de Talavera de la provincia de Andahuaylas.
“La cuna de Ricardo Palma” recoge y pone en valor estos testimonios orales frente a las pruebas documentales que afirman el origen limeño de Ricardo Palma, demostrando las inconsistencias de éstas y explicándolas por la costumbre, tan peruana de la época, rezago de la colonia, del “blanqueamiento” o de hacer aparecer en documentos un lugar de nacimiento lo más cercano a la ciudad principal ""de blancos"" y lo más lejano de las zonas indias, en donde el mestizaje era lo común.
El ocultar su origen serrano y provinciano era particularmente importante para Palma quien, desde muy joven, se vio enfrascado en pleitos de origen comercial, a razón de la actividad de su padre,[11]​ que se saldaban mediante ""comunicados"" en diarios como ""El Comercio"" donde se mancillaban honras y publicaban adjetivos contra el adversario de entre los que, sin duda, los que recordaban la cuna, eran de especial calibre;[12]​ unos pleitos que para Palma se trasladaron luego al ámbito literario ya que él fue objeto de las diatribas de Manuel Gonzáles Prada quien no dudó en enrostrarle su origen mestizo; una razón suficiente, sin duda, para la época, para ocultar su verdadera cuna.[13]​
Monseñor Herrera cuestiona la teoría tradicional de que Palma sea limeño porque ella está basada en la mera afirmación del escritor, quien en vida no señaló arraigo en Lima, lo cual abona la teoría que era un foráneo a ésta ciudad, así como las conclusiones del historiador Raúl Porras Barrenechea quien, según dice, encontró una partida de nacimiento de un tal Manuel Palma; cuestionando la primera porque Palma ha afirmado varias cunas, entre ellas Arequipa (según carta cursada al Presidente Francisco García Calderón donde además, en lo que sería una bajeza y gran afrenta, señala que su padre era el coronel José Palma y no el Pedro que todos afirman), y la segunda en los cambios de nombre del niño (Manuel por Ricardo) y de la madre (Gillerma Carrillo por Dominga Soriano) que Porras Barrenechea le atribuye libremente sin considerar que tan importante información registral no puede variarse sino mediante anotación marginal, además de la descripción física hecha en la partida del niño Palma como de raza “pardo” (hijo de indio y negra), hecha por un canónigo registrador experto en esa apreciación, descripción que contradice con las fotografías que existen de Palma, de joven y viejo, a quien. de ninguna manera puede atribuírsele el calificativo de “pardo”.
Ahora bien, la tesis de que Palma haya nacido en Talavera está basada en la existencia centenaria en esa localidad de una familia Palma, uno de cuyos miembros era doña Justa Palma Mena quien, según numerosos testimonios recogidos por Monseñor Herrera, afirmaba que era hermana de Ricardo (de quien decía lo habían separado de niños para que éste se formase como cura) y con quien, además de tener un gran parecido físico, según numerosos testigos que la conocieron, mantenía correspondencia, tal cual lo atestiguaron los empleados postales de Talavera. Además, la hija de Justa Palma, Cecilia Samanez Palma, en sus viajes a Lima, solía hospedarse en casa de su tío Leoncio Samanez, frecuentemente visitada por Ricardo Palma, amigo íntimo sino pariente, y de quien afirmaba rotundamente su origen talaverino.
Monseñor Herrera, además, obtuvo testimonios, sino confesiones, de personas muy honorables que afirmaron, por escrito. el origen talaverino de Ricardo Palma de entre quienes destacan Juan Guillermo Samanez, reconocido pintor, Mateo Carrasco Cerón, nieto de Justa Palma, Emiliano Almanza, ilustre vecino de Talavera, del ex Presidente de la República David Samanez Ocampo, de Carmen Martinelli de Samanez, quien dice haber presenciado el encare de su tío Leoncio Samanez a Ricardo Palma exigiéndole que no negase su origen “talacho” (talaverino), lo cual le disgustó, y, finalmente, el testimonio de Virgilio Roberti Samanez quien afirma haber tenido en su biblioteca una edición de las “Tradiciones Peruanas” con una dedicatoria autógrafa del autor a la destacada dama apurimeña Carolina Segovia Samanez a quien Palma llama “codepartamentana”.
El estudio de Monseñor Herrera, por la calidad intelectual y moral del autor, fue muy bien recibido por intelectuales de la talla de Víctor Andrés Belaúnde y Luis E. Valcárcel quienes prologaron el libro y destacaron la validez de la tradición oral ante la prueba documental que, como se ha visto en muchos casos, puede ser torcida por las taras sociales de una época determinada.
La reciente valorización de la tradición oral frente a la prueba documental como fuente histórica ha vuelto a hacer vigente la tesis de Monseñor Herrera, como recientemente lo subrayó Marco Aurelio Denegri.


== Aeropuerto de Abancay ==

La ciudad de Abancay se encuentra ubicada en una zona geográfica difícil pues está en medio de dos cordilleras andinas, rodeada de cerros y montañas, con muchas subidas, curvas y bajadas que dificultan y alargan el transporte terrestre, por lo que desde décadas atrás se ha planteado la interrogante de que si era posible construir un aeropuerto en Abancay, un anhelo de la población en general.
Esta cuestión estuvo presente en Mons. Herrera quien, por sus calidades académicas y el dominio de idiomas, durante mucho tiempo, estuvo investigando las posibilidades de la construcción del aeropuerto, llegando a la conclusión de que ello sería posible en el sector denominado Leccleccpampa, ubicado al norte de Abancay, cerca a Saywite.
La reciente puesta en valor de las ruinas incas de Choquequirao (tan importantes como las de Machu Picchu) y la necesidad de construir un puente aéreo para el transporte de turistas extranjeros a la zona, ha rescatado la propuesta de Mons. Herrera siendo que el gobierno regional de Apurímac ha empezado a hacer los primeros movimientos de tierra y los estudios definitivos se encuentran en trámite. El proyecto busca crear una segunda ruta de acceso a la ciudadela de Machu Picchu, una ruta ""ecológica vivencial"", distinta al circuito comercial tradicional del Valle Sagrado, que atravesará las reservas naturales de Ampay y Choquequirao; además de promocionar los circuitos turísticos de Saywite y el Cañón del Río Apurímac.


== Himno a Apurímac ==
A Mons. Herrera se le reconoce ser el autor de la letra y música del Himno de Apurímac.[14]​[15]​

Entonemos un himno de gloria
A la tierra que nos vio nacer,
Cuyos valles y cielos pregonan
""para Apurímac gloria y honor"". (bis)

Gloria a los artistas que en Saywite
Esculpieron eterno primor,
Y nos legaron la gran herencia
De su arte y de su valor. (bis)

Honor a Micaela Bastidas
Heroína de ejemplar virtud,
A los próceres de nuestro pueblo
Y a los mártires mil del Perú. (bis)

Impulsemos la flora y fauna
Y exploremos el suelo doquier,
Pues esta tierra privilegiada
Es nueva tierra de promisión. (bis)

Compartamos fraternos ideales
Y formemos un solo corazón,
Andahuaylas, Antabamba,
Aymaraes y Chincheros,
Cotabambas, Grau y Abancay. (bis)

Adelante a la luz de la ciencia
Por el camino seguro del bien,
Y Apurímac será un oasis
Y el Perú un feliz edén. (bis)}}

Al igual que muchos dibujantes japoneses, comenzó dibujando dōjinshi para el Comiket, bajo el seudónimo de Awa Mizuno (水野亜和, Mizuno Awa), y posteriormente se introdujo en el manga comercial. Love Hina es el manga con el que se dio a conocer al mundo, aunque anteriormente había dibujado AI Ga Tomaranai y Always My Santa.
La mayor parte de sus obras tienen escenas ecchi y, concretamente, Love Hina y Magister Negi Magi se pueden considerar ""harem manga"", pues el protagonista es un chico rodeado de chicas.
Akamatsu reconoce que su personaje preferido de Love Hina es Motoko Aoyama. Mide 1,75 m y podría pasar por modelo. A primera vista es fuerte, pero le divierte dibujarla porque también tiene una parte sensible y a veces rompe a llorar.
El protagonista de Love Hina, Keitarô comienza habiendo suspendido dos veces el examen de acceso a la Universidad de Tokio como le sucedió a Ken en su propia vida.

534,"San Emerio o San Mer (Narbona, s. VIII – San Esteban de Guialbes, 800-827), abad de Bañolas, es uno de los más célebres miembros de la orden benedictina.
Abandonó la carrera militar y se retiró al desierto con un compañero llamado Patricio. Pero con motivo de la invasión mahometana y a petición del rey Carlos, entró con él en Cataluña, donde, según cuenta la leyenda, al llegar a la villa de Bañolas (Gerona), condolido de los daños considerables e innumerables estragos que en la comarca causaba un dragón de espantosa fiereza, se fue al lugar que habitaba la fiera y quedó ésta a la vista del santo como un manso cordero, y llevándola a la villa, hizo que le diesen muerte.
Pareciéndole el lugar que habitaba la fiera muy a propósito para la fundación de un monasterio, con ayuda y asistencia de Carlos lo edificó, quedándose en él como abad. Con el don de milagros, la gracia especial de curaciones y la fama de santidad, acudía gente de toda España. Pero por humildad y para mayor perfección se retiró a diez leguas de allí y erigió una capilla cerca del río llamado Fragat, en el territorio de San Esteban de Guialbes, en donde murió y en cuya iglesia parroquial se conservan sus reliquias.
Su fiesta se celebra el 27 de enero.

Ben Roethlisberger es calificado por ser el 10º Mariscal con la peor actuación en un Super Bowl y siendo el único de un equipo ganador debido a que solo completó 9 de 21 pases para 123 yardas sumado al horrible pase interceptado por Kelly Herndon para un regreso de 76 yardas que no pudo ser anotación gracias a una tacleada salvadora de Antwain Randle-El. Sin embargo, logró una anotación terrestre y convirtió una importante jugada de tercera y 29 yardas por avanzar en el segundo cuarto para remontar el marcador. A pesar de su actuación en el partido final hizo el mejor año de su carrera convirtiéndose en el mariscal más joven en ganar el Super Bowl con 23 años. Además, encabezó el bloqueo para lograr la jugada definitiva con una reversible con pase de Randle-El para Hines Ward y TD de 42 yardas en el cuarto periodo.
Un factor para la victoria fue el corredor Willie Parker, quien logró la acarreada más larga para anotación en la historia del Super Bowl, con una carrera de 75 yardas desde la línea de golpeo. El MVP del partido fue el receptor Hines Ward con 123 yardas y un TD. Además los Seahawks se convirtieron en el segundo equipo en perder el juego de campeonato aún habiendo superado en yardas y perdidas de balón al rival vencedor, sólo después de los Cinncinati Bengals quer fueron derrotados por San Francisco en el Super Bowl XVI.

539,"El movimiento punk es la contracultura que rodea a la música punk y los aficionados a ella. Usualmente vinculada a outsiders por la cultura popular, las prácticas contraculturales punks incluyen una serie de códigos de comportamiento, lenguaje, vestimenta y temáticas que se han vuelto recurrentes y que los distinguen. Su principal medio de expresión son los conciertos del género (""escena"") y las publicaciones de aficionados (""fanzine"").


== Historia ==

A mediados de la década de 1970 en Estados Unidos, Gran Bretaña y Australia, bajo la influencia de bandas de garage rock y rock agresivo, transgresor y a veces violento como por ejemplo MC5, The Stooges o New York Dolls, surge una corriente de bandas que basaban su música en fórmulas sencillas y un sonido especialmente fuerte. El punk fue primeramente un fenómeno estético-musical, que generó una moda generacional en los 1970, y más tarde fue tomando la forma de un movimiento estético-filosófico que se convertiría en una cultura. Sus inicios se sitúan en una sociedad anglosajona entonces saturada de clichés y convenciones estereotipadas, algunas de las primeras y principales bandas de este nuevo movimiento musical, filosofíco y estético son Ramones, The Damned, Sex Pistols, Dead Boys, Blondie y The Clash.
Coincidiendo con el final o el principio de crisis económicas en Estados Unidos y Gran Bretaña, el punk rock fue enlazando corrientes críticas a su alrededor que hicieron de él el movimiento de imagen agresiva y transgresora que hoy conocemos. Especialmente llamativa es la frecuente afinidad de los punks por los discursos anarquistas, haciendo del símbolo anarquista de la ""A"" un emblema típico del punk. Aunque la canción de los Sex Pistols ""Anarchy in the U.K."" parece el símbolo de esta relación, en realidad la canción es una chanza lanzada a la sociedad inglesa de la época, y la relación más seria del anarquismo y de otras ideologías políticas con el punk va mucho más allá.
Ya a finales de los 70, algunos grupos de punk comenzaron a hacer una música especialmente más fuerte y más rápida, lo que más tarde se llamó hardcore punk: Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, The Exploited, G.B.H, etc. A principios de los 80 el hardcore punk empezó a considerarse un subestilo por derecho propio. Al mismo tiempo, su carácter crítico y político se fue acentuando más y más, haciéndose ésta una carácterística generalmente considerada inseparable del mismo. Con el sonido de esta música como fondo, el eco del punk rock -tanto el seminal como el tardío- vio su presencia prolongada en la cultura occidental a lo largo de la década de los 80 en redes de intercambio cultural underground o marginales que funcionaban independientemente de la industria de la música y el espectáculo, hasta principios de los 90 en que hubo un nuevo estallido comercial de la música punk. A esas redes marginales pero estrechamente vinculadas y comunicadas entre sí se le llama a veces escena hardcore, o también simplemente movimiento punk. Durante los años 90 fue también vehículo de los mensajes del movimiento antiglobalización.


== La filosofía y la estética punk ==

La forma originaria del punk era un tipo de rock sencillo y algo ruidoso para expresarse con sus propios medios y conceptos. Entre las primeras bandas musicales representantes del punk están Ramones, The Dead Boys, The Voidoids, Blondie, The Heartbreakers, Tuff Darts, The Cramps, Misfits, Black Flag, The Gun Club, The Bags, Cherry Vanilla y Wayne County & the Electric Chairs y en el proto-punk los New York Dolls, The Velvet Underground (la banda de Lou Reed), Iggy Pop y The Stooges, Television, la cantante Patti Smith y The Dictators entre otros, todo esto en Estados Unidos. En el Reino Unido proliferarían agrupaciones como los Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Damned, Buzzcocks, The Adicts, The Pretenders, The Jam, The Stranglers y Adam & the Ants, además de David Bowie y T. Rex, quienes también influenciaron al punk igual que paralelamente lo hicieron las bandas proto-punk de garage de U.S.A
Los Ramones se presentaban a sí mismos como banda de rock and roll, sin pretensiones declaradas de mensaje directamente innovador o rompedor salvo en lo musical. Después surgiría la etiqueta punk y The Ramones serían considerados los primeros en representarla. Por otro lado había una forma de transgresión, buscando liberarse de los estigmas sociales. Esta rama no daba explicaciones y buscaba incomodar a lo establecido chocando, ofendiendo y molestando al buen gusto, la moral y la tradición. Se buscaba básicamente la provocación a través de demostraciones de transgresión estética o giros de lenguaje contradictorios, absurdos o insolentes. Es el estilo que popularizaron los Sex Pistols, relacionado ligeramente al nihilismo y otras formas de escepticismo. Más adelante, especialmente con la aparición del hardcore punk y marcado por la herencia de la actitud del colectivo Crass, se hizo presente todo un abanico de enfoques de crítica social, posicionamientos políticos, y afinidad a campañas de protesta. El ejemplo musical más clásico son Crass y The Clash.
La filosofía punk puede resumirse en:
""Hazlo tú mismo"" o ""hazlo a tu manera"".
Rechaza los dogmas y cuestiona lo establecido.
Desprecia las modas y la sociedad de masas.
En sus canciones, estas bandas expresan un serio descontento con los sistemas e instituciones que organizan y controlan el mundo. En ocasiones también la música sirve de plataforma para propuestas filosóficas e ideológicas. Durante la década de los 80, el punk en Estados Unidos estuvo permeado de contenidos políticos, principalmente progresistas, en oposición al gobierno conservador de la época. Ejemplos de esta época son las bandas Dead Kennedys y Bad Religion. En Europa, el punk es una música especialmente utilizada como medio de difusión por gente afín a movimientos políticos y sociales ""outsiders"", mayoritariamente de izquierda, aunque existe una corriente de derecha que lo utiliza, siendo criticada y denostada por la mayoría de los movimientos punk. A principios de los 90, las publicaciones amateur del punk y las canciones de los grupos también sirvieron como vehículo de los planteamientos y denuncias de los movimientos antiglobalización.


=== Contenido político ===
El movimiento punk no es un movimiento posicionado de una forma determinante y excluyente, pero si tiende a acoger diversas posiciones políticas muy marcadas. Sí ha tenido un componente de crítica sobre el malestar de la juventud sobre el rumbo de la sociedad contemporánea. Por lo pronto el punk siempre se ha mostrado como una corriente que discrepa de los estereotipos de estilos de vida y expectativas juveniles del ""establishment"", la educación convencional, las reglas de la estética, y los medios de comunicación de masas.
Cuando la música punk y la cultura punk contiene algún mensaje político, deja atrás el nihilismo y decadentismo de algunos grupos seminales. Aparecen mensajes con carga social. Esta línea de mensaje se esbozaba a veces en el punk original, aunque, más que una intención política premeditada, era más bien un fenómeno reactivo de creación de la juventud, ante una sociedad que consideraba estrecha.


=== Apariencia ===
Las chaquetas de cuero, zapatos altos y pantalones entubados oscuros están muy asociados con la estética punk, como también peinados cortos o desordenados y muchas veces teñidos. Los peinados mohicanos, en particular la variante fanhawk, y las Liberty spikes son quizá los peinados más asociados popularmente al movimiento. También suelen llevar tatuajes y perforaciones en la piel. El objetivo de la estética punk es dar un aspecto diferente y revolucionario para la sociedad.


== Principales corrientes estéticas y filosóficas ==


=== Situacionismo y transgresión ===
La manera en que los Sex Pistols popularizaron su particular forma de punk rock tiene que ver con la afición de su mánager, Malcolm McLaren, hacia la filosofía cultural del situacionismo. Cuando comenzó a representarles, McLaren ideaba una forma de estética basada en el rock de Nueva York (Los Ramones, Richard Hell) y el sonido Garage, junto a diversas y -aún hoy- confusas actitudes de provocación que recogía en diferentes ambientes creativos. McLaren fue un artista y diseñador influido por el situacionismo y desde antes de los primeros momentos de los Sex Pistols buscaba crear una estética nueva y rompedora que hiciese saltar por los aires los conceptos del momento referentes a estética, comportamiento y música, y al mismo tiempo demostrar que puede convertirse en negocio. Su idea era conseguir cambiar el significado de lo que es normal, lo que es bonito, lo que es correcto, mediante la reiteración de la costumbre y la publicidad.
El punk favoreció un ambiente de intervención estética transgresora. Muchos de los motivos estéticos del punk que siguen vigentes como arquetipos del mismo aparecieron en aquella primera época, como cortes de pelo (pelos de punta, teñidos de colores verdes, azules...crestas, candados...), ropa rota o mal cosida, imperdibles u otros accesorios dispuestos por la ropa... También se utilizaron mensajes y símbolos en un principio sin representar corrientes masivas: ejemplo de esto son los símbolos anarquistas por un lado, y los símbolos nazis por otro. En ambos casos se trataba a menudo más de una provocación que de un alarde de posición.


=== La ""Escena Hardcore"" ===
Una parte particularmente activa de la cultura punk ha girado en torno a las vertientes musicales de punk más enérgico, conocidas como hardcore que aparecen a partir de 1978. A partir de los años 80 el hardcore se convirtió en un estilo de música muy imitado en muchos países, por su facilidad de ser tocado y por la energía que transmite para una juventud buscando motivación y emociones. Al surgir este estilo hicieron presencia un gran número de bandas con mensajes más radicales que las corrientes anteriores, tanto en posicionamiento de análisis social e ideológico, como en otros temas surgidos también de la insatisfacción social, pero que se encaminarían hacia una temática positiva y motivacionista, a veces incluso contraria al uso de drogas.

Frecuentemente no es una escena tan centrada en la estética como el punk anterior, sino más enfocada a ponerle música a formas de comunicación entre los jóvenes tal cual son, pero sin paños calientes sobre la frustración social que les lleva a interesarse por una forma de expresión como es el punk.
Las ciudades más destacadas donde se originó y desarrollo el hardcore fueron Nueva York, Los Ángeles, y Washintong D.C., entre otras. Aunque tienen muchos rasgos comunes, sobre todo en las primeras épocas de los 70 y 80, cada una desarrolló su particular estilo y filosofía. La escena hardcore se difundió especialmente a través de la subcultura del skate (ver skate punk).


=== Punk y movimiento hippie ===
Inicialmente, las bandas y jóvenes que luego se llamaron punks eran seguidores del rock transgresor de la época, que aún compartía rasgos con el movimiento hippie. Posteriormente los punks criticaron a los hippies acusándolos de blandos, atribuyéndoles un origen burgués y un exceso de mística, si bien ambos movimientos comparten ideales, como la tolerancia, la diversidad creativa, la libertad de expresión y la crítica al sistema establecido y los valores convencionales. Además los hippies fueron de los primeros movimientos dentro del rock en experimentar con formas de convivencia alternativas, como comunas, como también haría más tarde el punk. Los hippies seguían una estética y un discurso básicamente positivo, pero, visto que las décadas anteriores de estos movimientos culturales no habían removido definitivamente los sistemas políticos y de valores de la sociedad, el punk optó por ridiculizarla y confrontarla de forma directamente chocante.
En los movimientos culturales alternativos ha existido alguna fusión natural de ambos movimientos, de modo que pueden existir personas que formen parte cruzada de los mismos sin atenerse a las etiquetas estereotipadas que los definen. Esto también ocurría en los 60 y 70 con la influencia del hippismo en el rock.


=== ""Straight edge"" y ""Destroy"" ===

La tendencia transgresora de algunas bandas de rock y punk dio cabida a actitudes que pretendían romper los roles sociales y estéticos, dando con ello espacio a veces a comportamientos más o menos autodestructivos o negligentes. Esto se bautizó como actitud o estética Destroy. Este fenómeno es uno de los arquetipos del joven punk; sin embargo, existían posturas dentro de los ambientes punk que no sólo eran críticas con la sociedad establecida, sino también con el comportamiento de los jóvenes rebeldes: Como contrapunto, el llamado straight edge, asociado originariamente al círculo de hardcore punks de Washington, D.C, se posicionaba contra el estereotipo del roquero cercano a las drogas y la desmotivación. De algún modo, esta respuesta, sin pretensiones de movimiento en un principio, significó una diferencia con la filosofía punk del ""no future"" (punks que pensaban que todo estaba perdido y no había más motivo para intentar mejorar la situación o para ser personas activas, por ello se entregaban totalmente al alcohol, drogas o cualquier otra cosa que los alejara de la realidad, haciéndolos espectadores pasivos de la vida).
Aunque no era la única línea existente al respecto dentro del punk, la corriente straight edge respondía a un posicionamiento vital alternativo que intenta concretar y pulir el significado del punk como reacción a estándares socioculturales.
Normalmente la temática del straight edge gira en torno a:
enfoques positivos sobre las cualidades de la juventud, la amistad, la satisfacción de esforzarse por un objetivo, o la participación en un proyecto común -especialmente lo que a veces se llama escena hardcore, o la subcultura punk-.
sugerir el abandono de las drogas, el tabaco y el alcohol.
formas de ecologismo social como el vegetarianismo.
Algunos sXe optaron por planteamientos mucho más estrictos evitando también la cafeína, el sexo promiscuo, o posicionándose a favor del vegetarianismo o el veganismo.
El straight edge supuso, en cierto modo, una de las consolidaciones de estéticas y planteamientos dentro del punk directamente enfocados hacia una vida sana, intentando proponer un enfoque positivo de la frustración juvenil.


=== Anarcopunk ===

Aunque la famosa canción de los Sex Pistols ""Anarchy in the U.K."" no era una propuesta seria, sino una visión irónica de los miedos del pensamiento establecido inglés, el anarquismo fue desde muy pronto un recurrido punto de interés para los aficionados al punk (anarcopunk), hasta el punto de que en ocasiones, tanto dentro como fuera de ambos movimientos, se llega a confundir uno con el otro. El símbolo anarquista de la A dentro de un círculo ha sido adoptado por el punk casi como un símbolo propio, que puede ser utilizado para representar tanto afinidades políticas como simplemente las actitudes de rebeldía.
Uno de los primeros grupos de punk en afirmar su adscripción al pensamiento anarquista fueron Crass, que con sus acciones y pequeños movimientos organizados marcaron una pauta repetida por una gran mayoría de los colectivos punk de izquierdas de todo el mundo. Otro grupo con una orientación política similar fue Dead Kennedys.
A mediados de los 80, de una evolución del sonido hardcore más sucio y agresivo que practicaban Discharge, surge el subestilo d-beat, y particularmente el crust punk y grindcore. Sobre su base musical super violenta, se gritan letras que hacen hincapié en los aspectos terribles de la corrupción política y económica, las guerras, el hambre, los desastres ecológicos y la manipulación de los medios de comunicación. Este estilo del punk frecuentemente se presenta como afín a discursos anarquistas, ecologistas, feministas y antiglobalización.


=== Queerpunk ===

Queerpunk es un movimiento cultural y social aparecido dentro del punk a mediados de los años 1980 a partir del Queercore. Unifica a una especie peculiar de punk que rechaza las reglas heteronormativas y la cultura gay “establecida”. Aunque en sus orígenes el punk era también espacio de expresión de la homosexualidad y la ambigüedad, más tarde la homofobia se hizo más frecuente. El Queerpunk crea y reclama su propio espacio de activismo y creación dentro del punk. El homocore tiene expresiones esencialmente musicales, aunque también incluye expresiones en fanzines, cine y otras formas de arte. La banda musical más famosa es Pansy Division, y Bruce LaBruce viene a ser su embajador en el mundo del cine.


=== Riot Grrrl ===

Riot Grrrl (o Riot Grrl) es un movimiento musical feminista que alcanzó el pico de su fama en la década de 1990 pero continuó con una significativa influencia sobre la cultura musical alternativa del grunge.
El término Riot Grrrl es también una designación de género, referida al movimiento inicial cercano a la música punk y a todo su arco de influencia, las autodenominadas Riot Grrrls, quienes proclaman y fomentan una manera de actuar feminista tomada del movimiento punk -el ""hazlo tu mismo/a""- una forma de organizar a todas las bandas musicales integradas sólo por mujeres, festivales musicales exclusivos o especializados para mujeres, grupos de reunión y publicaciones independientes feministas.


=== Ecologismo y animalismo ===
El ecologismo ha sido uno de los intereses de un sector del movimiento punk. Muchas bandas han venido citando en sus canciones los problemas de la contaminación, la explotación desmedida de los recursos por la sociedad industrial y el mercado de consumo, el cambio climático y el calentamiento global, etc. Este tema ha llegado incluso a formar un pilar fundamental de algunas de sus corrientes, ya desde los tiempos de la banda pionera Crass. El crustcore y el straight edge son vertientes del punk en que abundan las letras sobre ecologismo político.
Muchos de los colectivos o ambientes punk se declaran colectivos pro-ecologismo y pro-derechos de los animales. Suele haber grupos dedicados a la organización de charlas y la edición y distribución de literatura ecologista y política, ecologismo en los hábitos de consumo, agricultura, vegetarianismo y alimentación vegetariana, veganismo, etc.
El discurso animalista también hizo que el punk se aproximase a filosofías de carácter espiritual como el hinduismo, el budismo, o la secta Hare Krishna.


=== Anti-religión ===
El punk se presenta como una cultura mayoritariamente atea (también antiteísta o irreligiosa). Un sector del movimiento punk hace énfasis en este aspecto criticando constantemente a las costumbres de religiosidad social del cristianismo al uso, por considerarlas hipócritas, y a las instituciones y discursos religiosos en general, por considerarlos un disfraz del control social y el mantenimiento de posiciones de poder. El ateísmo más racionalista dentro del punk opta por un discurso que parte de la negación de la idea de ""Dios"" y de toda clase de misticismo.
Pero también hay declaraciones directas de afinidad con ideas religiosas vinculadas a algunas bandas musicales o seguidores del punk. Una de las primeras inclusiones de afinidades religiosas en el punk puede considerarse Bad Brains, uno de los grupos pioneros de hardcore, afines al rastafarismo. También son conocidas afinidades con religiones orientales como el hinduismo y el budismo.
También hay una numerosa posición agnóstica o desligada de la discusión religiosa.


=== Cyberpunk ===
El cyberpunk surgió como género cinematográfico de ciencia ficción distópico. Se basa en los supuestos de una sociedad futura hipertecnológica, y recrea situaciones donde las máquinas y el poder político y económico han desnaturalizado la sociedad humana. De este género surge una filosofía y estética que adapta la crítica social y el activismo a un mundo cada vez más tecnologizado, donde esta tecnología puede servir a intereses mediáticos, económicos, militares o geopolíticos, atropellando soslayadamente derechos humanos y sociales a través de los vacíos legales sobre los que innova.
Esta temática enlaza con las nuevas corrientes filosóficas y sociológicas que analizan el significado de la verdad como un consenso, y los engaños convencionales que pueden surgir de ello. Un ejemplo de esta propuesta filosófica son las películas Ghost in the shell, Matrix y Blade Runner (siendo esta última la precursora y principal fuente de inspiración del género -inspirada en la novela de Philip K. Dick, ""¿Sueñan los androides con ovejas eléctricas?"" o su título original ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?""). Estas corrientes guardan algunos paralelismos con la filosofía oriental y su idea de la realidad (véase: orientalismo).


== Métodos de intercambio ==


=== Comunicación independiente o ""underground"" ===
Durante los 80 y 90 el punk y el hardcore, al igual que otras músicas independientes, formaban una especie de red internacional no planeada a través del correo. Los aficionados a estos estilos de música y a los planteamientos políticos anexos, intercambiaban discos, fotos, panfletos, zines y fanzines. En la publicación de los fanzines se popularizó la entrevista por correo, que permitió a los interesados conocer grupos musicales y ambientes locales de países lejanos cuando aún no era un género presente en las discográficas comerciales, los medios de comunicación de masas o las modas, y antes de la aparición de internet. Incluso a veces se aprovechaban las carpetas de los discos de vinilo como medio de transporte de variados panfletos o flyers, que los intermediarios iban metiendo, hasta el comprador final.
La publicación de zines, discos y cintas de casete, con recopilaciones de grabaciones de músicos de hardcore y punk -muy a menudo de baja calidad de sonido- , conformó una vital subcultura underground, con formas estéticas, de producción, difusión y comunicación propias. Esta comunicación permitió también la amistad y colaboración entre ambientes punk y políticos de lugares alejados geográficamente, y enriqueciendo las oportunidades de tocar en directo de las formaciones musicales.
Algunas voces reclaman para Internet el carácter de comunicación activa ""a escala humana"" que este tráfico de información tiene dentro del punk y las subculturas underground.
El carácter de estos circuitos de comunicación e intercambio, y del propio movimento punk, a menudo van acompañados de planteamientos de libre copia y difusión o anticopyright de las grabaciones y los textos.(Ver copyright y copyleft)
También se ha hecho y se hace uso de las ondas radiofónicas en la forma de radios libres (es decir, sin autorización expresa oficial para emitir, contrastando con las grandes cadenas radiofónicas asentadas sobre estructuras comerciales), organizadas por colectivos vecinales, culturales o reivindicativos.


=== Medios amateur o ""alternativos"" de edición. ===

El movimiento punk definió sus propios lemas y parámetros de comportamiento en políticas de edición musical que respondían a su carácter de subcultura underground carente de medios organizados, intenciones y planteamientos sociales o políticos, o la idea de la cultura escala humana y vecinal:


==== ""Hazlo tú mismo"" ====

""Hazlo tú mismo"" (Do it yourself) se refiere a la organización y/o elaboración de resultados sin acudir a las vías generalmente aceptadas como habituales, como pueden ser medios de comunicación de masas, grandes empresas discográficas, editoriales literarias, o instituciones culturales oficiales(ej. Las Sucias Rtas de P.R.). Esto generó la aparición de pequeños sellos discográficos, asociaciones, pequeñas editoriales o individuos que llevaban a cabo publicaciones más o menos caseras, e innumerables referencias discográficas. Con esta motivación los circuitos punk se llenaron de productos editados con medios baratos o incluso domésticos, y distribuidos de mano en mano:

discos de vinilo, especialmente de 7"",
edición y venta aceptada de casetes de audio, a menudo duplicados y/o grabados con aparatos domésticos,
portadas, libros y periodismo amateur reproducidos por fotocopiadoras,
videocassettes de edición casera

Dado el carácter inmediato no profesional y ""casero"" de muchas de estas producciones, la deficiencia de la calidad de sonido o impresión se volvió una marca estética y una garantía de autenticidad underground, acompañada de un discurso crítico hacia el mercado lucrativo musical o artístico, las grandes compañías discográficas o los grupos de rock y pop famosos.


==== ""Sin beneficio"" ====
""Sin beneficio""(Non Profit) es el lema de la política de edición y distribución con que se declara que los productos han sido puestos en circulación sin fines lucrativos. El autor y el vendedor defienden que su distribución y venta está motivada por la comunicación y la expresión, y el precio de venta final suele superar los costes de producción sólo lo suficiente para pagar la distribución, o donar unos pequeños beneficios a alguna asociación o causa sociopolítica. El dúo británico Active Minds editó algunos flexi-ep, discos de vinilo de 7"" muy finos de una sola cara que permiten una reducción considerable del precio. Durante los años 90, se popularizó la aparición de etiquetas que decían ""no pagues más de (X) pesetas"" y ""si te piden más, róbalo"".
Ediciones benéficas: las inquietudes políticas de este movimiento juvenil se sirven de la edición musical para recolectar fondos para causal sociales, políticas o ecológicas, o financiar campañas o asociaciones. En los circuitos underground los autores partidarios de la libre difusión o anticopyright celebran que se dupliquen y distribuyan sus obras para algunas causas.


==== Anticopyright y Anti-CD ====
Anticopyright: Estos tipos de comportamiento editorial también estaban relacionados con políticas de libre difusión, a veces llamados ""no copyright"" o ""anticopyright"". Muchos autores consentían, autorizaban -mediante avisos en las carátulas-, incluso alentaban y celebraban, la libre copia y venta de sus creaciones. Una gran cantidad de aficionados al hardcore punk han defendido y defienden que su participación musical o cultural no tiene vistas a la fama o el lucro. Se critica a su vez a los grupos de rock y pop, a quienes se acusa de servirse de la música popular y de la rebeldía del rock y de las leyes de propiedad intelectual, para lucrarse y convertirse a en parte del las modas y el ""stablishment"".
Bootleg: Los bootlegs son ediciones no autorizadas de baja calidad. Eran grabaciones de conciertos hechas con grabadoras de mano, o recopilaciones de discos de artistas, hechas por seguidores, puestas a la venta como rarezas o ediciones paralelas. Aunque a algunos grupos les parecía incorrecta esta práctica, otros han dicho estar de acuerdo o restarle importancia.
The (International) Noise Conspiracy retrasaron cerca de un año la aparición de su larga duración del 2004, debido a discrepancias respecto a las leyes editoriales estadounidenses, que obligan a insertar en el diseño de las carátulas una etiqueta de aviso del FBI sobre violación de derechos de autor. El grupo no está a favor de que se prohíban el uso y copia libres de sus trabajos, por lo que se negaron a incluir una advertencia con la que no se comprometían.

Anti-CD: Anteriormente a la expansión de los equipos de copia y reproducción domésticos de discos compactos, algunas voces dentro del hardcore punk defendían que los colectivos culturales vecinales, y los grupos de música popular joven, debían boicotear la puesta en el mercado de dichos sistemas.
Sus argumentos eran
lo consideraban una manipulación consumista de las necesidades de la sociedad. Se oponían a la creación de formas de poder de transformación social para las grandes empresas industriales que, a través de la alteración planificada de los estándares de consumo, mantendrían el control sobre los espacios de mercado definidos por las propias industrias.
defendían el mantenimiento de estándares de edición que por aquél entonces eran los que estaban al alcance del consumidor medio, y ampliamente extendidos
desconfiaban que la reproducción en cd fuese una garantía de abaratamiento de los precios de la música, por lo tanto lo consideraban otra herramienta manipulable por las grandes discográficas.

Estos argumentos venían definidos por el hecho de que las patentes de los sistemas de reproducción de audio estaban en ese momento en manos de grupos como Phillips y Sony, poseedoras además de intereses directos en el mercado musical, acusados por el movimiento punk de valerse de la cultura popular juvenil para lucrarse, y deformar los mensajes contestatarios e inconformistas del rock a través de la creación de modas y estéticas banales.
Esta propuesta de boicot tuvo relativa aceptación, de modo que muchos grupos fueron reacios a comenzar a editar su música en cd, y los colectivos punk a distribuirlos.


==== Distribuidoras ====
En algunos países, reciben el nombre de distribuidora o distro los grupos o individuos bajo un seudónimo, que dedican tiempo y medios a la venta de material editorial y merchandising relacionado con el movimiento punk. Suelen estar definidas por las políticas editoriales mencionadas, aunque en algunos casos se ha convertido en un pluriempleo de subsistencia. Funcionan a través de la venta por correo o la venta directa en eventos y conciertos, y a menudo se ha practicado el trueque de material entre colectivos y distribuidoras.


=== Colectivos culturales punks ===
Alrededor de la música punk o sus planteamientos han surgido algunos grupos activistas, organizados. Asociaciones motivadas por los planteamientos punk pueden aparecer mezclados con otros grupos juveniles, colectivos de okupas - a través de los denominados espacios alternativos-, sindicatos u otras asociaciones reivindicativas, campañas o grupos ecologistas, Comunas, cooperativas, grupos de artistas y colectivos musicales, movimientos subculturales.
Estas organizaciones pueden poner en marcha: actividades culturales (conciertos, exposiciones, teatro, cine o vídeo...), cursillos y talleres, charlas y jornadas temáticas -generalmente con contenido social y político-, espacios artísticos, espacios para movimientos sociales, movimientos políticos, ONG, campañas de reivindicación, organización de contrainformación, iniciativas editoriales (literarias, musicales, vídeos, merchandising, etc.), restaurantes alternativos, (ecológicos y a precios reducidos).

541,"El Castillo de Glenarm es un castillo situado en Glenarm, en el condado de Antrim, en Irlanda del Norte, el Reino Unido. Es el hogar ancestral de los condes de Antrim.
Hubo un castillo en Glenarm desde el siglo XIII y este es el corazón de una de las propiedades más antiguas de Irlanda del Norte.
John Bisset, expulsado de Escocia en 1242 por haber matado un rival durante un torneo, prometió ir a Tierra Santa como peregrinaje, pero en lugar de esto adquirió tierras en Irlanda, entre Larne y Ballycastle, a Hugo de Lacy, conde de Ulster. Bisset hizo de Glenarm su capital y sobre el año 1260 había construido un castillo en el centro de donde se encuentra la población actual. El antiguo juzgado de la población tiene algunos de sus muros y en los años 1970 se encontró el esqueleto de una persona que había sido empadelado.
El último MacEoin Bisset murió en 1522 luchando contra los O'Donnells. Sus tierras pasaron a manos de los MacDonnells, los antiguos socios de los Bissets, quienes ocuparon el antiguo castillo de Glenarm.
El actual castillo fue construido por sir Randall MacDonnell, 1er conde de Antrim en 1636. Es propiedad de Alexander McDonnell, 9º conde de Antrim y está ocupado por su hijo Randal Alexander St John McDonnell, vizconde de Dunluce, y su esposa Aurora.
El castillo está abierto al público entre mayo y septiembre. Todos los años, en julio, se celebran en los jardines del castillo los Juegos de la montaña.

542,"Las elecciones presidenciales de Argentina de 2011 se llevaron a cabo el domingo 23 de octubre[2]​ de 2011 junto a las elecciones legislativas, de acuerdo a lo establecido en la Constitución de la Nación Argentina y las leyes electorales.
Los candidatos surgieron de elecciones primarias abiertas, simultáneas y obligatorias llevadas a cabo el 14 de agosto de 2011, realizadas por primera vez en la historia argentina.
El mismo día, fueron electos los nuevos diputados y senadores del Congreso de la Nación Argentina.
Resultó reelecta Presidenta de la Nación Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, con más del 54% de los votos y por una diferencia de más de 37 puntos (37.30) frente al candidato del Frente Amplio Progresista, Hermes Binner. De esta manera, Cristina se convirtió en la primera mujer reelecta en América, habiendo obtenido la mayor cantidad y porcentaje de votos en una elección desde el retorno de la democracia en 1983 y la segunda mayor ventaja histórica respecto al candidato ubicado en segundo lugar, superando por un punto porcentual a la victoria obtenida por Marcelo T. de Alvear en 1922, pero 0.13% por debajo de la victoria de Juan Domingo Perón en 1973.
Otra rareza de esta elección es que por primera vez en más de treinta años uno de los dos candidatos presidenciales más votados no era abogado, ya que Hermes Binner es graduado en medicina. En los seis comicios presidenciales que se realizaron a partir del retorno de la democracia en 1983, las dos fórmulas más votadas era encabezadas por abogados. El antecedente más cercano había sido en 1973, cuando Juan Domingo Perón (militar) superó a otro letrado, Ricardo Balbín.
Reasumió el 10 de diciembre del 2011, un nuevo período de cuatro años al frente del Poder Ejecutivo y ocupa la sexagésimo primera presidencia de la nación desde la sanción de la Constitución de 1853.[3]​


== Candidatos presidenciales ==


=== Partido Justicialista ===
El peronismo aparece dividido en tres facciones. Por un lado se encuentra el Partido Justicialista que forma parte del Frente para la Victoria, mientras que por el otro se halla el peronismo disidente dividido en dos espacios: Unión Popular y Peronismo Federal.


==== Frente para la Victoria ====
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: ex Diputada Provincial (1991-1995), ex Diputada Nacional (1997-2001), ex Senadora Nacional (1995-1997; 2001-2005; 2005-2007), ex Primera Dama (2003-2007) y Presidenta de la Nación Argentina (2007-2011).[4]​ El 21 de junio de 2011 confirmó públicamente su postulación para la reelección,[5]​ la misma fue una decisión que, según sus propias declaraciones, había tomado desde la sorpresiva muerte a fines de 2010 de Néstor Kirchner,[6]​ quien era su cónyuge desde 1975, ex Presidente de la Nación (2003-2007), Presidente del Partido Justicialista y firme candidato del Frente para la Victoria para los comicios presidenciales.[7]​
Recibió el apoyo manifiesto de diversos sectores, entre ellos: el secretario general de la Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) Hugo Moyano,[8]​ el secretario general de la Unión Obrera Metalúrgica (UOM) Antonio Caló,[9]​ el Secretario General de la Federación de Tierra y Vivienda (FTV) y Central de Movimientos Populares (CMP) Luis D'Elía,[10]​ así como también el de varios gobernadores, legisladores, funcionarios, las asociaciones de Madres y Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (presididas por Hebe de Bonafini y Estela de Carlotto, respectivamente)[11]​ y Hugo Chávez (Presidente de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela) quien afirmó, durante la entrega de una distinción en la Facultad de Periodismo de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata, que la mandataria ""es la mujer que Argentina necesita ahora para seguir con el rumbo de esta nave"".[12]​
Su compañero de fórmula fue Amado Boudou, Ministro de Economía y Finanzas Públicas en el período 2009-2011.[13]​ Se convirtió, además, en la ganadora de las primeras elecciones primarias en la historia argentina, habiendo obtenido poco más del 50% de los votos válidamente emitidos y una ventaja de 38% sobre Ricardo Alfonsín, candidato de la Unión Cívica Radical.[14]​


==== Unión Popular ====
Eduardo Duhalde: ex Intendente de Lomas de Zamora (1974-1976; 1983-1987), ex Diputado Nacional (1987-1989), ex Vicepresidente de la Nación (1989-1991), ex Gobernador de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (1991-1999) y ex Presidente interino de la Nación por aplicación de la Ley de Acefalía entre enero de 2002 y mayo de 2003.[15]​ Lanzó formalmente su precandidatura presidencial el 20 de diciembre de 2010 en un acto en Costa Salguero ante cinco mil personas, con un discurso que duró poco más de cuarenta minutos. Se presentó como el candidato capaz de ""pacificar y ordenar"" la Argentina, apelando en varias oportunidades al apego al orden y la ley. Duhalde puso como ejemplos a varios presidentes latinoamericanos, tal es el caso de Lula da Silva, Michelle Bachelet y José Mujica; además estableció cuatro puntos principales de su propuesta electoral: políticas de Estado, la restitución de la autoridad y de la paz, la plena vigencia de los derechos humanos ""del pasado, del presente y del futuro"" y la construcción de un progresismo moderno ""con respeto a las instituciones democráticas"".[16]​ Aseguró que con el jefe de gobierno porteño, Mauricio Macri, y otros sectores políticos, ha firmado acuerdos de políticas públicas y que existe la posibilidad de futuras conversaciones.[17]​
Participó en la preinterna partidaria por regiones del Peronismo Federal frente a Alberto Rodríguez Saá pero, ante graves entredichos con su contrincante, decidió abandonarla y posteriormente alejarse del partido formando un nuevo espacio denominado ""Unión Popular"".[18]​ Su compañero de fórmula fue Mario Das Neves, gobernador de la Provincia del Chubut.


==== Peronismo Federal ====
Alberto Rodríguez Saá: ex Senador Nacional (1983-1994; 2000-2001) y Gobernador de San Luis (2003-2007 y 2007-2011). Comenzó su campaña el 31 de marzo de 2011 con un acto en el Predio Ferial de La Rural en el cual hizo un repaso de su gestión en San Luis y proyectó sus logros en la provincia a la Nación como parte de su plan de gobierno.[19]​ Su compañero de fórmula es el exgobernador de la Provincia de Santa Fe, José María ""Tati"" Vernet.


=== Unión Cívica Radical ===
Diputado Ricardo Luis Alfonsín: ex Diputado Provincial (1999-2003), Diputado Nacional desde 2009 e hijo del expresidente Raúl Alfonsín, quien gobernó entre 1983 y 1989.[20]​[21]​Lanzó su precandidatura presidencial el 3 de diciembre de 2010 con un acto presenciado por treinta mil personas en la intersección de la calle San José y Avenida de Mayo (Capital Federal).[22]​
Su eslogan de campaña es ""transformar el crecimiento en desarrollo"". Manifestó que la prioridad en su plan de gobierno estará centrada en terminar con la pobreza extrema (piensa en un Plan Crianza que contenga a los menores de 5 años), modernizar la matriz energética, darle valor agregado a la industria, federalizar los recursos y acercar la ciencia y la tecnología a la producción, entre otros ejes.[23]​
Fue declarado candidato oficial del partido tras el abandono de la candidatura presidencial por parte de Ernesto Sanz y Julio Cobos.[24]​[25]​ En el mes de junio oficializó un acuerdo electoral con Francisco De Narváez, integrante de Unión Celeste y Blanco (rama conservadora del Partido Justicialista), a la vez que designó como compañero de fórmula a Javier González Fraga, economista y expresidente del Banco Central.


=== Partido Socialista ===
Hermes Binner: ex Intendente de la Ciudad de Rosario (1995-1999 y 1999-2003), ex Diputado Nacional (2005-2007 y Gobernador de la Provincia de Santa Fe desde 2007. En declaraciones al periodismo en marzo de 2011 comunicó su intención de ir como candidato a la presidencia y volvió a distanciarse de Rubén Giustiniani, senador y Presidente del Partido Socialista.[26]​ Hasta mayo de 2011, el Partido Socialista y el Partido Generación para un Encuentro Nacional (GEN) estaban construyendo una alianza con la Unión Cívica Radical con Binner y Alfonsín como figuras principales, pero el acuerdo entre este último y la fuerza política que dirige Francisco de Narváez en la provincia de Buenos Aires, significaron la ruptura de la incipiente alianza.[21]​[27]​ Su compañera de fórmula fue la senadora nacional por Córdoba, Norma Morandini.[28]​


=== Coalición Cívica ===
Elisa Carrió: Diputada Nacional desde 2009 y en otras tres oportunidades (1995-1999, 1999-2003 y 2005-2007). Fue candidata presidencial en el año 2003 y en el año 2007. Presentó su candidatura el 12 de diciembre de 2010 en el barrio porteño de Recoleta ante poco más de dos mil personas. En el acto de lanzamiento realizó fuertes críticas al kirchnerismo, al Jefe de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires (Mauricio Macri) y a la Unión Cívica Radical. También se leyeron adhesiones de la pata radical en la Coalición Cívica y del partido de Patricia Bullrich, Unión por Todos; contó además con la presencia de emisarios de Ricardo López Murphy.[29]​
Durante una conferencia en la Universidad de Belgrano, en diciembre de 2010, dio a conocer los dos principales ejes programáticos: una nueva Ley de Coparticipación ""que termine con la chequera que extorsiona a los gobernadores e Intendentes"" y una nueva Ley de Educación, al tiempo que afirmó que su gobierno será ""el único de los últimos años que va a asumir sin ningún compromiso con las corporaciones económicas o sindicales"".[30]​ Su compañero de fórmula fue el diputado nacional Adrián Pérez.


=== Frente de Izquierda y de los Trabajadores ===
Jorge Altamira: Ex legislador de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires (2000-2004) y dirigente histórico del Partido Obrero. Fue electo como candidato a Presidente por el Frente de Izquierda y de los Trabajadores (FIT), una alianza electoral conformada por el Partido Obrero, el Partido de los Trabajadores Socialistas (PTS) y por la Izquierda Socialista.[31]​ Su compañero de fórmula fue Christian Castillo, docente universitario y dirigente del Partido de los Trabajadores Socialistas (PTS).[32]​


=== Precandidatos que abandonaron su aspiración presidencial ===
Otros políticos que habían considerado una candidatura a la presidencia durante el año 2011 pero que luego la abandonaron fueron:
Mario Das Neves, por el Peronismo Federal: Gobernador de la Provincia del Chubut (2003-2007 y reelecto hasta 2011). Fue el primero de los presidenciables en lanzar su candidatura, la cual se llevó a cabo en un acto realizado en agosto de 2009 en la localidad de Piedra del Águila, Provincia de Neuquén.
El 2 de abril de 2011, días después de que su partido obtuviera resultados desfavorables en las elecciones a Gobernador en su propia provincia y luego de un gran escándalo mediático debido a denuncias por graves irregularidades durante los comicios, decidió abandonar su aspiración por alcanzar la Presidencia.[33]​ Posteriormente, en el mes de junio, aceptó la propuesta de Eduardo Duhalde para acompañarlo en la fórmula presidencial.[34]​
Ernesto Sanz, por la UCR: Actual Senador Nacional por la provincia de Mendoza y Presidente de la Unión Cívica Radical. Lanzó su precandidatura el 2 de marzo de 2011 en un acto realizado en el Teatro Gran Rex en el cual buscó diferenciarse de su rival intrapartidario (Ricardo Alfonsín) y realizó variadas críticas al kirchnerismo. A fines de marzo de 2011 decidió no presentarse en la preinterna partidaria pero confirmó su participación en las primarias abiertas y generales de agosto. Un mes después decidió abandonar su aspiración presidencial.[35]​
Julio Cobos, por la UCR: Ex Gobernador de la Provincia de Mendoza (2003-2007) y Vicepresidente de la Nación durante el período 2007-2011. Negó desde un principio su participación en la preinterna partidaria a la vez que pidió en reiteradas oportunidades la postergación de las mismas, lo cual fue rechazado tanto por Ricardo Alfonsín como por Ernesto Sanz. El 7 de abril de 2011 decidió bajarse de la carrera por la Presidencia de la Nación luego de que el partido declarara como candidato oficial a Ricardo Alfonsín debido a que fue el único candidato en no bajarse de la preinterna partidaria.
Fernando Solanas, por Proyecto Sur: Diputado Nacional y excandidato presidencial en las elecciones de 2007. Presentó formalmente su candidatura a Presidente de la Nación en diciembre de 2010 con un acto ante más de seis mil personas en el estadio de Ferro Carril Oeste. El 2 de mayo anunció formalmente su candidatura por la Jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en Parque Centenario y estimó que era muy probable que su compañera de fórmula fuese Graciela Ocaña,[36]​ lo que finalmente no ocurrió.
Mauricio Macri, por Propuesta Republicana: Jefe de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires durante el período 2007-2011. Demostró afinidad e intentos de coordinación con el PJ Federal[37]​ pero, a fines de marzo de 2011 y luego de la escandalosa elección a gobernador por la Provincia del Chubut en la que el PJ Federal se vio envuelto en denuncias por graves irregularidades, decidió ""enfriar"" los contactos con ese partido ya que consideró que un acercamiento le traería ""más problemas que beneficios"".[38]​ En los primeros días de mayo de 2011 decidió bajarse de la candidatura presidencial y apostar por su reelección al frente de la Jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires hasta el año 2015, lo cual finalmente ocurrió.
Felipe Solá, por el Movimiento por la Equidad, Justicia y Organización:[39]​ Exgobernador de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (2002-2007) y diputado nacional. Lanzó su precandidatura en la ciudad bonaerense de San Nicolás el 28 de junio de 2010, fecha en la que celebraba el primer aniversario de las elecciones legislativas en la que su alianza con Francisco De Narváez (Unión - Pro) le ganó en la Provincia de Buenos Aires a Néstor Kirchner (Frente para la Victoria). Finalmente desistió de su candidatura presidencial.[40]​


=== Candidaturas ===


== Elecciones primarias ==

Las elecciones primarias fueron creadas en 2009, tras la aprobación de la Ley Electoral n° 26 571. En la misma se definen básicamente dos cuestiones: cuáles partidos están habilitados a presentarse a las elecciones nacionales del 23 de octubre, que según la ley son aquellos que obtengan al menos el 1,5% de los votos válidamente emitidos en el distrito de que se trate para la respectiva categoría. También quedará definida la lista que representará a cada partido político, de ahí lo de interna abierta.


=== Resultados de las primarias ===


=== Partidos políticos inhabilitados ===

Los siguientes partidos políticos no pudieron presentarse en las elecciones presidenciales, dado que no alcanzaron el porcentaje de votos establecido para poder hacerlo.[41]​
Proyecto Sur
Alcira Argumedo: El Movimiento Proyecto Sur, liderado por el Diputado Nacional y candidato a la Jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Fernando Solanas, resolvió finalmente no adherir al Frente Amplio Progresista y concurrir a las elecciones presidenciales con listas propias. La candidatura está enmarcada en una coalición denominada Movimiento Proyecto Sur, conformada por el Partido Proyecto Sur, el Movimiento Socialista de los Trabajadores (MST), Humanismo y Liberación y el Partido Socialista Auténtico (PSA).[42]​
Movimiento de Acción Vecinal
Sergio Pastore: El candidato por un partido regional de Córdoba, de escasa importancia a nivel nacional, fue presentado a último momento.[43]​ El Partido de Acción Vecinal integra junto con el Partido Justicialista la alianza electoral regional Unión por Córdoba.[44]​ La candidata a vice es Gilda Rodríguez. Según un artículo en La Voz del Interior cuenta con el apoyo de la comunidad sirio-libanesa.[45]​
Partido del Campo Popular
José Bonacci: El partido nacionalista Partido del Campo Popular, el cual surgió de la fusión del Movimiento por la Dignidad y la Independencia (MODIN) con otros partidos de derecha, presentó a Bonacci, oriundo de la Provincia de Santa Fe, a último momento. Su candidato a vicepresidente es José Villena.[46]​[43]​

545,"Techno Viking (""Vikingo Tecno"") es un fenómeno de internet basado en un vídeo de la edición de 2000 de la Fuckparade en Berlín, Alemania.
El vídeo, de cuatro minutos y rodado por el artista experimental Matthias Fritsch en la Fuckparade el 8 de julio de 2000,[1]​ empieza con el título ""Kneecam No. 1"" y muestra un pequeño grupo de gente entre la que destaca un hombre musculoso y barbado, desnudo de cintura para arriba y luciendo un colgante del martillo de Thor. El personaje atrae la atención cuando agarra por los brazos a otro joven y le señala con el dedo en ademán admonitorio después de ver cómo el aludido salta sin cuidado de un camión y choca contra un joven con el pelo teñido de azul. Resuelto el disturbio, otro miembro de la Fuckparade ofrece al protagonista del vídeo una botella de agua invertida y éste, tras beber de ella, comienza a marchar calle abajo con el resto de la concurrencia mientras baila enérgicamente al son de música tecno.[2]​ Fritsch hizo público el vídeo con la intención de sembrar la duda en los espectadores sobre si aquella curiosidad era real o había sido preparada.[1]​
Fritsch subió el vídeo a internet en 2001.[3]​ En 2006 lo subió a YouTube, y el vídeo se volvió viral un año después. Según Fritsch, su popularidad comenzó en una página pornográfica centroamericana.[4]​ Tras ser posteado en Break.com, alcanzó el 28 de septiembre el millón de visitas por día y fue visto por más de diez millones en un período de seis meses. Más de 700 respuestas y versiones editadas aparecieron durante este tiempo.[1]​[5]​[6]​[7]​ Fue el vídeo número uno en la serie de tres episodios Drink and Drugs en Rude Tube.[8]​ Así mismo, Mathew Cullen y Weezer mostraron su intención de incluir al Techno Viking en su complicación de fenómenos de internet para su videoclip ""Pork and Beans"", aunque no pudo ser así.[9]​ El Techno Viking llegó a ser plasmado al óleo en una serie de obras de arte sobre fenómenos de internet.[10]​ A mediados de 2010, el vídeo había generado 20 millones de hits sólo en Youtube.[3]​ El vídeo fue articulizado en la página Know Your Meme, donde se recogieron imágenes derivadas del vídeo, en especial una con el Techno Viking apuntando con el dedo sobre la palabra ""Obey"" (""obedece""),[11]​ así como en la Encyclopedia Dramatica.
Fritsch fundó una página llamada Techno Viking Archive para ""investigar las estrategias de práctica participatoria en las redes sociales digitales""[12]​ y presentó ponencias sobre la acogida del vídeo. Su proyecto Music from the Masses fue inspirado por la experiencia del Techno Viking: explora la colaboración mediante vídeos sin sonido a fin de que otros artistas proporcionen audios y bandas sonoras.[1]​[3]​[6]​[12]​ En respuesta a acciones legales tomadas por el hombre representado en el vídeo, el acceso a éste ha sido restringido desde 2009.[1]​
Fritsch no conocía la identidad del hombre mientras rodaba el vídeo.[4]​[6]​[13]​ Se especuló ampliamente sobre su identidad: un participante del segmento de 2009 ""Bodybuilding"" del programa de televisión alemán Raab in Gefahr[14]​ fue señalado como un posible Techno Viking por un usuario de YouTube.[15]​ mientras que fans de las artes marciales mixtas creyeron identificar en él a Keith Jardine, por entonces luchador de la Ultimate Fighting Championship.[16]​
El 17 de enero de 2013 se abrió contra Fritsch un juicio por violación de derechos de imagen por parte del hombre representad en el vídeo, cuya identidad continuó anónima.[4]​[17]​[18]​ En junio, Fritsch fue obligado a pagar la cantidad de 13,000 euros en daños, sumada a la mayoría de sus ganancias en publicidad de YouTube y venta merchandising relacionada con el vídeo, y fue obligado a cesar la publicación de su imagen.[13]​[19]​[20]​[21]​[22]​ La decisión legal dejó a Fritsch endeudado,[20]​ y éste decidió atraer financiación por medio de crowdfunding para rodar un documental sobre el caso, The Story of Technoviking,[21]​ el cual fue estrenado en 2015.[23]​

550,"Ras Kass (nacido como John Austin el 26 de septiembre de 1972 en Watts, California) es un rapero norteamericano. Sus fans alaban su destreza técnica como MC y tanto la pasión por la música y su actitud comprometida queda patente en su contenido lírico.


== Carrera ==
Ras Kass debutó con Soul On Ice en 1996. El álbum desarrolló una considerable promoción mediante varios singles independientes, tales como ""High IQ"" y ""Won't Catch Me Runnin'"". Soul On Ice tuvo un éxito comercial pequeño, pero el álbum fue adorado dentro del hip hop underground, apreciado en ese momento por sus batallas raperas tan mordaces en el show de Sway & King Tech y su militancia afrocentrista. Después creó polémica con los temas ""Ordo Abchao"" y ""Nature Of The Threat"", donde detallaba la historia racista de blancos frente a negros. Muchos defendían que Ras fue al extremo del racismo contra los blancos, pero la mayoría de fans no lo vieron como una teoría o conspiración contra la raza blanca.
Lógicamente, Ras Kass tuvo la típica presión después de un gran estreno. Su segundo álbum, ""Rasassination"", obtuvo cierto éxito comercial, en parte, gracias a las colaboraciones de Xzibit y RZA, además de recibir ayuda de Dr. Dre, que produjo parte de los ritmos y rapeó en el single principal ""Ghetto Fabulous"". Por medio de este tema, llegó al público mainstream, donde muchos le criticaron por suavizar su contenido en beneficio del éxito comercial. El trabajo, de hecho, combina lo intelectual de sus letras (""Interview With A Vampire"" es una teológica y espiritual exploración donde Ras habla de las perspectivas de Dios, él mismo y el Diablo) con temas personales (""It Is What It Is"" habla de la relación con su madre). A pesar de esto, el álbum no vendió todo lo esperado.
El tercer álbum de Ras Kass, Van Gogh, tenía previsto para salir en 2001. Sin embargo, el álbum se filtró en internet meses antes de su salida, lo que hizo que Priority records retrasara su salida al mercado indefinidadamente. Esto hizo que se complicaran aún más las relaciones entre Ras Kass y el sello, relaciones que se rompieron poco después, cuando el disco ""Golden chyld"" (con temas de ""Van Gogh"" y temas nuevos grabados para la ocasión) también se retrasó indefinidamente.

551,"Nitzer Ebb (pronunciado naig-zer o nit-zer, la propia banda lo pronuncia de ambas formas) es un grupo británico de EBM formado en 1982 en Essex, por tres amigos del colegio, Douglas McCarthy (voz y teclado), Bon Harris (teclados y batería) y David Gooday.


== Comienzos ==
El trío comenzó sus actuaciones en pequeñas salas locales, pero su fuerte presencia en escena, su imagen militar y energía consiguieron una creciente base de seguidores que pronto condujo a actuaciones en clubs más grandes y conciertos en salas. Lanzaron su primer single de debut, ""Isn't It Funny How Your Body Works"", el 7 de enero de 1985, en su propio sello, Power of Voice Communication, y su música se convirtió pronto en obligada en los clubs. Le siguió el single de doble cara 'A' ""Warsaw Ghetto""/""So Bright So Strong"" en 1985, con críticas similares y aclamación en las pistas de baile. Dos lanzamientos posteriores, ""Let Your Body Learn""/""Get Clean"" y ""Murderous"" fueron editados en Power of Voice Communication antes de firmar con la Mute Records.


== Finales de los 80 y principios de los 90 ==
En mayo de 1987 lanzaron su álbum debut en Mute Records That Total Age, que convirtió en éxito los potentes ""Join In the Chant"" y ""Murderous"".
El segundo álbum, Belief fue lanzado en 1989. La banda iba ahora a un dúo entre Harris y McCarthy, con el apoyo de Julian Beeston en la batería. Tres álbumes más, Showtime en 1990, Ebbhead en 1991 y Big Hit en 1995 fueron, además, éxitos internacionales, cambiando la banda de las canciones de baile de 4/4 a 120bpm a otras formas musicales -jazz, rock, blues-, sonando aún como ellos mismos, o, como Douglas Mccarthy describibó en 1991, ""música de baile simplista"". Nitzer Ebb hallaron, además, el favor de sus compañeros de sello y pesos pesados internacionales Depeche Mode, que los invitaron a sus tours europeos en 1988, y en 1990 abriendo el World Violation Tour en EEUU. El actuar en grandes estadios llenos de gente y la propia intensidad del negocio les proporcionó la suficiente influencia para comenzar a desarrollar un estilo más orientado al rock en su música, y así en 1991 su EP As Is (producido por Jaz Coleman, de Killing Joke, Mark Ellis (Flood), Alan Wilder de Depeche Mode y Barry Adamson pusieron las semillas para el antes comentado Ebbhead


== Años recientes ==
El grupo dejó de operar hacia el final del tour Big Hit (las últimas actuaciones fueron canceladas). El grupo no se separó nunca de manera oficial, y la puerta quedó de hecho abierta para que Harris y McCarthy reactivaran la banda en un futuro, una vez que sus diferencias se hubiesen resuelto. NovaMute lanzó con posterioridad una serie de remixes con tres singles de 12 pulgadas entre el año 2001 y 2004 - Shame/Join in the Chant, Control I'm Here/Let Your Body Learn, y Murderous/Control I'm Here. La remezcla de Let Your Body Learn fue particularmente fructífera debido a la radical revisión por parte del productor francés de tecno Terence Fixmer, que llevó primero a una amistad y más tarde a un proyecto entre Fixmer y Douglas McCarthy, llamado, simplemente, Fixmer/McCarthy, con actuaciones en directo en shows en todo el mundo, que incluyen nuevas versiones de canciones de Nitzer Ebb. Esto llevó a la publicación de un álbum como Fixmer/McCarthy, titulado Between the Devil....
McCarthy vive en el este de Londres, trabajando como productor de video. Estudió diseño gráfico en Cambridge después de un par de colaboraciones con Alan Wilder en Recoil, y apareció en vivo con Empirion en 1997 en el Tribal Gathering. Harris vive en EE. UU., y produce para Marilyn Manson y Billy Corgan.
A finales del 2005 se anunció que McCarthy y Harris habían comenzado a hablar de la posibilidad de que Nitzer Ebb se volviese a juntar. El 2006 ha visto de nuevo en tour al grupo una vez más, centrándose en la etapa más electrónica de sus carreras, mientras que Mute lanzará la retrospectiva Body of Work, así como un álbum de remixes en NovaMute.
Igualmente, han sido nuevamente invitados por Depeche Mode como banda telonera durante la última fase del Tour of the universe en Europa.
En 2009, el grupo graba el disco ""Industrial Complex"", el primer disco desde 1995, el cual promocionarán junto a Depeche Mode hasta febrero, y junto a Recoil (Alan WIlder) a partir de marzo.

552,"Brus Laguna es un municipio del departamento de Gracias a Dios en la república de Honduras.


== Historia ==
El nombre Brus Laguna puede provenir de ""Brewer’s Lagoon"" o ""Bruss Lagoon"", en alusión a un pirata inglés de nombre Bloody Brewer (o Talira Brewer) quien estableció un fuerte en los cayos o islas de la laguna para atacar a los galeones españoles en el siglo XVII. Estas islas son históricamente conocidas como Wood Kika, hoy llamadas Cannon Islands o Cayos Cañones.
La localidad fue fundada en 1811, y el 5 de agosto de 1957 se erigió en municipio. El término municipal está conformado por 9 aldeas y 53 caseríos, que en total sumaban 9477 habitantes.
Actualmente la población del municipio es de aproximadamente 11.000 habitantes. La cabecera Brus Laguna cuenta con aproximadamente 7000 habitantes.[2]​

Al norte limita con el mar Caribe, al sur con Wampusirpe, al este con Juan Francisco Bulnes e Iriona Colón y al oeste con Ahuas. Sin embargo, Brus Laguna sufre un cierto aislamiento, pues no se puede acceder a ella ni por autopista ni por ferrocarril.


== Clima ==
Su clima es cálido, y las precipitaciones abundantes y regulares, de más de 3000 mm al año. Las temperaturas oscilan entre los 22 °C y los 30 °C. La vegetación de la zona es abundante, y la fauna silvestre de la zona es muy diversa.

554,"El M8 TOW es una versión modificada del M8 Greyhound por la compañía Napco Industries para el ejército colombiano. Los trabajos consistieron en cambiar el cañón de 37 mm por un sistema antitanque BGM-71 TOW, la instalación de una ametralladora M2 HB de 12,7 mm y el cambio de motores y caja.


== Historia ==
En 1981 el gobierno colombiano consideró en retirar del servicio los 46 tanques M3A1 Stuart que conformaban el grueso del arma blindada colombiana. Se presentó la licitación para la compra de 120 tanques de origen estadounidense M48 Patton pero solo se compraron 40 no eran suficientes para defender el país.
En 1982 y tras evidenciar su gran debilidad en materia de blindados, el Gobierno de Colombia se decidió a convertir un lote de sus M8 Greyhound en vehículos con capacidad cazacarros. La empresa norteamericana Napco Industries presentó un plan junto a su pliego de licitación; en donde especificaba las modificaciones a realizar para equiparlo y convertirlo hacia este rol, y los contratos se cerraron a finales de 1984.


== Modificaciones ==
Se cambia su armamento original: un cañón de 37 mm AP por un sistema BGM-71 TOW
Instalación de Sistemas de Tiro del misil TOW: telémetros, guías y alzas de miras
Se le ha añadido una ametralladora Browning M2HB de 12,7 mm (.50) con su respectivo afuste y ronza sobre la torreta
El motor fue sustituido por un Detroit Diesel H1 con caja Allison dual


== Misiones asignadas ==
Los M8 TOW han sido asignados en su totalidad al batallón Cartagena, apostados en La Guajira con la intención de salvaguardar las fronteras colombianas ante un ataque de tanques proveniente desde la frontera norte.

555,"Canguros fue una serie de televisión cómica española emitida por Antena 3 entre los años 1994 y 1995.[1]​
La serie cuenta las peripecias de Alicia, personaje interpretado por Maribel Verdú, una joven estudiante de Medicina originaria de Almazán que se dedica a ser canguro (cuidadora de niños) en sus horas libres. Comparte piso con tres alocadas compañeras: Almudena (Ana Risueño), Rita (Silvia Marsó) y Sara (Lia Chapman). En la segunda temporada Rita deja la casa y su lugar es ocupado por Nancy (Paula Vázquez), mientras que en la tercera temporada el hueco de Sara es cubierto por Helena (Mar Flores).
Alicia tiene tres novios a la vez en la serie, lo que genera numerosos malentendidos en su día a día: Micky (Luis Merlo), Eugenio (Blas Moya) y Jorge (Xabier Elorriaga). Este último desaparece al comienzo de la segunda temporada y Alicia completa su terna de amantes con Fermín (Francis Lorenzo).
Otros personajes recurrentes son Amparo (Carmen Balagué), Fede (Fede Celada), el Casero (Santiago Segura) o el Policía (Félix Cubero).
Además, actores como Aarón Guerrero, Jimmy Castro, Yohana Cobo, Alicia Beisner, Álvaro Monje, Lidia San José o Dafne Fernández, luego más populares por sus trabajos en otras series o películas, participaron en ésta como niños de los que cuidaba la protagonista.
Antena 3 repuso Canguros en 2003. Ya en 2006, una década después de su estreno, en uno de sus canales de Televisión Digital Terrestre, Antena.Neox.
El canal autonómico Popular CLM recuperó la serie en noviembre de 2014 en el horario de la sobremesa, de Lunes a Viernes a las 15.00h
La serie fue escrita por una nueva generación de guionistas que no procedía de TVE, entre los que estaban Chus Gutiérrez, Juanjo Díaz Polo, Miguel Ángel Fernández y Joaquín Górriz.

556,"Diego Fernández (antes del 1 de diciembre de 928),[1]​ fue un conde en el Reino de León cuya filiación no ha sido documentada, aunque por su patronímico su padre se llamaría Fernando[2]​ y probablemente fuera originario de Castilla.[3]​ Es el ancestro de varios linajes importantes de los siglos siglo x y siglo xi en la Península Ibérica.[4]​ Aunque el parentesco no está confirmado en las fuentes medievales, algunos historiadores y genealogistas opinan que pudo ser hermano del conde Ero[5]​[6]​ y de Gudesteo Fernández.[1]​


== Esbozo biográfico ==

Diego llegó al condado portucalense al final del siglo siglo ix acompañanado, según Sampiro, al infante Bermudo Ordóñez, hijo del rey Ordoño I de Asturias, que después de rebelarse contra su hermano Alfonso III, se exilió en Coímbra donde falleció poco antes de 928.[7]​ Su primera aparición en cartularios medievales fue el 28 de abril de 909 cuando confirmó una donación del rey Alfonso III.[7]​ Fue también miembro de la curia regia del rey Ordoño II de León y de su sucesor Fruela II.[8]​ Acompañó después al rey Ramiro II cuando estableció su corte en Viseu y su última aparición se registra el 23 de febrero de 926 cuando confirmó una donación del rey Ramiro al conde Hermenegildo González y a su esposa Muniadona Díaz, hija de Diego.[9]​ Habrá fallecido entre esa fecha y antes del 1 de diciembre de 928 cuando su esposa otorgó testamento y declaró que era viuda.[3]​


== Matrimónio y descendencia ==
El conde Diego contrajo matrimonio con Oneca (u Onega), quien, debido a una confusión con una descendiente, se confunde frecuentemente con su homónima Oneca Lúcidez, hija de Lucídio Vimaranes, a su vez, hijo de Vímara Pérez, conquistador de Coímbra. Se conjetura que Oneca pudo haber sido miembro de la casa real pamplonesa, debido a su nombre, de origen navarro, y el de su hijo Jimeno y varios descendientes.[10]​ Su madre pudo ser Leodegundia, probable hija del rey Ordoño I de Asturias, casada con un infante o noble pamplonés, ya que en un diploma, el rey Ramiro II llama tía a Munia, hija del matrimonio de Diego y Oneca.[3]​ En diciembre de 928, Oneca aparece haciendo una donación al monasterio de Lorvão acompañada por sus cuatro hijos, todos mencionados:Munia, Ledegundia, Ximeno y Mummadomna, así como el conde Hermenegildo González, esposo de su hija Mumadona, y Rodrigo Tedóniz, posiblemente el marido de Leodegundia Díaz. La donación la realizó por el alma de Veremudo dive memorie que ha sido confundido frecuentemente con el rey Bermudo II de León, aunque en realidad se refiere al infante Bermudo Ordóñez, hijo de Ordoño II que vivió en el condado Portucalense y que probablemente fue hermano de Leodegundia, la que pudo ser la madre de Oneca.[11]​
De este matrimonio nacieron:
Munia Díaz,[12]​ esposa de Aloyto (Alvito) Lucides, padres de Lucídio Alvites quien casó con Jimena y fueron los padres de Oneca (Onega) Lucides, la homónima frecuentemente confundida con Oneca, la esposa de Diego Fernández.[13]​
Leodegundia Díaz,[12]​ posiblemente la esposa de Rodrigo Tedoniz, quien también confirma la donación efectuada en 928.[4]​
Jimeno Díaz (falleció entre noviembre y diciembre de 961),[12]​, conde y personaje muy relevante del siglo siglo x, quien antes de febrero de 949 contrajo matrimonio con Adosinda Gutiérrez, hija del conde Gutierre Menéndez y de Ilduara Ériz con quien tuvo sucesión. Después de enviudar, Adosinda se casó con Ramiro Menéndez, hijo del conde Hermenegildo González.[10]​ Algunos autores consideran que la reina Velasquita Ramírez pudo ser la hija de Ramiro Menéndez y de Adosinda.[14]​
Muniadona Díaz, quien aparece en febrero de 926 ya casada con el conde Hermenegildo González.[15]​[16]​[4]​

557,"Han (chino tradicional: 韓, Wade-Giles: Han2, pinyin: Hán) (403 a. C.-230 a. C.) fue un reino de la época de los Reinos Combatientes en China. No ha de ser confundido con Corea del Sur que comparte el mismo carácter.
Su territorio bloqueaba el paso directo al Estado Qin en las llanuras del norte de China, convirtiéndose en objetivo frecuente de las expediciones Qin. A pesar de las reformas realizadas en Han para fortalecer su poder, sobre todo bajo el famoso legalista Shen Buhai, nunca vencería a Qin. De hecho fue el primero de los seis reinos en ser conquistador por Qin.
La invasión de Han por Qin en la provincia de Shangdang (上黨) llevó a la batalla más sangrienta de todo el período, Changping, en el 260 a. C.
Inicialmente sus gobernantes se titulaban vizcondes (子, zǐ) pero tras volverse soberanos en rey Zhou les reconoció como marqueses (侯, hóu). Finalmente, desde 323 a. C. se denominaron reyes (王, Wáng).


== Cumbre ==
De acuerdo con el Shiji,[1]​ la familia Han desciende de los reyes Zhou. Estos entregaron Hanyuan (韓原) a la familia Han, desde el cual ganarían poder e influencia. En el 403 a. C., el Marqués Jing de Han (韓景侯), junto con el Marqués Wen de Wei y el Marqués Lie de Zhao, dividieron el estado Jin en tres: Han, Wei y Zhao, hecho con el que comenzaría el período de los Reinos Combatientes y la independencia política de Han. El Rey Lie de Zhou fue obligado a reconocer los nuevos estados, elevando a la categoría de marqueses a sus gobernantes.


== Apogeo ==
El apogeo de Han llegó durante el gobierno del Marqués Xi que nombró a Shen Buhai (申不害) canciller y siguió las doctrinas legalistas. Las políticas de Shen fortalecieron al reino que se convirtió en una sociedad xiaokang.


== Caída ==
Debido a la naturaleza de la escisión de Jin, el estado de Han se encontraba rodeado por otros poderosos estados como Chu, Qin, y Wei. Han era el más pequeño de los siete estados y fue sobrepasado militarmente por sus poderosos vecinos. Llegó a perder la capacidad de defenderse por sí mismo, necesitando el apoyo de sus vecinos hasta la conquista por Qin en el 230 a. C.


== Personajes Ilustres ==
El personaje más importante de Han es el filósofo legalista Han Fei. Otro personaje famoso fue Zhang Liang, que ayudó en la fundación de la Dinastía Han.

558,"Manuela Villarán de Plasencia (n. Lima, 1840 – m. Lima, 1888) fue una poeta y periodista peruana. Su poesía fue festiva e ingeniosa.


== Biografía ==
Nació dentro del seno de una familia limeña distinguida por sus méritos literarios y cívicos. Sus padres fueron Manuel Vicente Villarán González y Nicolasa Angulo Jiménez. Se casó el 13 de noviembre de 1854 con Rafael Plasencia Muñoz Fuentes, capitán del batallón «Ayacucho».
Formó parte de la «primera generación de mujeres ilustradas en el Perú», que incursionaron en el periodismo y la literatura a partir de la década de 1870. Colaboró así en diversas revistas y semanarios, como El Álbum, La Alborada, El Parnaso Peruano, entre otros.
Fue asistente asidua a las tertulias literarias presididas en Lima por la escritora argentina Juana Manuela Gorriti, entre los años 1876 y 1877. Se realizaban aquellas en la casa Nº 188 de la calle de Urrutia (esquina con Pilitricas, hoy Jirón Ocoña), y entre sus asistentes figuraban Cristina Bustamante, Adriana de Buendía, Mercedes Cabello de Carbonera, Rosa Mendiburu de Palacios, Clorinda Matto de Turner, y los escritores varones Ricardo Palma, Adolfo García, Numa Pompilio Llona, Acisclo Villarán y Abelardo Gamarra. Manuela dedicó un poema «A la eminente escritora Juana Manuela Gorriti» en el que se alude a la estrecha relación entre ésta y sus jóvenes discípulas.
Durante la guerra con Chile perdió a su único hijo Ernesto Plasencia, lo que le motivó una magistral elegía titulada «A Ernesto». Falleció pocos años después, a la temprana edad de 48 años.

561,"Les Djinns fue una agrupación coral francesa, compuesta por 60 jovencitas cuyas edades fluctuaban entre los 15 y 16 años. Hicieron su aparición en el año de 1959 acompañadas por la Gran Orquesta de París bajo la dirección de Paul Bonneau. Varias de ellas iniciaron su formación musical en la ""Maîtrise de Radio France"" (l'ORTF/RTF), donde educaron y entrenaron su voz desde muy jóvenes.
Grabaron numerosos temas conocidos internacionalmente, contando entre su repertorio con canciones como: ""Moulin rouge"", ""Et maintenant"", ""La mer"", ""C'est beau la vie"", ""C'est si bon"", etc., que cantaban simultáneamente otros artistas de la época. Muchas de las composiciones fueron éxitos de Jean Ferrat, Charles Trenet y Gilbert Bécaud., este último fue su padrino musical.
En los Estados Unidos se dieron a conocer como ""Les Djinns Singers"" y en México se les conoció como ""Las Voces del Cielo"", título que honoríficamente describe su singular estilo interpretativo y gran calidad vocal.
Ducretet Thomson, la firma discográfica que lanzó a esta coral prodigiosa, las ha descrito como ""la coral que en forma excelsa aborda las ensoñadoras tonalidades de un mundo celeste, construyendo un paraíso de ilusiones en cada uno de los temas que interpretan"". Discos Gamma, la compañía disquera que las dio a conocer en México, hizo lo mismo al afirmar: ""Oírlas cantar es un verdadero placer auditivo y un exquisito regalo a los sentidos"".
Les Djinns se hicieron ganadoras en su época del ""Grand Prix du Disque"" en Francia y su fama traspasó hace mucho tiempo las fronteras francesas.

567,"La riva (en plural, rive) es un elemento característico del urbanismo de Venecia, Italia.


== Rive portuarias ==
En la toponimia de la ciudad el término riva está reservado a las fondamente que bordean el Gran Canal y la cuenca de San Marcos. En los tiempos de la República de Venecia las rive actuales eran muelles para el atraque de las naves mercantiles que comerciaban en la cuenca del Mediterráneo. Por este motivo las rive se caracterizan por una anchura mucho mayor respecto a la de las fondamente ordinarias y no tienen barandillas.
Las rive más famosas son la Riva di Biasio o di Biagio, la Riva del Vin y la Riva del Carbón a lo largo del Gran Canal; y la Riva degli Schiavoni y la Riva dei Sette Martiri a lo largo dela cuenca de San Marcos.


== Rive de amarre ==
El término riva se usa también para designar los amarres situados a lo largo de las orillas de los rii. Habitualmente se trata de pequeñas escalinatas realizadas en piedra de Istria que terminan directamente en el agua, cuyo objetivo es facilitar el acceso a las embarcaciones en las diferentes condiciones de marea. Con frecuencia las escalinatas de las rive están dotadas de un escalón-plataforma situado aproximadamente a mitad de la escalera para facilitar las operaciones de carga y descarga de bienes y la subida y el descenso de los pasajeros de las embarcaciones que atracan allí.
Hay tres tipos de rive:[1]​
la riva con escalones paralelos al curso del rio
la riva con escalones perpendiculares al curso del rio
la riva que termina una calle o un sotoportego que conduce hacia el agua
Las rive con escalones perpendiculares se han aprovechado también por motivos arquitectónicos, para resaltar o dar monumentalidad a la iglesia o al palacio frente al que están situados. Ejemplos típicos de este uso, práctico y decorativo al mismo tiempo, son las rive frente a la iglesia de los Jesuatos, frente a la Basílica de Santa Maria della Salute y frente a la iglesia de los Tolentini.

572,"La tenture de l' Histoire du Roy est une suite de quatorze tapisseries réalisée à la Manufacture des Gobelins à l'initiative de Charles Le Brun et de Jean-Baptiste Colbert pour montrer les premières années du roi Louis XIV, entre 1654 et 1668.


== Histoire ==
L'hôtel des Gobelins, le long de la Bièvre, dans le faubourg Saint-Marcel de Paris est acheté par Colbert le 6 juin 1662.
Charles Le Brun a été anobli en décembre 1662, puis nommé directeur de la Manufacture des Gobelins en 1663 et Premier peintre du roi en 1664. Il avait commencé à réaliser en 1660 une Histoire d'Alexandre à la demande de Louis XIV pour orner les châteaux royaux et reproduits en tapisserie. Assez rapidement Colbert et Louis XIV ont eu l'idée de relater en une suite de tapisseries les évènements glorieux des premières années du règne de Louis XIV. Des suites de tapisseries semblables avaient déjà été faites : tenture Les Chasses de Maximilien, tenture des Fêtes des Valois ou de la Vie d'Henri III, des scènes de la vie de Laurent le Magnifique, etc.
Le château de Versailles expose les tapisseries de cette suite comprenant des pièces des troisième et de la sixième suites de la tenture déposées par le Mobilier national en 1908.


== Description de la tenture ==
1- Les informations sont données pour la première suite de tapisseries de la tenture à fils d'or réalisée sur les dessins de Charles Le Brun et Adam Frans Van der Meulen. Elle a été réalisée en haute-lisse et livrée au Garde-Meuble de la Couronne en deux fois, les douze premières en 1676 ou 1677, les deux dernières en 1681.
En 1789, cette tenture est à Paris. En 1792, 8 pièces de cette tenture est au Garde-Meuble. En 1808, elle se trouve au magasin des Gobelins, en 16 pièces, en effet, aux 14 pièces initiales ont été ajoutées deux pièces dans l'inventaire du Garde-Meuble : la ""Construction des Invalides"" et le ""Baptême du Dauphin"". L'inventaire donne pour les dimensions de l'ensemble : 5,02 m de hauteur et 112,63 m de longueur. En 1900, les 14 pièces sont au Garde-Meuble.
2- Une deuxième tenture à fils d'or a été commencée à la demande de Colbert mais a été arrêtée par Louvois, successeur de Colbert, en 1683. Seules trois pièces ont été tissées. En 1789 et 1792, ces trois pièces sont au Garde-Meuble, à Paris, avec l'indication : superbes. Elles sont toujours au Garde-Meuble en 1900.
3- Une troisième tenture à fils d'or est entreprise en basse lisse. Elle comprend 13 pièces. Elle a été presque entièrement réalisée dans l'atelier de Jean Mozin. Des premiers paiements pour cette tenture apparaissent dans les Comptes des Bâtiments, en 1670, mais la tapisserie de la ""Visite du Roy aux Gobelins"" n'est pas terminée en 1694. Elle a dû être achevée en 1714. En 1789, elle est dispersée entre le palais du Louvre et le palais de Luxembourg. En 1792, elle est toujours dispersée et seules deux pièces sont au Garde-Meuble. En 1900, deux pièces sont manquantes : ""Prise de Douai"" et la ""Satisfaction donnée par l'Espagne"".
4- Une quatrième tenture à fils d'or est entreprise aux Gobelins, en haute lisse, sauf une qui est tissée en basse lisse. Elle est commencée en 1704. La dernière pièce est livrée en janvier 1715. Elle comprend au total 20 pièces car six sont des entre-fenêtres composés de la partie centrale des grands tableaux.
En 1723, sur ordre du roi, quatre grandes pièces à fils d'or et quatre entre-fenêtres sont données au duc de Brunswick. Elles ont dû être détruites dans l'incendie du château de Brunswick, le 7 septembre 1830.
En 1726, dix grandes pièces et deux entre-fenêtres sont livrées au duc de Saint-Aignan pour son ambassade à Rome. Ces pièces sont complétées par huit pièces réalisées de 1725 et 1731. Elles son renvoyées au directeur des Bâtiments, à Paris, en 1742, par De Troy, directeur de l'Académie de France à Rome, mais il manquait 3 pièces qui été restées à Paris pour décorer l'hôtel particulier du duc de Saint-Aignan. Il reste alors à Paris, 12 grandes pièces et 6 entre-fenêtres. Puis les 12 grandes pièces sont prêtées en 1744 au cardinal de la Rochefoucauld pour son ambassade à Rome. Elles sont restées à Rome jusqu'au 1er janvier 1791. En 1793, les pièces de l'ambassade de France à Rome sont dans l'hôtel du cardinal de Bernis car il considérait qu'elles appartenaient au roi, puis ces pièces disparaissent. Une pièces, ""Alliance des Suisses"" est réapparue en vente en 1896 et achetée par le gouvernement suisse. En 1900, des 20 pièces initiales, il ne reste plus dans l'inventaire du Garde-Meuble qu'une grande pièce et un entre-fenêtre.
5- Une cinquième tenture sans or est réalisée en haute lisse entre 1716 et 1730. Elle comprend trois pièces : ""Construction des Invalides"", ""Doge de Gênes"", ""Baptême du Dauphin"". Une pièce est donnée au duc de Brunswick en 1726, les deux autres sont livrées au Garde-Meuble en 1744. Elles sont toujours au Garde-Meuble en 1900.
6- Une sixième tenture à fils d'or, en basse lisse, est réalisée entre 1729 et 1736. Elle comprend 14 pièces et 2 entre-fenêtres. La tenture est restée jusqu'à la Révolution dans le magasin des Gobelins.
7- Une septième et dernière tenture, sans or, en basse lisse, est entreprise à partir de 1736. Elle est arrêtée en 1742. Elle ne comprend que 6 pièces.

574,"Le bombardement d'Alger de 1784 est une opération militaire espagnole menée en 1784 par Antoine Barcelo suite à son échec l'année précedente.


== Historique ==
L'opération est en réalité une large coalition de navires d'Espagne, du Portugal, de Malte, de Naples et de Toscane qui forme une escadre de 130 navires. Les navires mal dirigés n'infligent pas de dégâts significatifs à la ville, à peine touchent-ils quelques maisons. La défense algérienne est plus efficace, les batteries du port entretiennent un feu nourri.
Elle se solde par un échec espagnol face aux défenses de la ville d'Alger et l'escadre rentre en Espagne pour se disperser. Combiné aux échecs de l'expédition de 1775, et de 1783 ils mettent l'Espagne dans une position de négociation difficile vis à vis du gouvernement algérien. Les expéditions espagnoles ayant quasiment toutes connues un dénouement catastrophique, les Algériens emploient le terme de Spagnolata en Lingua franca pour désigner une entreprise militaire mal conçue, exécutée sans art et sans énergie.
Le dey Mohamed Ben Othmane demande ainsi une indemnité de 1 000 000 pesos pour conclure une paix en 1785. A la suite s'ouvre une première période de négociation (1785-87) pour aboutir à une paix durable entre Alger et Madrid.

En effet, en 1952, c’était sous le nom de « Cercle Féminin Clermontois » qu’elle était reconnue. A cette date, l’association comptait alors cent quarante six licenciés et onze équipes disputant les différents championnats (U.F.O.L.E.P : Union fédérale des Œuvres Laïques et de l’Education Permanente, et, F.F.B.B : Fédération Française de Basket-ball). Cette section est née de la fusion de la section « civile » de l’I.R.E.P. (anciennement U.F.R.S.T.A.P.S.) et de la section féminine de l’Amicale Laïque et Sportive de St Jacques (quartier de Clermont-Ferrand). Celle-ci était alors affiliée à de l’Enseignement, Confédération Générale des Œuvres Laïques.
A la création de cette association, le président était M. René MINARD et elle comptait douze membres administratifs. De plus, cette section regroupait quatre équipes seniors (à partir de 18 ans), une équipe junior (désignation d’équipe qui n’existe plus aujourd’hui), une équipe cadette (entre 15 ans et 18 ans) et une équipe minime (entre 13 ans et 15 ans).
Dans le championnat U.F.O.L.E.P. qui avait à l’époque dix neuf ans d’existence, le « Cercle Féminin Clermontois » a totalisé vingt sept titres seniors, quatorze titres juniors, douze en cadettes, seize en minimes et un en benjamines.
En ce qui concerne le championnat F.F.B.B., les clermontoises ont conquis pendant la même période treize titres seniors, huit juniors, sept cadettes, huit minimes et un  en benjamines.
 Puis, au cours de la saison 1971-72, l’association du « Cercle Féminin Clermontois » décide d’abandonner cette appellation afin de rejoindre une autre association déjà mise en place depuis 1906 : le « Stade Clermontois ». A la tête de cette nouvelle section de basket féminin, on retrouvera encore M. René MINARD accompagné de seize membres administratifs. Le nombre d’équipes est alors de neuf et le nombre de licenciés de cent trois, baisse pouvant s’expliquer par la montée en puissance d’autres associations telles que le C.U.C.(Clermont Université Club) et l’A.S.M.(Association Sportive Montferrandaise). Cependant, pour la saison 1985/1986 l’association, sous de Bernard GRANET, affiche ses ambitions : accéder au plus haut niveau c’est-à-dire en Nationale 1. Le « Stade Clermontois » est donc à la tête du basket féminin Auvergnat ce qui lui permet d’acquérir une solide réputation au niveau des jeunes avec de très nombreux titres départementaux, régionaux et nationaux.
Saison 1986/1987, accession en NF1, entraîneur Michel BORDELIER.
Saisons 1987/1988/1989/1990 Entraîneur Paul BESSON
Saisons 1990/1991 Entraîneurs : Claude Pallanca/Libor DVORAK 
Le  6 décembre 1991 l’association  Basket féminin du « Stade Clermontois » décide de devenir indépendante tout en gardant un contact direct avec le « Stade Clermontois Omnisports »ainsi,   née le SCAB63 (Stade Clermontois Auvergne Basket 63)

=== Les années 2000 ===

Le SCAB était descendu en 1997 au deuxième échelon du championnat, en même temps que les voisines de l'AS Montferrand. Entre-temps le championnat féminin s'est reformaté; l'élite est devenue la Ligue féminine de basket et le SCAB63 est en NF1. Les scabistes vont découvrir la LFB pour la saison 2002-03, mais n'y resteront qu'une saison. En 2003-2004, c'est à la 3e place que le SCAB63 achève son championnat de NF1, devant elles, Strasbourg et le Centre Fédéral. Ces dernières ne pouvant accéder (par convention auprès de la Ligue) à l'élite, c'est donc Clermont-Ferrand qui retrouve la LFB, un an après l'avoir quitté. Par la même occasion Paoline Salagnac est élue MVP de NF1.
Déterminé à ne plus faire l'ascenseur, le SCAB ne lâche aucun match en 2004-05 et parvient finalement à accrocher une 5e place de saison régulière, puis 7e place finale. Le maintien est largement assuré, mais mieux le SCAB se retrouve qualifié pour l'Eurocoupe la saison suivante.
Pour une première participation à l'Eurocoupe (créée en 2003'), le SCAB se retrouve dans le groupe L en compagnie des Allemandes du BG Dorsten, des Italiennes de Maddaloni et des Espagnoles de Halcón Avenida. Cette rude concurrence n'empêche pas les auvergnates de se sortir de la phase de poule avec un bilan de 3 victoires et 3 défaites. En 16e de finale, les louves arvernes écopent d'un adversaire bien rompu aux joutes européennes, le MBK Ružomberok, et la courte victoire à domicile (67-66 le 8 décembre 2005) ne leur suffit pas pour passer ce tour, puisqu'elles s'inclinent en Slovaquie une semaine plus tard (93-77). En championnat de LFB, le SCAB se qualifie pour les playoffs en terminant la saison à la 9e position. Mais l'aventure se termine dès le premier tour (8e de finale), défait en deux manches par Mourenx.
À l'inter-saison, le SCAB63 accuse les départs de Yacine Sene qui retourne à Aix-en-Provence, de Petra Štampalija qui rejoint l'Italie et La Spezia, de Ndeye Ndiaye et de Andra Mandache, mais enregistre les arrivées de Dawn Chriss (Virginia Tech), de Pauline Krawczyk(championne d'Europe des moins de 20 ans avec l'équipe de France, CJM Bourges Basket), de Bélinda M'Boma (Club Basket d'Ifs), de Edyta Nadrowska et enfin de Andrea Gardner (qui a joué 2 ans avec le Seattle Storm en WNBA).
Avril 2007 marque une petite révolution dans l'histoire du club avec les départs coup sur coup de l'entraîneur Pascal Dellaliaux et de la joueuse emblématique Paoline Salagnac.

579,"Tsaparang était la capitale de l'ancien royaume de Gugé dans la vallée de Garuda, où coule la haute Sutlej, dans la Province de Ngari au Tibet occidental, près de la frontière du Ladakh. Elle se situe 278 kilomètres à l'ouest de Ali (Shiquanhe) et 18 kilomètres à l'ouest du monastère de Tholing du XIe siècle et à proximité à l'ouest du mont Kailash et du lac Manasarovar.
Elle est proche du monastère de Gurugem (Bön).
Tsaparang est une immense forteresse perchée sur un rocher en forme de pyramide d'une hauteur de 150 à 200 m en haut d'un long et étroit éperon. Il comprend de nombreux tunnels et grottes qui ont été taillés dans le rocher. À sa base, se trouvait une petite ville. Au-dessus d'eux, se trouvaient 2 temples publics - le Lhakhang Marpo (la chapelle rouge) et le Lhakhang Karpo (la chapelle blanche), et les quartiers monastiques. Plus haut, montant par un escalier en pierre en spirale dans un tunnel, se trouvaient les quartiers royaux, et tout en haut, le palais d'été.


== Histoire ==
Selon certaines sources, Tsaparang fut transformé en la capitale d'un royaume de Gugé par Namde Wosung, un des fils de Langdharma (838-841), un roi anti-bouddhiste du Tibet, après qu'il fut assassiné. Le Tibet était fait de plusieurs royaumes indépendants souvent en guerre les uns contre les autres. D'autres sources affirment que deux petits-fils de Langdharma se sont enfuis au Tibet occidental vers l'an 919. L'aîné, Nyima Gon, s'est établi à Purang et a conquis un grand secteur y compris le Ladakh et des parties du Spiti. Après sa mort, son royaume a été divisé entre ses 3 fils en 3 royaumes de Gugé, Purang, et de Maryul (= Ladakh).
Gugé contrôlait une route de commerce ancienne entre l'Inde et le Tibet. Il a émergé dans la région connu auparavant sous le nom de Zhangzhung et est devenu un pouvoir régional important au Xe siècle.
au XIe siècle, le roi Yeshe-Ö (en), en collaboration avec le fameux traducteur de Sanskrit, Rinchen Zangpo (Le Grand Traducteur""), et le maître indien Atisha, réintroduit le bouddisme au Tibet occidental. Rapidement Tsaparang, et Tholing, construits en terre cuite, y furent édifiés, avec des temples et des monastères. L'influence du Royaume de Gugé, plus particulièrement du centre monastique de Tholing, se fit sentir du Cachemire jusqu'en Assam.
En août 1624, un prêtre et un frère jésuites, Antonio de Andrada et Manuel Marques, cherchant le pays où, disait-on, se trouvaient d'anciennes communautés chrétiennes, arrivent à Tsaparang. Ils obtinrent la permission du roi de Gugé de prêcher dans son royaume. Revenus à Tsaparang l'été suivant ils construisirent une église au pied de la citadelle. Une autre mission fut ouverte à Rudok à 200 km de là. Nommé supérieur à Goa Antonio de Andrade quitta Tsaparang en 1630, peu avant que le roi ne soit renversé. Des troubles s'ensuivirent qui mirent fin à la mission.
En 1640, Manuel Marques tenta de revenir à Tsaparang mais il fut fait prisonnier. Jusqu'en 1641 un père jésuite resta à Srinagar (Garhwal) pour négocier sa libération, mais sans succès. On n'en eut plus de nouvelles.
En 1685, Tsaparang fut conquis par des mercenaires musulmans engagés par le roi bouddhiste du Ladakh.
En dépit des graves dommages causés par les gardes rouges durant la révolution culturelle, dont la destruction de la plupart des statues et peintures murales dans les deux chapelles, de nombreuses fresques magnifiques ont survécu.

580,"Titus Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus (mort après 285) était un haut dignitaire de l'Empire romain. Il servit sous les règnes des empereurs Carin et Dioclétien.
Aristobulus était le Préfet du prétoire de Carin et son collègue au consulat pour l'année 285. Cette année-là fut aussi celle de la rébellion de Dioclétien. Aristobulus participa aux côtés de Carin à la bataille du Margus qui vit la mort de l'empereur et assit le pouvoir de Dioclétien sur l'Empire romain.
Après cette défaite, Aristobulus conserva néanmoins son consulat et la préfecture du Prétoire et devint proconsul de la province d'Afrique et préfet de la Ville. Selon certains, ces charges furent la récompense de sa trahison vis-à-vis de Carin à la bataille du Margus. Certaines sources rapportent au contraire que l'armée de Carin abandonna l'empereur.

583,"Jean VII est un prince de la maison d'Oldenbourg né le 9 septembre 1540 à Oldenbourg et mort le 12 novembre 1603 à Oldenbourg. Il règne sur le comté d'Oldenbourg de 1573 à sa mort.


== Biographie ==
Jean VII est le fils aîné du comte Antoine Ier et de son épouse Sophie de Saxe-Lauenbourg. De 1552 à 1557, il est éduqué à Copenhague, à la cour du roi Christian III de Danemark, auprès de ses cousins les princes Frédéric, Magnus et Jean. Il entame ensuite son Grand Tour, qui le conduit à la cour de l'électeur Auguste Ier de Saxe. Il participe à plusieurs campagnes militaires au Danemark et en Suède et reçoit l'Ordre de l'Éléphant.
Jean VII succède à son père en janvier 1573. Deux ans plus tard, il hérite de la seigneurie de Jever (de) à la mort de Marie de Jever (de), qui lui lègue ses terres pour éviter qu'elles ne tombent entre les mains des comtes de Frise orientale. Ce gain s'avère important sur le plan stratégique, en renforçant les positions de l'Oldenbourg contre la Frise orientale, mais aussi en termes économiques : le pays de Jever est en effet riche en terres cultivables et en élevages de chevaux et de bétail. Il commence la construction d'une grande chaussée, la chaussée d'Ellens (de), afin de relier Jever à Oldenbourg. Cet ouvrage est achevé quelques années après sa mort, sous le règne de son fils Antoine-Gonthier. Il vaut à Jean VII le surnom (der Deichbauer), « le Bâtisseur de Digues ».
Jean VII organise l'Église luthérienne dans ses États. En 1573, il nomme superintendant le réformateur Hermann Hamelmann (de), qui rédige la règle ecclésiastique qui prévaut par la suite en Oldenbourg.
En 1577, le frère cadet de Jean VII, Antoine II, obtient le partage des États familiaux : Jean conserve Oldenbourg, mais il doit céder à Antoine le comté de Delmenhorst (de). Les deux comtés sont réunis en 1647, sous le règne d'Antoine-Gonthier, lorsque le fils d'Antoine II, Christian IX, meurt sans laisser de fils.


== Mariage et descendance ==
Jean VII épouse Élisabeth de Schwarzbourg (1541-1612), fille du comte Gonthier XL de Schwarzbourg (de), le 29 juillet 1576 à Delmenhorst. Six enfants sont nés de cette union :
Jean (1578-1580) ;
Anne (1579-1639) ;
Élisabeth (1581-1619) ;
Catherine (1582-1644), épouse en 1633 le duc Auguste de Saxe-Lauenbourg ;
Antoine-Gonthier (1583-1667), comte d'Oldenbourg ;
Madeleine (1585-1657), épouse en 1612 le prince Rodolphe d'Anhalt-Zerbst.

584,"Command & Conquer : Soleil de Tiberium (« Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun » en version originale) est un jeu vidéo de stratégie temps réel sorti en 1999 sur PC. Le jeu a été développé par Westwood Studios puis édité par Electronic Arts. Cet épisode sera le dernier de la série, réalisé par Westwood Studios, avant sa fermeture en 2003.
Une extension, Missions Hydre, également développée par Westwood Studios est sortie en mars 2000.
Le 12 février 2010, Electronic Arts a placé le jeu et son extension en téléchargement gratuit.


== Scénario ==
Le scénario est plus élaboré que dans les précédents jeux. L'action prend place environ trente ans après la fin du Conflit du Tiberium. Le 2 septembre 2030, Kane, que tout le monde croyait mort dans la destruction du Temple du Nod à l'issue de la précédente guerre, réapparaît et lance sa Confrérie de Nod contre le Groupement de Défense International. Il prétend avoir vu l'avenir de l'humanité mêlé avec le tiberium.
Le joueur interprète un personnage dans chaque campagne (Anton Slavik pour le Nod et Mc Neil pour le GDI).
L'univers de Command and Conquer : Soleil de Tiberium est le plus sombre de la série.


== Développement ==
L'équipe de développement, composée de vingt cinq membres permanents et de quinze membres à temps partiel, commença à travailler sur le projet vers mi-1996, juste après Alerte rouge. Leur but dans ce nouvel opus était de conserver le gameplay et l'ambiance du Command and Conquer original ; par chance, il s'agissait quasiment entièrement de la même équipe. Les développeurs ont tout de même modifié la vue pour une trois-quart plongée donnant un meilleur effet de perspective, sans utiliser la vraie 3D polygonale, trop gourmande pour l'époque. Il leur a été difficile de satisfaire à la fois les joueurs de Alerte rouge et leurs propres intentions car tous imaginaient des améliorations possibles très différentes. Le projet se serait vite transformé en échec car l'exploration de chaque idée aurait pris trop de temps et transformé trop profondément l'esprit du jeu. Ainsi, certaines améliorations, déjà prêtes et fonctionnelles, ont été supprimées car elle ne correspondaient pas avec le reste : c'est le cas par exemple d'un système qui aurait permis de choisir, avant le début d'une mission, les unités qui seront larguées pour la bataille (un peu comme dans Warzone 2100).
L'équilibrage des deux camps n'a pris que trois mois, ce qui est peu en comparaison des six mois qu'il a fallu pour C&C et des quatre de Alerte rouge. Les développeurs ont utilisé deux approches ; tout d'abord une approche « scientifique » : « si l'on fait s'affronter 1000 $ d'unités des deux camps, les dommages causés doivent être équivalents » ; puis une plus « artistique », en jouant, modifiant légèrement un ou deux paramètres et rejouant inlassablement des centaines de parties.
Alors que les premières versions étaient fonctionnelles, il apparut que certaines missions n'étaient pas suffisamment explicites dans leur déroulement. Certains messages donnant des indications pendant une mission devaient être doublés à l'origine, mais la planification n'a pas permis de nouvelles sessions d'enregistrements, ni de revoir le design de ces missions. Le jeu aura finalement neuf mois de retard sur le planning. Brett Sperry (game designer et fondateur de Westwood Studios) a d'ailleurs une manière toute à lui d'estimer les dates de sortie : « Quand vous ajoutez une nouvelle technologie fondamentale à un projet, il faut décaler la sortie estimée de 90 jours. Quand vous en ajoutez deux, il faut compter un an et pour trois ou plus, on ne peut pas prévoir de date de sortie. ». Soleil de Tiberium inclut trois nouvelles technologies :
le passage du moteur en 2D à une pseudo-3D. Cela rendit plus complexe à développer la destruction des ponts, la recherche de chemin, l'IA, le Z-buffering, le comportement des unités ;
le moteur de script a été très amélioré pour permettre de libérer l'imagination des game designers, mais entraînant par là de longues séances de débuggage ;
l'IA et le comportement des unités a été complètement revu.


=== Les missions ===
La création des missions suit un processus très strict qui s'améliore à chaque jeu :
tout commence par une proposition de mission de deux à trois pages : elle inclut le nom de la mission, le camp, la difficulté, la taille de la carte, le type de mission et d'autres détails techniques ; le briefing doit aussi y figurer avec une description de ce que devra être la vidéo d'introduction. Elle précise les informations dont le joueur devra avoir connaissance. Les objectifs de missions sont listés dans leur ordre d'apparition ainsi que les moyens pour les réaliser. Les conditions de victoire et de défaite sont ensuite créées avec la description des vidéos correspondantes. Enfin, sont précisés les messages audios et visuels ;
la proposition est soumise au lead designer (Adam Isgreen) et au producteur (Rade Stojsavljevic) ;
une fois validée, le designer fait d'abord une esquisse de la map sur papier, permettant ainsi d'avoir un point de vue global de la carte. Il modélise alors le terrain puis y ajoute les bâtiments, les routes et les arbres ;
on ajoute les scripts, ce qui prend environ les deux tiers du temps passé à faire la mission.
L'enchaînement des missions a été pensé pour ne pas être répétitif, en mélangeant des missions où l'on doit construire une base, et d'autres où l'on a qu'un nombre limité d'unités. Plusieurs missions comportent des objectifs annexes permettant aux designers de faire varier la difficulté de jeu. L'éditeur de mission utilisé en interne est directement relié au jeu et permet de tester les missions pendant leur création et de déceler les bugs plus rapidement.


=== Les séquences vidéos ===
Westwood Studios possédait son propre studio de tournage — avec un grand écran bleu — et sa propre maison de post-production. Toutes les séquences (avec de vrais acteurs ou générées par ordinateur) sont écrites sous forme de storyboard puis construites. Il a fallu trois mois aux six artistes 3D pour finaliser les décors.
Des problèmes de planification sont apparus pendant la phase de préproduction qui était déjà trop courte. Cependant les délais devaient être tenus car les deux acteurs principaux James Earl Jones et Michael Biehn n'auraient pas été disponibles à une autre date. Le temps alloué pour le tournage de certaines séquences complexes n'a pas été suffisant, obligeant à adapter sur le moment ou à corriger en post-production ; et « ce qui n'est pas planifié et corrigé en post-production prend dix fois plus de temps de d'argent ».
Des problèmes de volume et de transfert des vidéos sont apparus pendant la phase de post-production, mettant à mal le réseau. Les séquences à traiter sur PC étaient numérisées par un système de chez Avid, celles devant passer par une station Silicon Graphics étaient numériséés par un lecteur de bande intégré ; le tout était envoyé sur quatre serveurs, nécessitant plus de 500 Go d'espace disque.
Les vidéos sont maintenant en pleine résolution (en non plus une ligne sur deux comme sur les titres précédents), sur 24-bits de couleurs et en quinze images par seconde surpassant celles de Alerte rouge, Dune 2000 et de Alerte rouge : Retaliation.
Les séquences vidéos ont été réalisées par Joseph D. Kucan, qui interprète également le rôle de Kane, le leader du Nod.


=== Le matériel utilisé ===
Des ordinateurs Pentium Pro et Pentium II, de 200 à 450 MHz double processeurs avec 128 ou 256 Mo de RAM équipés de cartes son Creative Labs tournant sous Windows 95, 98 ou NT. Il a aussi fallu des stations de travail SGI 02 équipées de cartes accélératrices BlueICE.


==== Les logiciels utilisés ====
Microsoft Visual C++, Lightwave, 3D Studio Max, Discreet Flint, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Avid Media Composer, FileMaker Pro, Deluxe Paint.


=== Les innovations ===
Le relief et l'éclairage changent en fonction de la nuit ou du jour, mais le jeu reste en 3D isométrique (moteur utilisant des voxels).
Le jeu présente aussi un système de briefing où le joueur est totalement absent.
La barre latérale, présente depuis le premier C&C et même Dune 2, a été améliorée par l'ajout d'une file d'attente de production de cinq places par usine, de points de contrôle (waypoints) et la gestion de la consommation d'énergie.
Les armes lourdes peuvent modifier la structure du terrain en creusant des cratères ; c'est ce que le producteur Rade Stojsavljevic appelle « un champ de bataille dynamique » où « le joueur altère l'environnement ». Ce concept de bataille dynamique n'a selon lui pas été assez exploité ; par exemple, un joueur aurait pu mettre le feu à une forêt pour passer au travers, mais cela posait des problèmes de path-finding.


== Unités ==


=== Global Defense Initiative (G.D.I.) ===
Infanterie
Infanterie légère : c'est l'unité de base. Elle est armée d'un fusil d'assaut et possède un équipement de protection contre les balles de faible calibre et les éclats. Elle est donc capable de venir à bout des autres unités d'infanterie et des véhicules blindés ne disposant pas d'armements anti-personnel efficace. En revanche, cette unité est vulnérable aux balles des mitrailleuses lourdes, au laser et très vulnérable, aux obus d'artillerie et aux flammes ;
Discobole : unité d'infanterie moyenne armé de grenades aérodynamiques en forme de disque. Cette unité possède une puissance de feu capable d'infliger des dégâts sévères à tout type d'infanterie voire aux cyborgs du NOD. Elle dispose aussi d'une assez bonne capacité anti-char en étant en mesure d'infliger des dégâts moyens à tout type de véhicules (notamment ceux dépourvus d'armement anti-personnel). En revanche, elle est assez lente et moins protégée que l'Infanterie légère. Logiquement, elle est donc sensible aux mêmes menaces ; mitrailleuse lourde, laser, flammes et obus explosifs ;
Infanterie volante : unité d'infanterie lourde aéroportée équipée d'une mitrailleuse lourde. Équipée d'un réacteur individuel, elle peut voler au-dessus de tout type de terrain et son armement est efficace contre tout type d'infanterie et contre les véhicules légèrement blindés. Sa lenteur la rend extrêmement sensible aux défenses sol-air dans les airs et ses faibles équipements de protection en font une cible aisée au sol ;
Ingénieur : unité lente et peu protégée capable de s'emparer d'un bâtiment ennemi et de réparer un pont ou un bâtiment ;

Véhicules :
Lycaon : véhicule bipède léger de 2,5 mètres de haut et armé de deux canons mitrailleurs. Son armement est donc principalement orienté dans la lutte anti-personnel où il excelle mais il est aussi efficace contre les véhicules légers. En revanche, son faible blindage ne le protège que très mal des obus d'artillerie et des munitions anti-char ;
Titan : véhicule bipède lourd de 7,5 mètres de haut armé d'un canon de 120 mm, le Titan est le blindé de combat principal du G.D.I. grâce à son très puissant blindage qui lui fournit une bonne résistance aux projectiles anti-char ou aux lasers les plus puissants et une excellente protection contre les balles. En effet, son canon de 120 mm, alliant puissance et longue portée, lui permet d'infliger de gros dégâts aux blindés et aux structures adverses tandis que sa masse l'autorise à écraser l'infanterie. Cependant, ce véhicule demeure vulnérable aux attaques aériennes ou à longue portée du fait de sa lenteur ;
Aéroglisseur MLRS : véhicule amphibie armé d'un lance-roquette multiple capable d'attaquer des cibles terrestres ou aériennes à longue distance. Ses projectiles sont efficaces contre les véhicules, les aéronefs et les bâtiments. En revanche, l'infanterie y résiste assez bien. De plus, son blindage est trop léger pour le protéger des armes anti-char, des obus d'artillerie et des lasers les plus puissants ;
VBT amphibie : véhicule amphibie et assez rapide capble de transporter 5 unités d'infanterie. Il dispose d'un blindage épais lui assurant une bonne protection contre les armes légères et les projectiles anti-char ;
Désintégrateur : véhicule doté d'un armement dernier cri reposant sur les vibrations du son. Il est efficace à la fois contre l'infanterie et les véhicules et capables de toucher plusieurs cibles en même temps. Il est également fortement blindé et capable d'écraser l'infanterie ;
Mammouth Mk. II : véhicule expérimental qui ne peut être déployé qu'en un seul exemplaire. Il dispose d'un blindage particulièrement efficace contre tous les types de menaces. Son armement principal est un laser performant contre l'infanterie, les véhicules et les bâtiments. Il dispose aussi, comme armement secondaire, d'un lance-missile sol-air. Cependant, ses missiles disposent d'une puissance de feu et d'une portée trop faibles pour réellement inquiéter les aéronefs blindés ou rapides ;

Aéronefs :
Chasseur ORCA : chasseur d'attaque au sol léger et très rapide. Il embarque des munitions anti-char peu efficace contre l'infanterie mais capable de causer des dégâts sérieux aux véhicules et aux structures. Il est en revanche sensible aux missiles sol-air à cause de son faible blindage ;
Bombardier ORCA : bombardier lourd, lent mais fortement protégé par un blindage épais. Il assure des missions d'attaque au sol et peut frapper des regroupements d'unités. Ses bombes hautement explosives sont en effet efficaces contre l'infanterie, les véhicules ou les bâtiments. Cet aéronef possède aussi la capacité de survivre à de nombreux tirs d'armes anti-aériennes ;
Transporteur ORCA : unité aérienne moyennement blindée capable de saisir une unité terrestre et de la transporter dans les airs ;
Cargo ORCA : unité non disponible pour le joueur mais visible dans la campagne. C'est une unité lourde et très protégé qui peut transporter les unités blindées les plus lourdes du G.D.I. en grand nombre ;
Transport ORCA : unité non disponible pour le joueur mais visible dans la campagne. C'est un aéronef de transport léger destiné à l'infanterie.


=== Confrérie de NOD ===
Infanterie :
Infanterie légère : voir unité G.D.I. du même nom ;
Infanterie lance-roquette : unité d'infanterie moyenne armée d'un lance-roquette. Cette arme permet de toucher des cibles terrestres ou aériennes. Elle est très efficace contre l'infanterie et donne ses meilleurs résultats contre les véhicules et les aéronefs légers. Peu protégée, l'Infanterie lance-roquette est vulnérable aux balles, aux obus explosifs, aux flammes et aux lasers ;
Ingénieur : voir unité G.D.I. du même nom ;
Cyborg : unité d'infanterie lourde issu de la fusion d'un homme et d'un robot. Elle est ainsi capable de résister aux tirs de mitrailleuses mais est devenue la cible des armes anti-char. Elle est capable d'infliger de lourds dégâts à toutes les unités d'infanterie et demeure dangereuse contre les véhicules légers. Elle se régénère dans le tiberium ;
Commando cyborg : unité cyborg d'élite sélectionnée parmi les meilleures unités d'infanterie cyborg. Son armement est modifié et la mitrailleuse lourde est remplacée par un lance-plasma capable de percer tous les types de blindage en quelques coups. Ses protections sont aussi augmentées pour lui assurer un important taux de survie contre tous les types de projectiles. Il se régénère dans le tiberium mais ne peut être construit qu'en un seul exemplaire ;

Véhicules :
Jeep tout-terrain : la Jeep tout-terrain est un véhicule rapide armé d'une mitrailleuse lourde qui lui confère la même puissance de feu que le Lycaon pour une vitesse supérieure et un blindage identique. De manière également similaire, ce véhicule est vulnérable aux mêmes armes que le lycaon : munition anti-char, obus explosifs et laser ;
Moto d'attaque : unité terrestre la plus rapide du jeu, la Moto d'attaque est une unité de reconnaissance armée de roquettes anti-char efficaces contre les véhicules légers. Son faible blindage la rend cependant très vulnérable aux obus de gros calibre. Les armes anti-char et l'infanterie peuvent aussi lui infliger de sérieux dégâts ;
Tank Scarabée : char de combat principal du NOD, ce blindé léger est armé d'un canon anti-char de faible calibre à cadence de tirs assez élevée. Ainsi, il souffre d'un manque de puissance de feu contre l'infanterie (même s'il peut l'écraser) et est surtout efficace contre les véhicules légers. De plus, son blindage léger le rend sensible aux tirs d'armes lourdes ou spécialement destinées aux véhicules. Pour pallier cette faiblesse, le Tank Scarabée peut creuser le sol pour partiellement s'enterrer et ainsi améliorer ses défenses ;
Tank furtif : blindé léger capable de se rendre invisible (sauf à l'infanterie et aux défenses des bases). Il est armé d'un lance-roquette multiple sol-air et sol-sol qui lui permet d'infliger des dégâts moyens aux véhicules légers et même à l'infanterie. Comme pour les autres unités du NOD, son blindage léger en fait une bonne cible pour les armes anti-char, les obus explosifs et les lasers puissants ;
Tank Langue-de-diable : char fouisseur équipé de lance-flammes et d'un dispositif lui permettant de creuser sous terre pour se déplacer. Ce mode de déplacement lui permet de surgir dans les bases ennemies sans pouvoir être attaqué avant sa remontée. Son lance-flamme est redoutable contre l'infanterie, les bâtiments voire les véhicules légers. En revanche, les armes lourdes ont facilement raison de ce blindé faiblement protégé ;
Artillerie mobile : canon monté sur un plate-forme mobile relativement rapide. Il tire des obus explosifs de gros calibre pouvant infliger de sévères dégâts à toutes les unités à très longue distance. Cette unité est aussi capable de creuser le sol par ses tirs ;
Dépanneuse : unité légère capable de réparer les unités mécaniques endommagées ;

Aéronefs :
Frelon : hélicoptère équipé d'un canon mitrailleur. Il est efficace contre l'infanterie et les véhicules légers. Il est aussi doté d'un blindage assez résistant pour survivre à plusieurs tirs de missiles sol-air ;
Banshee : bombardier léger et rapide armé d'un lance-plasma. Il peut ainsi infliger de lourds dégâts à toute unité et rapidement s'éloigner de la zone de sa frappe. En revanche, sa faible protection supporte assez mal les tirs d'armes anti-aériennes même si sa vitesse lui permet d'être exposé peu de temps.


=== Mutants ===
Infanterie : les unités mutantes utilisent principalement de l'infanterie peu armée (fusil et parfois fusil d'assaut ou lance-roquette) et peu protégée et donc vulnérable à toutes les armes existantes. Cependant, les Mutants disposent aussi d'unités plus sophistiquées et beaucoup mieux armées :
Infanterie type Umagaan : unité d'infanterie utilisant le même armement que l'unité Umagaan. Elle est capable d'éliminer n'importe quelle unité d'infanterie en un seul coup mais est totalement inefficace contre les véhicules ;
Chasseur fantôme : unité d'infanterie d'élite équipé d'un fusil à rayon laser redoutable contre l'infanterie aussi bien que contre les véhicules. En outre, le Chasseur fantôme dispose de charges de C4 qui peuvent détruire tous les bâtiments ;
Voleur mutant : unité peu protégée mais très rapide capable de voler toutes les unités mécaniques et de les conduire. Quand le véhicule est détruit, le Voleur mutant survit et peut s'en prendre à une autre unité ;
Ennemis tibériens : des affinités existent parfois entre les Mutants et ces étranges créatures qui peuplent les champs de tiberium. Quoi qu'il en soit, les ennemis tibériens sont redoutables contre l'infanterie et efficace et les véhicules légers. De plus, ils se régénèrent très rapidement dans le tiberium ;
Infanterie légère : dans la mission du NOD où se déroule l'attaque de la grande base mutante, ce sont des unités identiques à celles du G.D.I. ;

Véhicules : comme pour leur infanterie, les Mutants utilisent des moyens de récupération pour se fabriquer des véhicules militaires. Ainsi, des bus, des camions ou des voitures peuvent être équipés de roquettes anti-char ou de canons similaires à ceux de la Moto d'Attaque ou du Tank Scarabée du NOD. Cela les rend dangereux au moins pour les véhicules légers. Selon la qualité du blindage adoptée, ces unités sont plus ou moins résistantes. Quelques véhicules plus spécifiques sont aussi utilisés par les Mutants :
Jeep tout-terrain : dans la mission du NOD où se déroule l'attaque de la grande base mutante, ce sont des unités identiques à celles du NOD ;
Tank Mammouth : vieille unité du G.D.I. remise en état par les Mutants. Souffrant d'une certaine lenteur, ce char lourd compense par un blindage très performant, une très bonne puissance de feu basée sur son double canon et par une capacité longue-portée et anti-aérienne fondée sur ses roquettes sol-air et sol-sol. De plus, le Tank Mammouth dispose d'une capacité d'auto-réparation ;

Aéronefs :
Frelon : dans la mission du NOD où se déroule l'attaque de la grande base mutante, ce sont des unités identiques à celles du NOD.

585,"La chronologie du bassin minier du Nord-Pas-de-Calais au XIXe siècle est marquée par la première période de cherté des houilles, liée à la réussite de la Compagnie des mines de Douchy dans les années 1830 et à la révolution industrielle ; ces recherches ont amené un grand nombre de sociétés à se constituer, d'où les découvertes des prolongements du bassin minier du Nord vers le Pas-de-Calais, suite de la révolution industrielle. Cette période des années 1850 et du début des années 1860 a vu un grand nombre de sociétés s'installer, prospérer, et obtenir une concession. Enfin, les années 1870 sont marquées par la deuxième période de cherté des houilles.

588,"Jules Michelin, né le 31 octobre 1817 à Paris, et mort le 14 juin 1870 à Limoges, est un peintre, dessinateur et graveur français, réputé pour ses eaux-fortes et ses lithographies.
Il est l'ancêtre de la famille d'industriels, les Michelin.


== Biographie ==

Jules Michelin exerce au départ la profession de receveur des Douanes.
En 1840, il veut devenir lithographe, s'exerçant à cet art auprès de deux artistes, Camille Roqueplan et Charles Ramelet (1805-1851).
Il expose au Salon à partir de 1844, surtout des pastels et des dessins. Il publie dans L'Artiste en 1846.
Michelin épouse Adèle Barbier (née en 1829), héritière d’une fabrique de caoutchouc : leurs deux enfants sont André (né en 1853), et Édouard Michelin (1859-1940), fondateurs d'une lignée d'industriels.
Il abandonne la pierre lithographique pour se consacrer uniquement à la technique de l'eau-forte en 1852.
En 1862, il rejoint la Société des aquafortistes animée par Auguste Delâtre et Alfred Cadart. En 1863, chez Cadart et F. Chevalier, il publie une série de douze planches gravées représentant différents paysages de la France. En 1868, Philippe Burty lui commande une eau-forte pour illustrer un poème d'André Theuriet, dans le recueil Sonnets et eaux-fortes. Il participe également à l'illustration du Musée universel d’Édouard Lièvre édité par Goupil et Cie.
Attaché, comme ses contemporains, au travail sur le motif, Jules Michelin a parcouru toute la France. Il s’est aussi rendu à Rome et en Angleterre, où la gravure à l’eau-forte était revitalisée par Alphonse Legros. Deux régions françaises avaient toutefois sa préférence : le cœur du Massif central — tant l’Auvergne que le Limousin, dont il appréciait les paysages vigoureux — et l’Île de France.
En 1869, il rejoint à Limoges son ami Adrien Dubouché, qu’il aide à ordonnancer le catalogue du musée municipal, devenu aujourd’hui Musée national Adrien Dubouché C’est dans cette ville qu’il meurt prématurément, le 14 juin 1870, peut-être du choléra.
Il fut le graveur attitré de Camille Corot.
Le catalogue raisonné de l’œuvre de Jules Michelin établi par Pierre Sanchez recense une petite soixantaine de lithographies et eaux-fortes conservées dans les collections du marchand Paul Prouté, dans les fonds d’institutions comme la New York Public Library, le musée national Adrien Dubouché de Limoges, le musée des arts décoratifs de Paris et le département des estampes et de la photographie de la Bibliothèque nationale de France.

589,"Le phare de Dofflemyer Point est un phare situé à Boston Harbor au nord d'Olympia sur le Puget Sound (Comté de Thurston), dans l'État de Washington aux États-Unis.
Ce phare est géré par la Garde côtière américaine, et les phares de l'État de Washington sont entretenues par le District 13 de la Garde côtière  basé à Seattle.
Il est inscrit au National Register of Historic Places depuis le 16 février 1989 .


== Histoire ==
Dofflemyer Point définit le côté est de l'entrée de Budd Inlet (en), le bras le plus au sud qui mène à Olympia, la capitale de l'État. Une lanterne avec lentille, au sommet d'un pieu de 3,6 m y avait été établie en 1887.


== Description ==
Le phare actuel a été construit en 1934. C'est une tour pyramidale en béton de 9 m de haut, avec galerie et sans lanterne.
Il a été partiellement automatisé dans les années 1960 avec l'utilisation de cellules photovoltaïques. Cependant un gardien était toujours nécessaire pour la maintenance de la tour et pour actionner le signal de brouillard quand c'était nécessaire. Le phare a été totalement automatisé en 1987 et un radiophare a été installé.
Il émet, à une hauteur focale de 9 m, un long éclat blanc toutes les 6 secondes. Sa portée est de 7 milles nautiques (environ 13 km). Sa corne de brume est toujours en activité.
Le phare est sur une propriété privé.

590,"Le putsch de Kapp est une tentative de putsch réalisée entre le 13 mars et le 17 mars 1920 par une brigade commandée par le général von Lüttwitz en soutien à Wolfgang Kapp (1858–1922), fondateur en 1917 du Parti allemand de la patrie avec Alfred von Tirpitz, et le général Walther von Lüttwitz. Il s’inscrit dans la longue série de troubles intérieurs que connaît la République de Weimar jusqu’en 1924.


== Historique ==

En 1919, un Corps franc, la « brigade Ehrhardt », est créé. Mais, anti-républicain, il représente une menace pour la république de Weimar. Les Alliés exigent sa dissolution, acceptée par le gouvernement du Reich.
Le 13 mars 1920, une brigade de 6 000 hommes fondée par le capitaine Ehrhardt et commandée par le général von Lüttwitz marche sur Berlin, afin de soutenir Kapp pour contraindre le gouvernement à revenir sur sa décision. L’armée refuse de tirer sur les insurgés (« La Reichswehr ne tire pas sur la Reichswehr »). Le gouvernement légal se voit dans l'obligation de fuir la capitale et de se replier à Stuttgart.

Kapp forme alors un nouveau gouvernement provisoire. Mais il est confronté à une grève générale de quatre jours déclenchée par les syndicats et les partis de gauche (parti communiste, parti socialiste et parti social-démocrate), qui bloque toute l’économie, et à la résistance des fonctionnaires berlinois. De plus, la Reichsbank refuse de financer davantage ses troupes. Des manifestations et des troubles éclatent dans toute l'Allemagne, notamment dans la Ruhr.
Le 17 mars, Kapp est contraint de fuir vers la Suède, mais revient néanmoins en Allemagne, où il est arrêté. Il décédera en 1922, avant son procès.

=== Le scénario : du documentaire à la fiction ===
Le scénario d‘Hiroshima mon amour est d'abord censé naître de Françoise Sagan, auteur au succès fulgurant à la fin des années 1950. Le producteur Antoine Dauman envisage en 1958 de lui confier l'écriture d'une fiction sur la bombe atomique mais échoue à plusieurs reprises à lui en parler : l'écrivain oublie une première fois, puis lors d'une seconde occasion, de se rendre au rendez-vous parisien qui a été fixé avec le producteur et Alain Resnais, dont la carrière vient d'être lancée par Nuit et Brouillard et qui est pressenti pour la réalisation. Simone de Beauvoir est un temps envisagée mais, sur la suggestion de Resnais, c'est vers Marguerite Duras que la production se tourne ensuite. Resnais apprécie son œuvre théâtrale et a autrefois songé à adapter Moderato cantabile au grand écran.
Alain Resnais apparaît alors comme la « nouvelle conscience du cinéma français » et ses producteurs voudraient le voir enchaîner, après des documentaires sur Guernica et sur les camps d'extermination nazis, avec une enquête sur les bombardements des villes japonaises. Un titre est même déjà avancé : « Pikadon », transcription du nom japonais de l'éclair atomique. Le réalisateur voit cependant le projet autrement : depuis des mois qu'il étudie la chose sous tous les angles, notamment avec l'aide de Chris Marker et en visionnant nombre d'archives, il considère qu'un tel documentaire n'aurait rien d'inédit. Et de proposer à Duras « une histoire d'amour d'où l'angoisse atomique ne serait pas absente ». « Je lui ai parlé de cette notion de personnages qui ne seraient pas des héros, qui ne participeraient pas à l'action mais en seraient des témoins, ce que nous sommes dans la majorité des cas devant les catastrophes : des spectateurs », se souvient-il.
Confrontée à la sortie du film à des critiques sur son contenu, Marguerite Duras le reprécise dans une lettre ouverte : « Nous n'avons eu, en faisant ce film, aucun objectif patriotique ou antipatriotique. Nous avons voulu faire un film sur l'amour. Nous avons voulu peindre les pires conditions de l'amour, les conditions les plus communément blâmées, les plus répréhensibles, les plus inadmissibles. Un même aveuglement règne du fait de la guerre sur Nevers et sur Hiroshima. » Un même aveuglement, dont l'on retrouve une trace dans l'un des titres initialement envisagés pour le film : Tu n'as rien vu.
« Faites de la littérature. Oubliez la caméra », enjoint donc le réalisateur à sa scénariste, à qui il rend régulièrement visite pour « voir » ce qu'elle met au jour, tout comme les personnages du futur film se partageront leurs visions. Il lui demande également des biographies fournies de chaque personnage, dont seuls quelques minces éléments seront énoncés dans le film : « Resnais voulait, en ne montrant qu'un aspect parmi les cent aspects d'une même chose, être conscient de sa « faillite » de ne pouvoir en montrer qu'une parmi cent », témoigne l'auteur. C'est ainsi que les personnages ne portent pas de nom, dans une vision égalitaire de ce monde d'après la bombe. Leurs échanges se poursuivront par voie épistolaire une fois Resnais rendu au Japon pour les repérages.


=== Le script ===
Il s'agit de la première collaboration entre Alain Resnais et la scripte Sylvette Baudrot avec qui il travaillera sur de nombreux films. Il a déclaré à ce propos « Sans Sylvette Baudrot, je ne sais pas ce qui me serait arrivé. » En effet, le film se tournant au Japon, elle se charge des contacts humains avec les Japonais sans même parler leur langue, et, grâce à son expérience, elle permet au réalisateur, dont c'est le deuxième long métrage, d'éviter de nombreuses complications sur le tournage. Alain Resnais avait par exemple écrit une scène où un chien dans une rue d'Hiroshima sautait dans la péniche du restaurant et, suivi par la caméra, la faisait entrer dans la salle. Sylvette Baudrot a fait remarquer au réalisateur qu'il faudrait alors emmener le même chien d'Hiroshima où était tournée la scène de la rue, à Tokyo où serait filmé l'intérieur du restaurant, ce qui a incité Resnais à abandonner cette idée.


=== Tournage ===

Le tournage se fait dans un très court laps de temps : deux semaines au Japon suffiront en août 1958. Dans un premier temps, Resnais visite la ville et continue d'échanger avec Duras restée en France : il lui envoie des lettres accompagnées des photos prises sur place tandis qu'elle lui répond par des enregistrements sonores dans lesquels elle propose de nouvelles répliques. En attendant l'arrivée de l'interprète principale, Emmanuelle Riva, Resnais use d'une marionnette en bois qu'il conduit au son des bandes que lui a envoyées Duras.

=== Accueil critique ===
Hiroshima mon amour est considéré par la majorité des critiques comme un chef-d’œuvre. Il bénéficie par exemple de 95 % de critiques positives sur Rotten Tomatoes et d'une note de 8,0/10 sur IMDb. Les critiques évoquent en effet l' « écriture éclatée et les dialogues incantatoires [qui] ouvraient des voies nouvelles au langage cinématographique » et parlent d'un texte qui est « resté célèbre pour sa musique, pour le balancement des contraires. » Les Cahiers du cinéma soulignent quant à eux la modernité du film qui a « bouleversé l'histoire du cinéma », tout comme Le Figaroscope qui y voit « un chef d'œuvre envoûtant du 7e art ».
Jean-Luc Godard a déclaré avoir été jaloux du film : « Je me souviens avoir été très jaloux de Hiroshima mon amour. Je me disais : ""ça c'est bien et ça nous a échappé, on n'a pas de contrôle là dessus."" ».
Pour Claude Chabrol, Hiroshima mon amour est le « plus beau film qu['il ait] vu depuis 500 ans. »
Avec le recul historique, Jean-Michel Frodon, dans sa somme sur le cinéma français, le qualifie de « film véritablement exceptionnel ».
Michel Ciment cite le film dans sa « cinémathèque imaginaire » : « Avec Hiroshima, mon amour, j'ai eu la sensation de n'avoir jamais vu cela au cinéma, j'en tremblais. Resnais a fait avec ce film un peu comme Picasso avec Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Il y avait là un objet cinématographique qui rendait tout le reste classique. Il y avait une réelle nouveauté qui m'avait à l'époque complètement électrisé. Cette réflexion sur l'histoire, le fait de mêler l'intime, qui d'ailleurs à l'époque avait beaucoup choqué, l'individuel au collectif, l'histoire et le destin individuel, dans un style absolument soufflant de fluidité m'a complètement bouleversé. J'ai eu l'impression qu'on ne faisait plus du cinéma de la même façon. ».
Toutefois, le critique Michel Mourlet, trouve le film « ennuyeux, nul et laid ». À propos d'Hiroshima mon amour et L'année dernière à Marienbad, il écrit : « Aucune connaissance de l'acteur, aucun empire sur le décor, les éléments, aucun sens du récit, rien que de pauvres petits essais d'intellectuels qui jouent gravement à faire du cinéma ».


=== Accueil public ===
Le film a totalisé 255 000 entrées en salles en France.


== Analyse ==

À la fois poème d'amour et de mort, évocation de la première bombe atomique lancée sur la ville, et appel à la réconciliation entre les peuples.
Ce film, comme Nuit et Brouillard, participe du devoir de mémoire et rappelle, même si cela peut paraître dérisoire par rapport aux souffrances des blessés d'Hiroshima, l'injustice qui a frappé, à la libération de Nevers, le soldat allemand, tué, et la Française, tondue, pour avoir été coupables d'amour.
Ce film, en plus d'être un travail sur la mémoire, rappelle l'impossibilité de parler d'Hiroshima en soulignant l'écart entre représentation et réalité non-totalisable. Ce film souligne également l'écart entre l'Histoire (la bombe atomique, l'Occupation et la Libération) et l'histoire (deux amants à Hiroshima, deux amants à Nevers).
Le film s'inscrit dans la réflexion obsessionnelle menée par l'auteur sur la mémoire, tant collective qu'individuelle, et sa forme cinématographique. Il l'avait entamée avant Hiroshima, notamment avec les deux documentaires Nuit et Brouillard et Les statues meurent aussi (coréalisé avec Chris Marker), et il la poursuivra avec les deux prochains longs-métrages : L'Année dernière à Marienbad, coécrit cette fois avec Alain Robbe-Grillet, et Muriel ou le Temps d'un retour, mêlant aussi la géographie d'une ville au souvenir d'un grand traumatisme historique (la Guerre d'Algérie, tout juste achevée alors), coécrit avec Jean Cayrol.
Dans Table ronde sur Hiroshima, les critiques des Cahiers du cinéma soulignent le fait que ce film n'a jamais eu aucun précédent dans l'histoire du cinéma et sa parenté avec la modernité dans d'autres arts (cubisme, Stravinski, nouveau roman).
Alain Resnais et Marguerite Duras n'étant pas d'accord sur la fin du film (à savoir si elle allait rester ou non à Hiroshima), ils ont décidé de la laisser ouverte.


== Le style d'Hiroshima mon amour ==
Alain Resnais et Marguerite Duras placent la mémoire au centre de leurs œuvres respectives, à l'instar du film Nuit et Brouillard ou du roman Un Barrage contre le Pacifique, qui précèdent la sortie d'Hiroshima mon amour. L'étude suivante propose une analyse conjointe du scénario de Marguerite Duras et du film d'Alain Resnais, puisque l'œuvre littéraire en tant que scénario publié, n'est pas séparable du long-métrage.


=== Repenser l'antithèse ===
Hiroshima mon amour est une œuvre où l'antithèse est présente dès le titre. Hiroshima est juxtaposée au vocatif amoureux : mon amour. Dans le souci de montrer l’universalité de l’humanité, les oppositions permettent à Resnais et Duras de pointer les différences mais surtout la continuité qui les unit. Quatre oppositions majeures sont présentes dans le film : la fiction et le document historique, l’Orient et l’Occident, l’amour et la mort, le silence et la parole.
Nevers, se rapprochant de l’adverbe anglais never, et Hiroshima, proche de l’ire et de l’éros jouent sur une onomastique antithétique : l’absence face à l’excès. Comme le motif du fleuve, le travelling identique effectué dans les deux villes les place dans un rapport d’égalité alors que les différentes focales utilisées les séparent. Une focale courte est utilisée pour Hiroshima et une focale longue pour Nevers. La focale longue apporte une distance à l’image et place celle-ci dans un temps plus éloigné où les mouvements sont ralentis. Les deux endroits s’opposent par ces moyens techniques qui concourent également à opposer deux temporalités inhérentes aux deux villes. L’amour et la mort s’opposent et insèrent dans le film une dimension lyrique. La Française peut être assimilée à une figure de morte amoureuse. La fameuse réplique « Tu me tues. Tu me fais du bien » agglomère les notions d’amour pouvant être la cause d’un « bien » et de mort. Cette tension entre amour et mort collabore au lyrisme de Hiroshima mon amour et est un leitmotiv de l’œuvre de Marguerite Duras. L’amour est voué à l’échec comme dans L’Amant.
Une des manifestations antithétiques de Hiroshima mon amour est l’ambivalence entre silence et parole. Le discours est souvent emphatique et proche de l’incantation. Une des tirades de la Française est remarquable :

« Les femmes risquent d'accoucher d'enfants mal venus, de monstres, mais ça continue [...]. Une ville entière se met en colère. Des villes entières se mettent en colère. »

— (Marguerite Duras, Hiroshima mon amour, Folio, p.30-31)
L’emphase repose ici sur la gradation, les effets de répétitions et de dérivations. Face à l’emphase, les silences et les échanges brefs sont fréquents. Le point de suspension jalonne les dialogues et permet de faire jaillir la parole au milieu du silence, du rien mais aussi de l’indicible. L’œuvre se révèle fidèle à l’idée de double continuité évoquée par Resnais. Les éléments antithétiques et les tensions qui naissent de ces oppositions permettent de tendre vers l’universalité.


=== Le feuilletage temporel ===
Cette tension vers l'universel s'exprime aussi dans l’œuvre par le brouillage des frontières entre les trois temps du récit que sont le présent de l'intrigue principale entre la Française et le Japonais, le passé atomique et le passé plus lointain de la Française à Nevers. Dans le scénario on peut lire par exemple, hors du dialogue, dans les indications scénographiques de Duras :

« Banlieue. Rails. Banlieue. Banalité universelle. »

— (Marguerite Duras, Hiroshima mon amour, Folio, Gallimard, p.35.)
Pour exprimer cette ""banalité universelle"", Resnais choisit de mêler dans le film des images de la banlieue de Nevers avec celles de la banlieue d'Hiroshima. Cette superposition des lieux implique la superposition des temps ; le passé nivernais s'immisce dans le présent par des effets de montage qui vont faire se succéder sans transition deux plans appartenant à ces deux temps différents.
De la même manière, au début du film, une scène nous montre le Japonais allongé dans le lit, la caméra est centrée sur sa main lorsque apparaît brusquement à l'écran une autre main, ensanglantée, celle du soldat allemand (premier amour de la Française à Nevers), agonisant sur un quai de gare ? L'effet de brouillage est d'autant plus accentué que le spectateur, à ce moment du film, ne dispose pas encore des informations nécessaires pour identifier cet Allemand mourant qui apparaît pour la première fois. Le montage force donc la participation du spectateur qui devra, a posteriori, réorganiser le récit pour comprendre que ce qu'il prenait pour une superposition d'images sans logique apparente était une réminiscence de la Française qui, voyant la main de son amant japonais, se rappelle celle de son premier amour. Le feuilletage temporel invite donc à une réflexion sur l'amour et se retrouve au sein même du dialogue, dans les mots de Riva :

« ... Je te rencontre. Je me souviens de toi. Qui es-tu ? »

— (Marguerite Duras, Hiroshima mon amour, Folio, Gallimard, p.35)
Une fois de plus passé et présent sont mêlés par l'identification des figures de l'Allemand et du Japonais au sein du dialogue, dans une vision de l'amour héritière du Banquet de Platon : les histoires d'amour sont les mêmes et se répètent, l'on aime toujours la même personne bien que l'objet aimé, ici allemand ou japonais, puisse changer.


=== Le problème de la conversation ===
La conversation est l'un des médiums de la résurgence du souvenir dans Hiroshima mon amour. Il s'opère un paradoxe entre la forme résolument présente de la conversation et son thème tourné vers le passé.
Écrire un scénario de cinéma revient assez sommairement à rédiger une forme dialoguée qui imite une conversation, interaction verbale entre plusieurs personnages. L'originalité de l'écriture scénaristique de Marguerite Duras réside dans son refus de rendre plausible et réaliste la conversation qui anime le Japonais et la Française dans Hiroshima mon amour. La conversation mise en scène est si travaillée au niveau de la langue qu'elle relève d'un style trop littéraire et trop écrit pour se prêter au caractère naturel et imprévisible de l'oral lorsque l'on s'exprime. L'absence d'épanorthose lors des longues prises de parole des personnages, associée aux multiples figures de style présentes au sein parfois d'une même réplique, assez peu probable lorsqu'on parle avec vivacité et spontanéité, ainsi que la répétition du lieu d'énonciation « à Hiroshima » entre les personnages, surprennent le spectateur qui ne reconnaît pas le ton quotidien que prend une conversation traditionnelle au cinéma. Les voix récitatives des acteurs dans la mise en scène d'Alain Resnais ne font qu'accentuer le fait que le scénario de Marguerite Duras ne cherche pas à reproduire un échange conventionnel entre la Française et le Japonais.
Dans un dialogue fictionnel, comme dans une conversation réelle, les personnages sont supposés interagir l'un avec l'autre, chaque réplique est adressée par un émetteur pour un destinataire. Dans ce scénario, non seulement les répliques de l'homme et de la femme ne paraissent jamais vraiment se répondre par manque de cohérence et effet de décalage mais aussi les traces de la fonction phatique du langage brillent par leur absence, comme si les personnages ne s'appelaient jamais et étaient posés l'un en face de l'autre arbitrairement. Ils monologuent intérieurement chacun de leur côté plus qu'ils ne se parlent. De plus, l'homme et la femme n'ont pas d'idiolecte propre, ils s'expriment quasiment de la même manière en s'échangeant des tournures syntaxiques, parfois des phrases entières, l'un avec l'autre, souvent de façon suivie, comme s'ils lisaient un « texte parlé » qui ne leur appartenait pas. Or dans une conversation, chaque participant est censé être caractérisé par des faits de langue individuels.
Ces divers paradoxes entre la forme dialoguée du scénario, les attentes d'une conversation normale et le contenu réel du scénario de Marguerite Duras amènent nécessairement des flottements d'identification générique. Une des possibilités d'interprétation du scénario d'Hiroshima mon amour est d'en faire une lecture à haute voix d'un même texte que deux personnages se partagent. Face à un scénario littéraire, qui préfigure le mouvement de la Nouvelle Vague, la figure de style qu'est la métaphore s'impose à la fois dans l’œuvre de Duras et dans le film.


=== La métaphore au cœur d'un nouveau système de représentation ===
Au détriment du modèle du film politique et historique, Marguerite Duras et Alain Resnais vont construire « un film sur l'idée de la bombe, présente en arrière-fond, qui ne serait pas présente à l'écran ». Afin de faire renaître l'horreur et la violence, ils privilégient le recours à l'évocation en utilisant la figure de la métaphore. De même que la vie doit se reconstruire sur les ruines d'Hiroshima, le langage se reconstruit, par le biais de la métaphore, sur les ruines des anciens référents.
Paul Ricœur précise que « le pouvoir de la métaphore serait de briser une catégorisation antérieure, afin d'établir de nouvelles frontières logiques sur les ruines des précédentes» Le choix de placer le film dans la perspective d'une histoire d'amour est un premier indice de ce changement de référence pour parler de la bombe d'Hiroshima. Le scénario s'ouvre sur « deux épaules nues », « comme trempées de cendre, de pluie, de rosée ou de sueur, comme on veut ». Cette image, associée à celle du champignon de la bombe H de BIKINI, uniquement présente dans le scénario, devient métaphorique et rend visible toute la violence de la bombe atomique. Les corps en mouvement deviennent les comparants du champignon dans un système de métaphore filée qui active la fonction symbolique et évocatrice de la figure. A l'écran, ce sont les cinq plans de corps enlacés en fondu enchaîné qui s'assimilent à cette figure littéraire pour représenter la fission nucléaire. Le fondu mêle les premiers corps aux seconds afin qu'ils ne fassent plus qu'un, les corps des amants évoquant ainsi de façon symbolique les corps abîmés par la bombe.
Un jeu d'analogie de la métaphore se dévoile dont la construction repose majoritairement sur des effets de symétrie et de dissymétrie que l'on remarque avec la présence du chat blanc de la Place de la Paix à Hiroshima qui devient le double métaphorique du chat noir de la cave de Nevers, ou encore avec l'image de la pluie tombant le soir sur Hiroshima qui s'associe aux pluies de cendre et à la pluie le long des murs de la cave de Nevers. Ces jeux d'analogies poursuivent l'idée que l'histoire personnelle des deux amants devient une nouvelle référence symbolique pour parler de la guerre.
Parallèlement, il faut souligner le pouvoir imageant de la métaphore. Grâce à sa puissance poétique elle permet de représenter l'irreprésentable. En ce sens, la lumière aveuglante des « dix-mille soleils » activés « sur la place de la Paix » à Hiroshima est la métaphore de cette insuffisance des références communes de la langue à exprimer ce qui ne peut l'être et illustre la nécessité d'avoir recours au langage poétique pour représenter l’indicible.

=== Un groupe particulier : le plancton ===

Le plancton marin a ceci de particulier qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un groupe taxinomique ou phylogénétique, mais représente un regroupement d'organismes très disparates appartenant à de nombreux groupes (animaux, ou zooplancton, végétaux, ou phytoplancton, bactéries, ...) seulement définis par leur vie en milieu aquatique, leur incapacité à nager horizontalement contre les courants (ils se laissent ballotter au gré de ceux-ci mais peuvent effectuer des déplacements verticaux) et leur position à la base de chaînes alimentaires. Le plancton est à opposer au necton et au pleiston.

601,"Bubblegum Crisis (バブルガムクライシス, Baburugamu Kuraishisu) est une série télévisée d'animation japonaise Cyberpunk en huit épisodes, créée en 1987 par Anime International Company (AIC), ARTMIC Studios et Youmex et diffusée sous forme d'OAV entre le 25 février 1987 et le 30 novembre 1991.
Les six premiers épisodes ont été édités en VHS en France dans les années 1990 chez Kazé et la série est sortie en intégralité en DVD courant 2008 chez l'éditeur Black Bones puis réédité chez Manga Distribution.


== Synopsis ==
Dans un futur proche, Tokyo est dévastée par un terrible tremblement de terre. Sept ans plus tard, une nouvelle Cité, MegaTôkyô, est bâtie sur les ruines par le biais d’investissements privés d’une multinationale aussi prospère que secrète : GENOM. Cette dernière est responsable de la création et de la production de masse de puissantes créatures biomécaniques du nom de Boomers, destinées à servir le développement industriel de la ville naissante et étendre son emprise sur le monde entier. Mais les Boomers échappent rapidement à tout contrôle et l’AD Police est appelée à la rescousse. Le combat s’avère plus difficile que prévu. En 2032, quatre jeunes filles vêtues d’armures s’unissent alors clandestinement pour lutter contre cette nouvelle menace sous le nom de « Knight Sabers »…

602,"Le Musée d’art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul est un musée d’art contemporain situé dans le centre-ville de Baie-Saint-Paul, dans la région touristique de Tourisme dans Charlevoix au Québec. De plus, il est situé au cœur du quartier culturel. Son emplacement est reconnu comme étant un endroit où sont situés bon nombre de galeries et de monuments en l’honneur des artistes.


== Mission ==
La mission du Musée d’art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul est de faire connaître, promouvoir et conserver l’art contemporain à l’aide d’événements de conservation, d’acquisition et de démonstration de l’art tout en conservant la modernité. De plus, rapprocher l’art et le public est un autre aspect de leur mission. En effet, créer un accès facile et une relation directe avec les visiteurs qui viennent découvrir les arts de ce musée.


== Histoire ==
Le Musée d’art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul occupe l’ancien emplacement du cinéma le Laurentien. Après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, il est devenu un lieu de prédilection pour les spectacles régionaux ainsi que des troupes de théâtre itinérantes du Québec. Vers le milieu des années 1980, la corporation du centre lance une campagne de souscription populaire et à la suite de cela, un montant de 100 000 $ fut amassé. Cette somme servira à mettre en action un centre d’exposition d’importance nationale qui sera complètement consacrée aux activités artistiques et culturelles dans la région de Charlevoix. Avec la supervision, à l’époque, de madame Françoise Labbé, le bâtiment sera construit au même emplacement que le cinéma le Laurentien. Il est le seul musée d’art contemporain de l’est du Québec.


== Le bâtiment ==
Dessiné par l’architecte Pierre Thibault, le musée devient à lui seul un œuvre d’art.


== Guidage dans le musée ==
Lors des Symposiums, des entremetteurs guident les visiteurs. Selon le directeur du musée, tous les nouveaux dans un nouvel environnement ont besoin d’accompagnement et d’explications. Dans la partie de l’exposition permanente, les entremetteurs ont été remplacés par des textes et des vidéos qui projettent les personnages principaux de l’exposition de sorte que les visiteurs aient l’impression qu’ils leur parlent directement.


== Collection ==
Jusqu’à maintenant, le Musée a eu la chance d’accueillir de grandes expositions. Notamment, en 1998, la visite de Riopelle et son célèbre canot suspendu qui a attiré l’attention de beaucoup de visiteurs. Aussi, le Symposium international d’art contemporain a présenté une grande collection qui remémore la visite de 400 artistes du monde. De plus, de grands artistes ont exposé au Musée d’art contemporain, dont George D. Pepper, Kathleen Daly, René Richard, les sœurs Bolducs et plusieurs autres. Présentement, le musée dispose d’une exposition permanente qui se nomme «Zone de libres-échanges» qui racontent les différentes histoires de cet événement qui se déroule à l’année et où douze artistes œuvrent directement dans l’aréna municipale de Baie-Saint-Paul. Le public fait partie intégrante de cette création.


== La reconnaissance muséale ==
Le 13 juin 2008, madame Christine Saint-Pierre, ministre de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine au Québec, a accordé la reconnaissance muséale officielle du Musée d’art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul. Après avoir reçu le titre muséal, le musée ne s’en est pas tenu simplement à ça. Pour celui-ci, c’est une responsabilité très importante qui encourage les grands dirigeants et ses collaborateurs à conserver un niveau qui frôle l’excellence.


== Autres faits intéressants et expositions à venir ==
Le Musée d’art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul organisera du 28 novembre 2015 au 14 février 2016, l’exposition Ateliers croisés. Œuvres qui seront rassemblées par monsieur René Viau, commissaire de l’exposition, et Serge Murphy, chargé de projet. Cette exposition présentera des œuvres des artistes Claude Vermette (objets d’art, pièces de faïence, encres, aquarelles et céramiques) ainsi que Mariette Rousseau-Vermette (tapisserie) afin de présenter le parcours complet du couple originaire de Sainte-Adèle.

603,"Henri Tudor, titré duc de Cornouailles, (1er janvier – 23 février 1511) était le premier fils du roi d'Angleterre Henri VIII d'Angleterre et de sa première épouse Catherine d'Aragon.


== Biographie ==


=== Naissance et baptême ===
Henri est né le 1er janvier 1511 au Palais de Richmond, dix-huit mois après le mariage de ses parents, et était le premier fils du couple royal. Catherine avait déjà donné naissance à une fille qui n'avait pas survécu, le 31 janvier 1510. Il fut baptisé le 5 janvier lors d'une cérémonie fastueuse. Les cadeaux de baptême incluaient un détenteur de sel d'or fin et une coupe pesant un total de 3 kilogrammes, offerts par Louis XII de France, son parrain. Ses autres parrains ou marraines étaient William Warham, archevêque de Cantorbéry, et Marguerite d'Autriche. Au baptême, la grande-tante du bébé, Lady Anne Howard représenta par procuration Marguerite de Habsbourg, et Richard Foxe, évêque de Winchester fit de même pour le roi de France.


=== Célébrations et décès ===
Le roi Henri et son épouse avaient prévu d'extravagantes célébrations pour fêter la naissance de son fils, qui devint automatiquement Duc de Cornouailles et héritier apparent du trône d'Angleterre, et devait devenir Prince de Galles, Roi d'Angleterre, et troisième roi de la Maison Tudor. Le tournoi à Westminster fut le plus fastueux du règne d'Henri VIII. Le roi Henri emporta la faveur de la reine Catherine lors du tournoi, combattant sous la bannière Sir au cœur loyal, la relation entre le couple royal, déjà forte, avait été renforcée par la réussite de Catherine à produire un héritier mâle. Connu sous le nom de Petit Prince Hal et Le Garçon du Nouvel An, le prince était admiré par la cour.
Cependant, le 23 février 1511, le jeune prince mourut subitement. La cause de sa mort n'a pas été rapportée. Il reçut des funérailles nationales de l'abbaye de Westminster. La reine Catherine attendit encore deux ans avant de tomber une troisième fois enceinte. Il n'y a aucun portrait connu du Prince Henri.
La très pieuse reine Catherine passa de nombreuses heures à prier l'âme de son fils tandis qu'Henri VIII détourna sa colère en faisant la guerre à Louis XII de France.

En 1451 il est créé 1er Lord Fleming Baron de Biggar Lord du Parlement avec le titre de « Lord Fleming de Cumbernaud ». Sa fonction de « Maitre de la Maison royale  » de Jacques II d'Écosse et sa proximité avec la famille royale, comme petit-fils de Robert Stuart duc d'Albany, fait de lui en 1465 un gardien de l'Écosse pendant la minorité de Jacques III d'Ecosse.

606,"Maxime Daniel, né le 5 juin 1991 à Rennes, est un coureur cycliste professionnel français, membre de l'équipe Fortuneo-Oscaro.


== Biographie ==
Maxime Daniel débute en 2003 au Vélo Club Saint Hilaire puis à l'Étoile cycliste rennaise. Il intègre, à la sortie des juniors, l'équipe de division nationale Sojasun espoir-ACNC, basée à Noyal-Châtillon-sur-Seiche, en Ille-et-Vilaine.
En 2012, il remporte le ZLM Tour (manche de la Coupe des Nations espoirs) et termine 5e du Tour des Flandres espoirs. Ses bonnes performances lui permettent d'être recruté par l'équipe professionnelle Sojasun, avec laquelle il signe un contrat de deux ans.
Pour ses débuts professionnels en 2013, Maxime Daniel est troisième de la première étape du Tour méditerranéen en février. Au mois d'août, il remporte sa première victoire professionnelle, lors du 75e Tour du Portugal. Il passe près du succès à l'arrivée de la première étape, où il règle le sprint du peloton, seulement devancé par Alexander Serov, parti dans les derniers hectomètres. Il se rattrape six jours plus tard. Cette fois-ci personne ne précède le peloton et Maxime Daniel s'adjuge la sixième étape, à l'issue d'un sprint massif. Bien protégé par Yannick Talabardon jusqu’au deux kilomètres, il prend la roue de Jimmy Engoulvent aux huit cents mètres, Daniel lance le sprint à quatre cents mètres de la ligne. Sur son démarrage, il creuse un léger écart qui lui permet de s'imposer.
À l'issue de cette saison, tandis que l'équipe Sojasun disparaît, Maxime Daniel est recruté pour trois ans par la formation AG2R La Mondiale.
Il commence l'année 2014 en Australie, au Tour Down Under, dans l'anonymat des classements. Il s'octroie par la suite quelques accessits lors de différentes épreuves comme le Tour du Poitou-Charentes où il se classe second de la première étape derrière Mark Cavendish.
Au mois de novembre 2016, il s'engage avec l'équipe continentale professionnelle française Fortuneo-Vital Concept. Retenu avec sa nouvelle équipe pour participer à Paris-Nice dans l'optique d'épauler Daniel McLay, il doit finalement renoncer à l'épreuve, souffrant d'une tendinite à la cheville contractée après les premières classiques flandriennes. Sur la Ronde de l'Oise, il passe proche de la victoire, 2e de la deuxième et de la quatrième étape, devancé par Yannis Yssaad puis Jordan Levasseur. Le 21 juin, en Belgique, il termine 4e de Halle-Ingooigem, remportée par Arnaud Démare, puis 7e du GP Cerami mi-juillet. En août, sur le Tour de l'Ain, il complète le podium lors d'une étape dédiée aux sprinters, précédé par Nacer Bouhanni et Samuel Dumoulin. Le 16 août, son équipe annonce sa prolongation pour deux saisons supplémentaires.

607,"Simon Ammann, né le 25 juin 1981 à Grabs dans le canton de Saint-Gall (Suisse), est un sauteur à ski suisse licencié au RG Churfirsten. Il détient le record du nombre de médailles d'or olympiques individuelles dans sa discipline, avec quatre titres (deux en 2002 à Salt Lake City et deux en 2010 à Vancouver).


== Biographie ==
Il a épousé la Russe Yana Yanovskaya le 25 juin 2010 à Pfäffikon.
En novembre 2012, il a obtenu sa licence de pilote privé.


== Parcours sportif ==
Simon Amman a commencé à pratiquer le saut à ski à l'âge de onze ans. Il fait ses débuts internationaux en fin d'année 1997 à Oberstdorf terminant quinzième. Il réussit à se qualifier pour les Jeux olympiques de Nagano en 1998 où il finit trente-cinquième en individuel.
Considéré comme l'un des meilleurs sauteurs des années 2000, il est le seul sauteur de l'histoire à avoir remporté quatre titres olympiques en individuel, deux lors des Jeux olympiques d'hiver de 2002 et deux lors des Jeux olympiques d'hiver de 2010. À noter qu'en 2002, bien qu'il n'était pas cité parmi les favoris et n'avait pas encore remporté de concours en Coupe du monde, le Suisse est devenu le deuxième sauteur à gagner les deux concours individuels aux mêmes Jeux olympiques après le Finlandais Matti Nykänen. Un mois plus tard, il confirme ces succès par sa première victoire en Coupe du monde lors de la manche d'Oslo.
Il a également décroché deux titres de champion du monde en 2007 sur grand tremplin et en 2010 en vol à ski. Il compte à son palmarès trois autres médailles aux mondiaux (l'une en argent en 2007 sur petit tremplin, une en bronze en 2009 sur petit tremplin et une en argent en 2011 sur grand tremplin). Vainqueur de vingt-et-une épreuves sur le circuit de la Coupe du monde pour un total de soixante-treize podiums, il a décroché, en 2010, le globe de cristal de la spécialité grâce à ses victoires lors de la Tournée nordique et sur neuf concours cette saison. Enfin, il atteint son meilleur classement sur la Tournée des quatre tremplins lors des saisons 2008-2009 (deuxième place derrière l'Autrichien Wolfgang Loitzl) et 2010-2011 (deuxième place derrière l'Autrichien Thomas Morgenstern).
Il est le détenteur du record de Suisse avec un saut de 238,5 mètres, ce qui correspond à la septième plus longue distance validée derrière les 246,5 mètres de Johan Remen Evensen.
Ses doublés lors des Jeux olympiques de 2002 et de 2010 l'ont conduit à recevoir le prix de « sportif suisse de l'année » en 2002 et en 2010. Fils de fermiers, il a été surnommé « Harry Potter » pour sa ressemblance avec le personnage lors des JO de 2002.
Il a été désigné porte-drapeau de la délégation suisse pour la cérémonie d'ouverture des Jeux olympiques d'hiver de 2014.

608,"Enzo Giudici (Mussomeli, 24 septembre 1920 – Rome, 4 octobre 1985) est un universitaire italien, spécialiste de la littérature française de la Renaissance, en particulier Louise Labé et Maurice Scève. C'est aussi un essayiste lié au fascisme.


== Biographie ==
Enzo Giudici est le fils d'Isabella Sorce et de Paolo Giudici, enseignant et romancier. Il perd sa mère à l'âge de 3 ans. À l'âge de 10 ans, il quitte la Sicile pour suivre son père à Piacenza, Pavie, Potenza, puis Rome.
Durant ses études, il est proche du Gruppo Universitario Fascista,. Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, Giudici n'est pas conscrit en raison de sa santé. Il contribue à Orizzonte, l'organe officiel de la Xe MAS et à Fronte Unico, un hebdomadaire « virulent dirigé par Vito Videtta, un membre de la banda extrémiste de Pietro Koch. Dans un article de décembre 1943, Giudici soutient que le fascisme nie les classes et les individus, en demeurant totalitaire et corporatif. Il collabore également à « Libro e moschetto », le journal du Gruppo Universitario Fascista. Dans Universalità e nazionalità delle guerre (Universalité et nationalité des guerres), un article publié en avril 1943 dans Libro e moschetto, il écrit: « La guerre actuelle est en même temps universelle et nationale. Les valeurs et le sort du monde y sont déterminés, à travers notre conscience italienne. Ce combat est clairement entre deux siècles et deux idées, certes entre deux peuples, mais ce sont les peuples qui incarnent et représentent les idées ». En 1944, pendant la république sociale italienne, il débat avec Roberto Farinacci sur des réformes dans la revue Repubblica fascista. Il écrit dans la revue Repubblica Sociale, un mensuel dirigé par Manlio Sargenti (it), un article sur « Économie socialisée et économie corporative »,. La même année, il écrit un livre sur la socialisation des entreprises,. En 1946, il est le vice-président du conseil directeur (vicepresidente dell consiglio direttivo), du Movimento Italiano di Unità Sociale, un nouveau parti réunissant l'élite fasciste et précurseur, non seulement par le nom, du MSI,. En 1947 il collabore au Pensiero nazionale (it), un magazine dirigé par Stanis Ruinas (it) qui vise à rassembler les « ex fascistes de gauche ».
En 1948, il réussit à trouver du travail, enseignant dans des écoles de différents niveaux.
Le journaliste italien Gino Raya (it) note la « sensibilité »  de Giudici au jeu d'échecs: il voyage loin pour participer à des tournois, polémique sur l'introduction en Italie du classement Elo et écrit un article sur son rôle dans la litterature.
Il décède en 1985 à la suite d'une brève maladie. Sa bibliothèque de plus de 20.000 livres est maintenant à l'université de Lecce.


== Carrière universitaire ==
Lecteur à l'université de Toulouse 1957-1962.
Professeur de français et de littérature française à l'université du Salento et à l'université de Naples « L'Orientale » (1962-1965).
Professeur à l'université de Macerata (1966-1982).
Professeur à l'université de Rome « Tor Vergata » après 1982.


== Études sur l'école de Lyon ==
Ses contributions universitaires ""prolifiques"" sont centrées sur l'école de Lyon, en particulier Louise Labé, et Maurice Scève,,, l'inventeur présumé de la prétendue tombe de Laure de Sade,,, chez lesquels il s'est notamment intéressé à l'influence de Pétrarque,, dont certains auteurs considèrent toutefois qu'il a exagéré l'importance,. En 1958, il publie une édition critique des œuvres mineures de Scève et, en 1976, la première édition véritablement critique, - mais considérée depuis comme partielle et dépassée - de Microcosme, la dernière œuvre de Scève. En 1981, il publie une édition savante des œuvres de Labé, considérée ""solide"" et ""luxuriante"", bien qu'elle ait été depuis estimée incomplète,. Son travail d'éditeur aux notes parfois excessives et légèrement décourageantes ainsi que ses recherches documentaires sont plus appréciés de certains spécialistes pour leur « densité d'information », que pour la pertinence de leurs analyses littéraires,. Ses travaux, qui contribuèrent au renouveau de l'intérêt pour ces poètes, lui valurent un prix d'honneur de l'Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts de Lyon.


== Essais ==
Giudici est l'objet de critiques pour ses relations durables avec le fascisme. Dans Memorie e pensieri di un cattedratico (Mémoires et pensées d'un professeur universitaire), il considère ces évocations comme de viles et fausses confusions de la culture avec la politique. Il ajoute que l'opposition fascisme-antifascisme est, selon lui, une antithèse dépassée et controversée et qu'il se méfie des ismes contemporains. Bien que l'historien italien Carlo Vallauri ait noté en 1994 que Giudici ""ne s'est jamais identifié"" avec le MSI, des affinités, parfois considérées comme l'expression d'un « non-conformisme » de « nouvelle droite »,, transparaissent dans ses prises de position sur les mouvements étudiants et sur la culture du fascisme.
Dans L' avvento dell'asinocrazia (L'asinocratie qui vient) et Contestatori alla sbarra (Contestataires à la barre), il critique le mouvement étudiant qui avait commencé en Italie en 1967. Son analyse est considérée par Carlo Vallauri comme « l'expression la plus claire et la plus organique du refus de comprendre » ce mouvement. L'expression avvento dell'asinocrazia fut d'abord employée en 1968 par Giovanni Sartori, dans un article publié par le Corriere della Sera, pour caractériser le mouvement étudiant comme un ""triomphe des ânes"". Dans La scuola inutile (L'école inutile), Giudici critique non seulement les étudiants « contestataires », mais aussi la classe politique qu'il juge « renonciataire ».
À partir de la fin des années 1970, Giudici collabore au Secolo d'Italia, le journal du MSI, y contribuant à un débat sur la culture de la période fasciste. Il s'interroge sur le point de savoir si le fascisme était « seulement respectueux de la culture ou lui-même producteur de culture » et souligne son «  lien avec le Risorgimento et la Rome antique ». Ces considérations sont développées dans Ricerche sulla cultura dell'era fascista (Réflexions sur la culture durant la période fasciste) et dans Riflessioni sulla cultura del periodo fascista, publié posthumément par l'Istituto di studi corporativi de Gaetano Rasi (it), un centre d'études et de réflexions du MSI,, où Giudici intègre les analyses de Robert Michels sur le syncrétisme di Mussolini. Dans ce dernier livre, Giudici condamne l'antisémitisme fasciste. L'historien italien Gianni Rossi relève que Giudici, s'il ne nie ni ne minimisme pas l'antisémitisme mussolinien, y voit une certaine forme de ""réticence"".

== Biographie ==
Après ses performances à la St. Michael's Academy High School de New York, elle est retenue pour le WBCA High School All-American Game de 2005.
Formée à l'Université Rutgers, où elle fait équipe avec Essence Carson, elle en sort diplômée en journalisme. Elle finit son cursus seconde réalisatrice aux contres (279) et aux rebonds (1 079) et parmi les quatre joueuses à additionner au moins 1 000 points et 1 000 rebonds. Avec Sue Wicks, elle est la seule joueuse des Scarlet Knights à mener quatre années consécutives aux rebonds. En 2007, elle atteint la finale NCAA face à Tennessee.
Draftée en 2009 en huitième position par le Liberty de New York, elle joue moins d'une dizaine de minutes par rencontre ses deux premières saisons en WNBA. Puis profitant des départs de Taj McWilliams-Franklin et Janel McCarville, elle s'impose avec des statistiques de 11,6 points et 7,2 rebonds après 13 matches, tous débutés dans le cinq de départ. Sa progression en fait une candidate sérieuse au titre de Joueuse ayant le plus progressé, titre qu'elle obtient finalement.
En 2010, elle rejoint la pré-sélection américaine de 24 joueuses, mais n'est pas retenue dans l'équipe finale qui dispute le Mondial 2010.
Lors de la saison 2013-2014, Prague remporte le championnat et les play-offs en finissant la saison invaincu (41 victoires) et remporte de surcroît la Coupe de République tchèque avec des statistiques personnelles de 11,8 points et 9,3 rebonds en Euroligue et 15,7 points et 7,4 rebonds en championnat.
Lors de la saison 2014-2015, Prague remporte l'Euroligue 72 à 68 face à l'UMMC Iekaterinbourg, Kia Vaughn (18 points et 12 rebonds en finale) recevant le titre de MVP du tournoi final à quatre.
Le 30 janvier 2017, les Mystics de Washington transfèrent Kia Vaughn avec Bria Hartley au Liberty de New York dans un transfert complexe impliquant trois équipes.

== Résumé ==
Une nuit d'hiver, dans un cimetière près de la Gartempe, le Démon décide de faire revenir à la vie six personnes mortes depuis deux ans au plus : une fillette de cinq ans, une jeune femme de vingt-deux ans, un « grand paysan » de quarante-trois ans, un jeune homme roux de dix-neuf ans, un « vieux » de soixante-douze ans et une « vieille » de quatre-vingt-six ans. Ils auront une journée pour retourner dans leur foyer respectif sous leur forme d'être humain ou sous une forme animale, végétale ou minérale. Au bout de ce jour ils retourneront à leur tombe.
Alors que le jour se lève ils s'éparpillent, tentant de retrouver le chemin de leur maison. Certains se souviennent de leur mort (que l'auteur nomme « l'absence ») d'autres partiellement jusqu'à midi, certains enfin ont tout oublié et s'étonnent de ce plein hiver alors qu'hier encore les journées annonçaient l'été. La plupart des six personnages sont mal accueillis dans leur foyers respectifs, d'autant que leur apparence, si elle fait illusion au premier abord pour les parents, les maris ou les enfants, ne fait pas d'eux des vivants à part entière. Les animaux par exemple ne s'y trompent pas et plus d'un chien recule effrayé et hurlant devant ces créatures de l'au-delà.
À part « la vieille », aucun ne choisira de changer d'apparence. Ce sera la seule à choisir de devenir châtaigne, posée au coin du feu. Ce changement de forme sera sa malédiction : elle seule sera oubliée par le démon et restera à jamais sur la surface de la terre, ballottée par les vents, les pluies et le « jeu des circonstances heureuses ou non ».

620,"Le carré Hermès est un foulard en soie de forme carrée, emblématique de la maison française Hermès.
Lancé en 1937, il est devenu un classique et une icône de la marque, parfois qualifié, selon les sources, d'intemporel, transgénérationnel,, voire de mythique. Ce foulard, tout comme le sac Kelly, la couleur orange propre à la marque, ou la calèche du logo, illustre et personnifie la société Hermès.


== Préambule ==
Le mouchoir imprimé, comme accessoire de mode féminine indispensable d'une l'époque, apparait au XIXe siècle. Ce mouchoir, en grandissant se rapproche du foulard, pour devenir également masculin en se transformant en « mouchoirs de cou ». Les soldats d'alors sont dotés de mouchoirs imprimés sur lesquels on trouve des motifs militaires, voire des instructions illustrées, pour les combattants analphabètes. Durant le début de la Première Guerre mondiale, les motifs imprimés sur le mouchoir de cou changent, y compris pour les femmes où ceux-ci prennent une inspiration militaire ou tout du moins masculine. Alors que les manuels d'instruction militaire sont rendus obligatoires vers 1937, les soldats étant censés savoir lire, Hermès va s'inspirer de cette tradition.


== Historique ==

Tout juste un siècle après la création de la société par Thierry Hermès, Robert Dumas, directeur d'Hermès, réalise en 1937 le premier carré avec le nom de Jeu des omnibus et Dames blanches (réédité depuis avec d'autres couleurs), inspiré d'une sorte de jeu de l'Oie très populaire à l'époque. Hermès donne le nom de « papillon » à chaque petit carré de soie car chacun d'eux est produit par le nombre d’œufs (300) que pond un vers à soie dans une vie, soit quatre cent cinquante kilomètres de soie.
À l'origine, les illustrations étaient proches du monde équestre et de la chasse comme Jumping ou La promenade à Longchamp, pour évoluer ensuite vers les animaux, les arts, l'épopée napoléonienne, ou l'automobile, thèmes revenant régulièrement dans les collections, puis le sport en général avec par exemple une édition pour les Jeux olympiques d'été de 1984.
De nos jours, les dessins sont très variés, du plus classique au plus contemporain comme les modèles En désordre, celui à base de graffitis et typographie, 24 H, Please check-in en 70 cm, ou le Magic Kelly comportant une illustration en trois dimensions, un autostéréogramme. Tous réalisés dans les ateliers de la région lyonnaise de la marque et signés « Hermès Paris », les carrés peuvent être sur des thèmes classiques comme Les Toits de Paris ou Souvenirs de Paris, Noël au 24 faubourg, ou plus exotiques comme Kilim reprenant l'idée d'un tapis, Marché flottant du lac Inlé à l'inspiration asiatique, Indien Pani La Shar Pawnee, ou encore Perles du Kenya.
Il se porte autour du cou, pour tenir les cheveux, noué comme un pirate autour de la tête, mais également comme ceinture, noué autour de l'anse d'un sac, au poignet, ou autour de la cheville ainsi que noué à la chaussure… Il peut même dans certain cas remplacer un petit sac à main et être détourné pour beaucoup d'autres usages vestimentaires. Pour sa première collection chez Hermès en 2004, Jean Paul Gaultier, remplaçant Martin Margiela, a imbriqué des carrés dans ses créations.
Hermès décline en étole moderne de grand format, tel un paréo, ce célèbre carré de soie (à ne pas confondre avec le sari vendu en Inde), et invite régulièrement des artistes du monde entier à proposer des illustrations, ; ces illustrations peuvent être modifiées, colorisées différemment, puis rééditées au cours des années.


=== Le carré en chiffres ===
Depuis 1937 date de sa création, plus de 1 500 motifs sérigraphiés différents ont été édités, composés en moyenne d'une cinquantaine de couleurs parmi un nuancier de 75 000 couleurs de base. Chaque exemplaire est archivé dans la « carréothèque » de la maison Hermès, et il s'en vend un exemplaire toutes les 30 minutes dans le monde, pour une collection renouvelée tous les six mois. Certaines illustrations voient leur commercialisation très réduite, avec des éditions de quelques unités.
Bien que traditionnellement aux dimensions de 90 cm de côté, plus récemment une collection, destinée également aux hommes, intitulée Carré 70 de 70 cm a été éditée pour les 70 ans du carré en 2007.


=== Autour du carré au cours des années ===
Pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, un exemplaire est réalisé sur le thème du « Retour à la terre », prôné par le régime de Vichy.
Pour le film Le Parrain (1972), un modèle spécial est édité.
Dans le film de 2006 Le Diable s’habille en Prada, Miranda Priestly envoie son assistante acheter des dizaines de carrés Hermès blancs.
Le peintre Josef Albers a eu l'honneur posthume en 2008 d'avoir six de ses œuvres reproduites sur des carrés Hermès.
Six foulards mêlant différents motifs sont réalisés pour le grand magasin Liberty de Londres fin 2009.
colette commercialise fin 2010 une collection capsule détournée du modèle de référence Brides de Gala dessiné à l'origine par Hugo Grygkar et datant de 1957, l'une des meilleures ventes de la maison Hermès, ainsi que d'autres déclinaisons.
Rei Kawakubo signe deux collections minimalistes de onze carrés au total, fin 2012.

Mick Doohan a remporté son troisième championnat du monde avec 8 victoires et Àlex Crivillé fini deuxième avec deux victoires. Tadayuki Okada a terminé septième et Shinichi Itoh douzième.
Le format à quatre pilotes a été maintenu en 1997 avec Michael Doohan, Àlex Crivillé et Tadayuki Okada sur Honda NSR500 et Takuma Aoki sur Honda NSR500V. Le Team Repsol Honda a remporté les 15 courses de la saison dont 12 gagnées par Mick Doohan. Tadayuki Okada a terminé deuxième avec une victoire.

Àlex Crivillé, Tadayuki Okada et Sete Gibernau sont restés avec l'équipe pour l'année 2000, tous sur des Honda NSR500. 2000 a été une année difficile pour le team Repsol Honda. Àlex Crivillé n'a remporté qu'une course et a terminé neuvième au classement général. Tadayuki Okada a terminé onzième et Sete Gibernau quinzième.
En 2001 Àlex Crivillé a été rejoint par Tohru Ukawa. La saison n'était pas vraiment meilleure qu'en 2000. Àlex Crivillé n'est monté que sur 2 podiums et a terminé huitième cette année-là. Tohru Ukawa a terminé dixième avec un podium à son actif.
2002 fut l'année du changement avec le passage à la nouvelle catégorie : le MotoGP. Valentino Rossi a rejoint l'équipe aux côtés de Tohru Ukawa cette fois ci sur des Honda RC211V 1 000 cm3, les deux autres pilotes étaient Alex Barros et Daijiro Kato. Valentino Rossi a dominé la saison et avec onze victoires, ce qui lui permis de devenir champion du monde à quatre courses de la fin de saison. Tohru Ukawa, quant à lui, avec une victoire et huit podiums, a terminé troisième au classement général.
Nicky Hayden, Champion de l'année 2002 en AMA Superbike a rejoint Valentino Rossi pour le millésime 2003. Valentino Rossi avec neuf victoires et une place sur le podium de chaque courses, est devenu champion du monde pour la troisième fois d'affilée. Nicky Hayden a terminé cinquième au classement général avec deux podiums.
À la suite du départ de Valentino Rossi, le vétéran des Grand Prix Moto Alex Barros a rejoint Nicky Hayden en 2004. Alex Barros a terminé quatrième de la saison et Nicky Hayden cinquième. Les deux pilotes ont eu des podiums mais pas de victoires.
Pour 2005 Max Biaggi rejoint l'équipe. Nicky Hayden a obtenu sa première victoire en MotoGP grâce à une course à domicile, au Grand Prix des États-Unis, il a terminé troisième au classement général. Max Biaggi a terminé cinquième avec quatre podiums.
En 2006, Nicky Hayden a été rejoint par le Champion du Monde 250 cm3 Dani Pedrosa. Nicky Hayden a mené le championnat, mais au Grand Prix du Portugal, son coéquipier Dani Pedrosa, insouciant, s'est accroché avec lui. Les deux pilotes étaient hors course et Valentino Rossi (pilote Yamaha racing) a pris la tête du championnat. Dans la dernière course de la saison, Rossi est tombé de sa moto au 5e tour, en essayant de rattraper un mauvais départ. Hayden qui a fait une course prudente, a assuré une troisième place et est ainsi devenu champion du monde. Sur cette saison, il a obtenu 2 victoires et huit podiums. Dani Pedrosa a pour sa part terminé cinquième, avec 2 victoires et 5 podiums.
La composition de l'équipe est resté identique pour 2007. Cette année-là, c'est la nouvelle Honda RC212V en 800 cm3 qui fut utilisée. La nouvelle moto n'eut pas le succès escompté tout de suite mais plus tard dans la saison, à la suite d'améliorations apportées par le HRC. Dani Pedrosa a obtenu deux victoires. Nicky Hayden a terminé huitième de la saison.
Pour 2008, Dani Pedrosa et Nicky Hayden était encore les hommes forts de ce team. Pendant la saison, Pedrosa est passé en pneus Bridgestone et une séparation a été installée entre les box de Pedrosa et Hayden, pour empêcher l'observation des données relatives aux pneumatiques. Plus tôt dans la saison, une séparation entre les box de Rossi et de son coéquipier équipé en pneus Michelin, Jorge Lorenzo, avait déjà été mise en place.
Dani Pedrosa ainsi qu'Andrea Dovizioso sont les coureurs de l'équipe pour l'année 2008.
En 2010, le Directeur de l'équipe HRC, Kazuhiko Yamano, supervise toutes les opérations, y compris les équipes d'usine et les équipes satellites. Toshiyuki Yamaji remplace Yamano en tant que Team Manager et dirige l'ensemble de l'équipe Repsol Honda. Alberto Puig est le gérant de l'équipe de Pedrosa et Gianni Berti est le gérant de l'équipe de Dovizioso. Shinichi Kokubu est le directeur technique en Grand Prix, il supervise les six RC212V du championnat MotoGP.
Pour 2011, Dani Pedrosa, Andrea Dovizioso, Casey Stoner sont les pilotes de l'équipe. Shuhei Nakamoto, vice-président du HRC, dirige toutes les équipes MotoGP. Shinichi Kokubu est le directeur technique, et Livio Suppo directeur de la communication et du marketing. Le team Respol Honda a gagné sa centième victoire en catégorie reine, le dimanche 18 septembre 2011 au grand prix d'Aragon avec la victoire de Casey Stoner.

622,"La Halle Puget est un bâtiment situé à proximité de la Porte d'Aix à Marseille.
Elle est due au maître maçon Pierre Puget (homonyme du sculpteur) en 1672. Elle est construite pour remplacer l'ancienne halle aux poissons de la place Vivaux devenue trop petite après l'extension de la ville.
Elle abritait le marché aux poissons et aux viandes au XVIIe siècle.
Tour à tour, transformée en chapelle (en 1887) puis en commissariat (de 1925 à 1980), la halle avait été alors murée et les colonnes encastrées, sa restauration, en 1987, lui rend son apparence initiale.
Construite à l'image d'un temple antique, son toit de tuile repose sur des colonnes ioniques : 5 en largeur, 7 en longueur.

623,"Une pince à sein est un jouet sexuel utilisé pour stimuler les tétons en y appliquant une pression plus ou moins importante. Son effet principal est de restreindre la circulation du sang dans les tétons. Ces pinces sont souvent utilisées dans les activités BDSM, par les hommes et les femmes. L'utilisation des pinces à seins est souvent utilisé par les médias comme un élément typique de sexualité déviante ou perverse.
La pince à linge est également utilisée pour ce même type d'activité. Comme ils s'agit d'objets non prévus pour cet usage, l'application requiert que l'utilisateur trouve un bon équilibre entre le plaisir et la souffrance.
Certains poids peuvent être utilisés. Ceux-ci découragent les personnes pincées de trop bouger (par exemple, sauter lors d'une fessée érotique), cependant le fait que le poids puisse balancer et augmenter la douleur peut également faire partie du jeu. La douleur la plus forte et la plus persistante n'est pas ressentie pendant le port, mais après : il vaut mieux donc éviter de s'endormir avec ou de les porter pendant une journée complète.


== Usage et matière ==
Il ne s'agit plus de parure, mais d'accessoires sexuels apparentés aux pratiques BDSM. Le but est d'appliquer une pression plus ou moins forte, et plus ou moins contrôlée, aux mamelons, créant une stimulation pouvant aller d'un doux serrage jusqu'à la douleur la plus vive. Diverses matières plastiques ou métalliques. Elles sont souvent revêtues d'un enrobage plastifié ou caoutchouté aux extrémités, mais il en existe avec des dents crantées, à réserver aux vrais adeptes du SM.


== Formes ==
Façon « pinces croco », ou « pinces médicales » (ressemblant vaguement à des ciseaux) et leurs dérivés.

On trouve des pinces classiques simples dont la force du ressort sera choisie en fonction de l'intensité voulue. Certaines peuvent blesser si de trop mauvaise qualité ou si choisies dans une gamme volontairement SM[réf. nécessaire].
Ces mêmes modèles sont parfois équipés d'une vis de réglage autorisant une limitation de la fermeture des mâchoires afin d'en doser la pression. Les modèles « clamps » sont par définition assortis de crans donnant un serrage progressif. Certaines pinces n'ont pas de ressort de serrage : la pression est alors finement ajustée par une vis de serrage. L'ensemble des pinces peut se trouver associé à des chaines ou des poids amovibles ou fixes, quelques fois très lourds, destinés aux jeux sévères. Il existe aussi des pinces associées à des vibromasseurs : elles émettent des vibrations.
Il existe aussi des pinces avec des chaines qui les relient à un cockring pour ces messieurs ou au clitoris pour ces dames et des pinces reliées à des anneaux pour recevoir de nouvelles attaches. Enfin des pinces bijoux pour mettre en avant son corps et sa résistance.
Ces pinces sont aussi adaptées à d'autres zones du corps comme les lèvres vulvaires, les bourses ou même les oreilles. La seule limite est l'imagination des joueurs.

625,"Ermentar de Noirmoutier, également appelé Ermentarius Tornusiensis (fl. 863), était un moine et historien de l'abbaye de Saint-Philibert de Tournus. Il a écrit chronique en prose un article, De translationibus et miraculis sancti Filiberti. Ce récit narre les péripéties de sa communauté, dissipée par les Vikings et suite à son transfert de l'île bretonne de Noirmoutier à plusieurs endroits en France. Elle s'est installée à Tournus, depuis 875, après la mort de l'auteur. Le récit est cadré autour du transfert des reliques du moine de son abbaye Saint Philibert de Jumièges, et les miracles qu'il a accomplis sur l'abbaye du même nom.
Ermentar était un moine au service de Hilbod, qui devint abbé de l'ile de Noirmoutier en exil autour de 826. Les moines avaient commencés la construction d'un nouveau monastère dans la villa de Déas le prédécesseur d'Hilbod, Arnoul, qui est mort en 824/825. En 839 environ, Ermentar a écrit sa première œuvre, la Vita sancti Filiberti, récitant la vie de Saint Philibert, basé sur une version antérieure du septième siècle de la biographie. En 847, les moines ont quitté la ville de Déas au profit de Cunault. En 862, ils ont abandonné Cunault pour Messay, en Aquitaine, où  des reliques de Philibert arrivèrent le 1er mai. Ce fut l'occasion pour Ermentar d'écrire De translationibus. L'abbé Hilbod est décédé cette année et a été succédé pendant un court laps de temps par un abbé nommé Ermentar. Malheureusement, il n'existe aucun enregistrement permettant de savoir si l'abbé et l'historien sont la même personne. L'historien est mort en 860.
Ermentar rapporte les premières invasions Viking sur l'Europe continentale à l'encontre de son monastère, en 799. Selon lui, plus de 819 les moines ont été contraints de passer l'été sur le continent en raison des Vikings. En 836, ils ont finalement déménagé l'intérieur des terres, en 843 toute l'année, les Vikings ayant pris Noirmoutier et en ont fait leur base pour des invasions en France. L'histoire d'Ermentar est précieuse, mais pas entièrement digne de confiance, ni une source fiable. Il a écrit avec une indignation partiale à propos de la cruauté des païens.

626,"Les barres de flèches sont des petits espars, perpendiculaires au mât des voiliers, permettant une meilleure tenue des mâts en écartant les haubans afin d'avoir un meilleur angle de maintien et diminuer la compression sur le mât. Elles trouvent leur origine (et leur nom) dans le besoin de raidir le mât de flèche, un mât amovible utilisé pour établir un flèche, souvent une voile au tiers, au-dessus d'une voile aurique, pour augmenter la surface de voilure par petit temps.
L'ensemble des petites barres de flèche visibles en haut des mâts au point d'accroche de l'étai et inversées par rapport à leur usage habituel est appelé guignol. Son rôle est de mieux pouvoir régler la partie haute du mât selon la même recherche d'augmentation et, dans ce cas, d'orientation, de l'angle de tension des câbles de réglage.
On peut trouver des barres de flèche sur d'autres objets que des mâts, par exemple, certains tubes (grue) sont renforcés par le même dispositif dans le but d'augmenter la rigidité d'un ensemble sans modification de la section du profil le constituant.

631,"Sainte-Thérèse est une ville dans la municipalité régionale de comté (MRC) de Thérèse-De Blainville au Québec (Canada), située dans la région administrative des Laurentides a environ 30 kilomètres au nord de la ville de Montréal . Elle s’est récemment classée au troisième rang des villes les mieux administrées au Québec.
La ville est nommée en l'honneur de Marie-Thérèse Dugué de Boisbriand (1671-1744). La paroisse Sainte-Thérèse y est chapeautée par le plus haut clocher du Canada.


== Histoire ==

Le 23 septembre 1683, en reconnaissance de ses services militaires, Joseph-Antoine Le Febvre de La Barre (gouverneur de la Nouvelle-France) concède la seigneurie des Mille-Îles à Michel-Sidrac Dugué de Boisbriand. L'exploitation de la seigneurie de 9 milles carrés débute en 1714 lorsque Marie-Thérèse Dugué de Boisbriand et son mari Charles Piot de Langloiserie prennent possession de la Seigneurie. En 1715, Langloiserie décède et sa femme, n'ayant pas l'énergie de s'occuper du travail de colonisation des terres, laisse la Seigneurie à l'abandon.
Il faut attendre en 1743 alors que Suzanne de Langloiserie et son mari Jean-Baptiste Céloron de Blainville prennent possession des terres. Le 15 octobre 1789, Marie-Anne Thérèse de Blainville, à qui la Seigneurie de Blainville a été léguée conjointement avec sa sœur Marie-Hypolite de Blainville, inaugure la paroisse Sainte-Thérèse-d'Ávila.
Le 1er juin 1849, le Village de Sainte-Thérèse voit le jour à la suite d'une demande de Louis Marteau, Paul Filiatrault et Joseph-Benjamin Lachaîne au Conseil des paroisses du comté de Terrebonne. Le Village deviendra officiellement une Ville en 1916.

633,"Le Kerak de Moab ou Krak des Moabites est un château fort datant du XIIe siècle, à l'époque des Croisades. Il est situé à Kerak, l'actuelle ville d'Al-Karak en Jordanie.


== Histoire ==

La construction de cette imposante forteresse croisée commence autour de 1140, sous la direction de Payen le Bouteiller, le majordome de Foulque V d'Anjou. Les Croisés l'ont appelé le krak des Moabites ou Kerak de Moab, comme cela est indiqué dans les livres d'histoire (voir krak des Chevaliers, autre forteresse avec laquelle il est souvent confondu). Le château fort se situe au sud d'un plateau rocheux. C'est un bel exemple d'architecture des Croisés, un mélange de style européen, byzantin et arabe.
Payen était à la tête de la Seigneurie d'Outre-Jourdain en transjordanie, et Karak était devenu son fief, en remplacement de celui de Montréal moins bien protégé et plus au sud.
Le krak de Moab est connu pour avoir abrité Renaud de Châtillon. Ce krak est le plus proche de Jérusalem des trois châteaux connus (krak des chevaliers, krak de Moab, krak de Montréal). Il est construit sur une montagne rocheuse et comporte des douves allant jusqu’à 20 m de haut. Comme chaque krak, il était conçu pour résister à de longs sièges, autant par ses approvisionnements que par ses défenses. Il est encore debout.
C'est de là que Renaud de Châtillon organisa des attaques de caravanes sarrasines escortées de marchands se déplaçant du Caire à Damas et de pèlerins allant à La Mecque. Il fit emprisonner des marchands dans Kérak, ce qui déclencha le siège du krak par Saladin en 1183. Assiégé, Renaud fit allumer un grand brasier en haut du donjon de la citadelle, celui-ci visible de plusieurs kilomètres, permit d'alerter l’ost royal de Jérusalem, alors encore commandé par le roi lépreux Baudouin IV. Baudouin vint au secours de Kérak et Saladin décida de lever le siège. Mais ce siège eut pour effet de rompre la trêve qui existait alors entre Saladin et Raymond III de Tripoli et cela déclencha la guerre sainte, la bataille de Hattin et la prise de Jérusalem par Saladin, dernier échec qui engendra en partie la 3e croisade.
Après la bataille de Hattin en 1187, Saladin fait à nouveau le siège de Karak et finit par le prendre en 1189. La légende raconte qu'au cours du siège les assiégés durent vendre femmes et enfants pour acheter de la nourriture.[réf. nécessaire]
En 1263, le mamelouk Baybars agrandit le krak et construit une tour au coin nord-ouest du château.
En 1840, Ibrahim Pacha prend possession de la place et détruit la quasi-totalité de ses fortifications.


== Postérité ==
Le musée archéologique de Karak est situé dans la cour basse du château. Il a été entièrement rénové et a rouvert ses portes en 2004. Il présente l'histoire locale et l'archéologie de la région depuis la période préhistorique jusqu'à l'ère islamique. Il se concentre particulièrement sur l'histoire des croisés au sein de leur forteresse d'Al-Karak.

634,"La rivière Rivière du Hibou est un affluent du lac Parent (Abitibi), coulant dans la ville de Senneterre, dans la municipalité régionale de comté (MRC) de La Vallée-de-l'Or, dans la région administrative de l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue, au Québec, au Canada.
Le cours de la rivière traverse successivement les cantons de Brassier et Delestre. La rivière Rivière du Hibou coule entièrement en territoire forestier et en zone de marais à l’Est du lac Parent (Abitibi) (rivière Bell). La foresterie constitue la principale activité économique de ce versant hydrographique.
La surface de la rivière est habituellement gelée de la mi-décembre à la mi-avril.


== Géographie ==
La rivière Rivière du Hibou prend sa source à l’embouchure d’un ruisseau draine une zone humide à 346 m d’altitude.
Cette source de la rivière est située à 11,8 km au Sud-Est de la confluence de la rivière Rivière du Hibou avec le lac Parent (Abitibi); à 25,2 km au Nord-Est du centre-ville de Senneterre (ville); et à 22,4 km au Sud de l’embouchure du lac Parent (Abitibi).
Les principaux versants hydrographiques voisins du rivière Rivière du Hibou sont:
côté Nord: rivière Bell, lac Parent (Abitibi);
côté Est: ruisseau Signay, rivière Delestres, rivière Collin (rivière Mégiscane);
côté Sud: rivière Mégiscane, ruisseau Jacques, rivière Brassier;
côté Ouest: rivière Brassier, rivière Bell, lac Parent (Abitibi).
À partir de sa source, la rivière Rivière du Hibou coule sur 16,1 km en serpentant entre quelques zones de marais.
Cette confluence de la rivière Rivière du Hibou avec le lac Parent (Abitibi) est située au fond de la Baie du Hibou ((altitude: 301 m) laquelle est formée entre la rive Est du lac Parent (Abitibi) et une presqu’île qui s’étend sur 7,5 km vers le Nord en étant rattachée à la rive Est. Le lac Parent (Abitibi) se déverse dans la rivière Bell, un affluent du lac Matagami. Ce dernier lac se déverse à son tour dans la rivière Nottaway, un affluent de la rive Sud-Est de la Baie James.
Plus précisément, la rivière Rivière du Hibou se déverse à:
10,6 km au Sud-Est de l’embouchure du lac Parent (Abitibi);
19,6 km au Nord-Est de la confluence de la rivière Mégiscane avec le lac Parent (Abitibi);
47,0 km au Sud-Est du centre du village de Lebel-sur-Quévillon;
32,0 km au Nord-Est du centre du village de Senneterre (ville).


== Toponymie ==
Cet hydronyme figure sur une carte datée de 1932.
Le toponyme « rivière Rivière du Hibou » a été officialisé le 5 décembre 1968 à la Commission de toponymie du Québec, lors de sa création.

636,"Ashford v Thornton est une affaire judiciaire, jugée devant la Cour du banc du Roi anglaise, qui, dans le cadre de l'appel d'un jugement d'acquittement pour meurtre, a confirmé le droit d'un accusé à bénéficier d'un duel judiciaire.
En 1817, Abraham Thornton est accusé du meurtre de Mary Ashford. Thornton l'avait rencontrée à une soirée de danse puis l'avait raccompagnée. Le lendemain matin, Mary Ashford avait été retrouvée noyée dans une fosse, avec peu de signes extérieurs de violence. Bien que l'opinion publique ait été fortement hostile à Thornton, le jury le disculpa rapidement de l'accusation de meurtre et de viol.
Le frère de Mary, William Ashford, fit appel du jugement et Thornton fut de nouveau arrêté. Il revendiqua le droit à un duel judiciaire, une coutume médiévale jamais abrogée par le Parlement. Ashford fit valoir que les éléments de preuve à l'encontre de Thornton étaient écrasants et que le duel n'était donc pas admissible.
La cour décida que les preuves contre Thornton n'étaient pas vraiment incontestables et que, par conséquent, le duel judiciaire était une option permise par la loi ; Thornton bénéficia ainsi de la faculté d'y recourir. Ashford déclina l'offre de duel et Thornton fut libéré. Les appels tels que celui formulé par Ashford furent abolis par une loi en 1819 et, avec eux, le droit au duel judiciaire. Thornton émigra aux États-Unis, où il mourut vers 1860.


== Contexte ==


=== Juridique ===

Le duel judiciaire a été introduit en Grande-Bretagne par les Normands, il ne figurait pas dans la loi saxonne. Il était autorisé dans le cas d'un appel d'un acquittement pour meurtre, sous forme d'une « poursuite privée » équivalente à la citation directe du droit français. Si la partie civile — dans les affaires de meurtre, le plus proche parent du défunt — faisait la demande d'un nouveau procès, le défendeur pouvait réagir en exigeant un duel judiciaire, l'accusateur étant tenu de régler la question par le combat, avec un résultat dicté par Dieu. Un tel appel et un tel duel judiciaire pouvaient également avoir lieu à la suite d'un acquittement pour trahison ou pour d'autres crimes. Les appels des jugements pour meurtre étaient rares, devaient être intentés dans un délai d'un an et un jour après la mort de la victime, et étaient généralement jugés par un jury. En 1815, trois ans avant Ashford v Thornton, un appel d'un jugement pour meurtre avait été interjeté à Dublin dans l'affaire O'Reilly v Clancy, et le défendeur avait exigé le duel judiciaire. Le juge en chef, William Downes (plus tard Lord Downes), face à cette affaire, avait demandé :

« Est-il vraiment pensable que ce « pari sur une bataille » puisse être vraiment mis en avant ? Faut-il comprendre qu'avec cette monstrueuse proposition demandée par la barre, nous, juges de la Cour du banc du Roi, gardiens reconnus de la paix publique, deviendrions non seulement spectateurs, mais complices d'un combat à mort ? Est-ce cela que vous requérez de nous , ? »

Le combat n'eut pas lieu, Clancy accepta de plaider coupable et fut déporté à vie.
La date du dernier duel judiciaire en Grande-Bretagne est incertaine. Certaines références parlent d'un tel procès en 1631, mentionnant que le roi Charles Ier était intervenu pour l'empêcher. En 1638, un cas est moins clair ; le roi était encore intervenu et les juges retardèrent la procédure. Aucun dossier n’existe sur cette affaire, mais des récits contemporains parlent effectivement de procès par combat. Le dernier duel judiciaire réellement attesté date de 1597, en Écosse, lorsque Adam Bruntfield accusa James Carmichael de meurtre, et le tua à l'occasion du duel. Le dernier, en Angleterre, s'était produit en 1446 ; un serviteur avait accusé son maître de trahison. Le maître but beaucoup de vin avant la bataille et fut tué par le serviteur.
Le duel judiciaire n'était pas toujours possible pour le défendeur en appel. Si le défendeur avait été pris « la main dans le sac » (en flagrant délit), ou s'il avait essayé de s'évader de prison, ou s'il y avait de telles preuves qu'il n'était pas possible qu'il se défende, il ne pouvait pas contester et invoquer le duel. De même, si le défenseur était une femme, une personne âgée de plus de soixante ans, un mineur, un boiteux ou un aveugle, il ou elle pouvait refuser la confrontation et l'affaire était jugée par un jury. Les pairs du royaume, les prêtres et les citoyens de la ville de Londres pouvaient également refuser la bataille. Si celle-ci avait lieu, elle se déroulait dans une lice judiciaire de 60 pieds carrés (env. 5,5 m2), après que les participants avaient prêté serment de ne pas user de sorcellerie. Si le défendeur était vaincu, et s'il était encore vivant, il devait être pendu sur place ; même le roi ne pouvait le grâcier car on considérait qu'il s'agissait d'un jugement divin. Réciproquement, s'il battait son adversaire, ou s'il était en mesure de le repousser durant la période comprise entre le lever et le coucher du soleil, il était libre. Si le demandeur prononçait le mot craven (« je suis vaincu »), et renonçait à la lutte, il était déclaré « infâme », privé de ses privilèges d'homme libre, et rendu redevable de dommages à son adversaire victorieux.
Des propositions de suppression du duel judiciaire furent introduites durant le xviie siècle et par deux fois au xviiie siècle, mais en vain. En 1774, dans le cadre de la réponse législative à la Boston Tea Party, le Parlement examina un projet de loi visant à abolir les appels des jugement de meurtre et les duels judiciaires dans les colonies américaines. Le député John Dunning s'y opposa, appelant l'appel du jugement pour meurtre « ce grand pilier de la Constitution. » L'écrivain et député Edmund Burke, quant à lui, soutint l'abolition, qualifiant cela « de superstitieux et barbare au dernier degré. »


=== La mort de Mary Ashford ===
Mary Ashford, une jeune femme d'environ 20 ans, travaillait comme domestique et bonne à tout faire pour son oncle, un agriculteur de Langley Heath, Warwickshire, entre Birmingham et Sutton Coldfield. Son père était jardinier près d'Erdington. Elle travailla comme d'habitude, le 26 mai 1817, et avait prévu d'assister à une soirée aux Trois Cuves, un pub appelé la Maison Tyburn. La soirée était une réunion annuelle festive, consacrée à la danse, attirant un public nombreux. Elle rencontra son amie, Hannah Cox, quitta ses vêtements de travail chez les Cox, dans leur maison d'Erdington, après avoir pris de quoi se changer dans la maison de sa mère, située dans le même village. Elle se rendit à la Maison Tyburn, arrivant à 19 h 30, alors que les danses avaient déjà commencé.
Dans l'assemblée figurait Abraham Thornton, le fils d'un entrepreneur de Castle Bromwich. Il avait environ 24 ans et était massif ; les descriptions le concernant vont de « beau jeune homme » à « d'aspect repoussant ». Quand il vit Mary Ashford, il demanda à une autre personne qui elle était. Cette personne allégua que Thornton aurait déclaré qu'il avait eu par trois fois des relations intimes avec la sœur de Mary, et qu'il en serait de même avec elle ou, sinon, qu'il mourrait pour elle. Thornton nia cette déclaration, qui fut une source majeure de l'animosité du public à son encontre lorsqu'il fut arrêté. Au cours de la soirée, il fut très empressé auprès de Mary Ashford, laquelle semblait apprécier sa compagnie.

Vers vingt-trois heures, Hannah Cox exhorta Mary Ashford à quitter la fête. Les deux femmes partirent avec Thornton, qui accompagnait Mary Ashford de près, tandis qu'Hannah Cox marchait derrière eux. Au lieu de revenir à Erdington, Mary annonça qu'elle allait chez son grand-père, précisant que c'était se rapprocher de son lieu de travail. C'était vrai, mais cela négligeait le fait qu'elle aurait à retourner à Erdington dans la matinée pour récupérer ses vêtements de travail. Hannah Cox se rendit à Erdington, tandis que Mary Ashford et Abraham Thornton allaient de concert. À environ trois heures et quart, un ouvrier vit Thornton quitter la maison d'un ami avec une femme ; il salua Thornton, mais la femme (sans doute Mary Ashford) tenait son chapeau devant son visage. Juste avant quatre heures du matin, Hannah Cox fut réveillée par Mary Ashford qui venait chercher ses vêtements de travail. Elle se changea rapidement, précisant qu'elle devait être à son travail avant que son oncle ne parte pour le marché. Un fêtard de retour de la Maison Tyburn la vit marcher rapidement. Il fut la dernière personne à la voir en vie.
Vers six heures du matin, un passant vit des objets féminins près d'une fosse remplie d'eau, dont une chaussure de femme ensanglantée. Il donna l'alarme. Avec d'autres, il utilisa un râteau et trouva un corps dans la fosse, celui de Mary Ashford. Deux ouvriers d'une usine voisine trouvèrent une série d'empreintes de pas dans le champ fraichement labouré près de la fosse, montrant qu'un homme et une femme avaient marché ensemble, presque jusqu'à la fosse, et que l'homme était reparti seul. Mary Ashford était connue de beaucoup de ceux qui se trouvaient près de la fosse, tout comme était connu le fait qu'elle était allée à Tyburn le soir précédent. Le propriétaire de l'usine locale, qui avait pris les choses en main, se rendit à Tyburn pour découvrir avec qui Mary Ashford avait quitté la fête. Daniel Clarke, propriétaire terrien, se dirigea en direction de Castle Bromwich pour tenter de localiser Thornton et il le rencontra presque aussitôt. Lorsque Clarke dit à Thornton que Mary Ashford était morte, Thornton déclara qu'il avait été avec elle jusqu'à quatre heures du matin ; à la demande de Clarke, ils se rendirent tous deux à Tyburn.
Thomas Dales, un adjoint de police, arriva de Birmingham. Après examen de la situation, il interrogea Thornton, qu'il arrêta. Dales ne gardait cependant aucune note et, plus tard, il s’avéra incapable de se souvenir de ce que le prisonnier lui avait dit. Thornton fut ensuite interrogé par le magistrat local, William Bedford, qui ordonna une fouille de Thornton ; elle révéla qu'il portait des sous-vêtements tachés de sang, et il admit avoir eu des rapports sexuels avec Ashford, la nuit précédente. Les chaussures du prisonnier lui furent confisquées et des comparaisons avec les empreintes de pas trouvées par les ouvriers de l'usine furent réalisées ; ces derniers témoignèrent, lors du procès, qu'elles correspondaient. Un examen post-mortem révéla que Mary Ashford était morte noyée, et que les seules marques sur son corps étaient deux lacérations dans la région génitale. L'examen conclut que, jusqu'à l'acte sexuel qui avait causé le saignement, Ashford était vierge. Elle était menstruée au moment de sa mort.


== Procès ==
Une enquête se tint le 30 mai 1817, présidée par Francis Hackett, magistrat du Warwickshire, coroner de Sutton Coldfield. Thornton, en garde à vue, y assista et fut autorisé à interroger les témoins par l'intermédiaire de son avocat. À la fin de la procédure, un verdict d'« homicide volontaire » fut prononcé, et Thornton déféré pour un procès à la prochaine séance de la cour d'assises de Warwick. Il fut emprisonné à la prison du comté en attendant le procès.

L'opinion publique locale fut fortement hostile à Thornton. Des brochures furent vendues, censées montrer sa culpabilité, et des poèmes furent composés sur le même thème. L'avocat du défendeur s’en plaignit, arguant qu'il serait difficile de réunir un jury impartial. Le 8 août 1817, une foule remplit la rue en face de la mairie du comté de Warwick, où le procès devait avoir lieu. Lorsque le juge ouvrit la procédure, à huit heures du matin, les gens se précipitèrent sur les places disponibles, et les bancs publics restèrent pleins tout au long de la journée du procès. En raison de la nature de la preuve, les femmes ne furent pas autorisées à y assister.
La thèse de l'accusation, exposée dans sa déclaration liminaire au jury lors de l'ouverture du procès, était que Thornton, après avoir échoué dans sa tentative de séduire Mary Ashford, l'avait attendue dans le champ près de la fosse. Il savait qu'elle aurait à passer par là à son retour d'Erdington. Le voyant, elle essaya de lui échapper, mais il l'attrapa et l'obligea à l'accompagner dans le champ proche. Là, il la jeta au sol et abusa d'elle. L'autopsie avait montré qu'elle n'avait pas mangé depuis vingt-quatre heures et, selon l'avocat général, elle n'avait pas pu lui résister et s’était s'évanouie. Craignant les conséquences s'il avait été pris avec une femme inconsciente traitée de cette manière, Thornton l'aurait jetée dans la fosse, où elle se noya. À ce moment, l'avocat de la défense ne fut pas autorisé à s’adresser au jury, et le sujet fut traité par la suite.
Un certain nombre de témoins, dont Hannah Cox, relatèrent les événements de la soirée du 26 mai et du lendemain matin. Les premiers témoins à subir un contre-interrogatoire par William Lecteur, l'avocat de Thornton, furent les deux ouvriers d'usine, William Lavell et Joseph Bird, qui avaient reconnu la similarité entre les chaussures de Thornton et les empreintes de pas dans le champ hersé. Durant ce contre-interrogatoire, les deux concédèrent qu'il avait plu abondamment entre le moment où les empreintes avaient été faites et le moment où ils tentèrent de les faire correspondre avec les empreintes des semelles. Le gendarme Dales dit au jury que Thornton avait admis avoir eu des relations sexuelles avec Mary Ashford avant d'être fouillé, c'est-à-dire avant qu'on révèle qu'il portait des vêtements maculés de sang. M. Freer, chirurgien de Birmingham qui avait effectué l'autopsie, témoigna de ses constatations, et déclara que, à l'exception des lacérations vaginales, il n'y avait aucune trace de violence sur la personne de Mary Ashford, et que ces coupures pouvaient avoir été causées par des relations sexuelles consenties. Le témoignage du médecin termina la séquence accusatoire et, le défendeur ayant renoncé à exercer son droit de s’adresser à la cour, la défense fit appeler des témoins.
Grâce à onze témoins, la défense établit un alibi pour Thornton. William Jennings (dans certaines sources Jennans) témoigna qu'il avait vu Thornton à quatre heures et demie du matin, marchant tranquillement vers la ferme de John Holden, où Jennings était allé acheter du lait. La ferme Holden se situait à 3,6 ou 4 km de la fosse, selon le chemin emprunté. Vers quatre heures cinquante, Thornton fut vu à Castle Bromwich par un garde-chasse, John Heydon. Thornton dit à Heydon qu'il avait passé une bonne partie de la nuit avec une femme et, après avoir passé une quinzaine de minutes à discuter, s'en alla vers la maison de son père. La défense soutint donc que, si Thornton avait tué Mary Ashford, il aurait dû la pourchasser, la violer, la tuer, puis accomplir un trajet de près de cinq kilomètres, le tout en l'espace de onze minutes.
Les témoignages durèrent une dizaine d'heures, durée pendant laquelle la cour siéga en permanence. Après une courte pause, George Holroyd, juge à la Cour du banc du Roi, commença son résumé, prenant deux heures pour s'adresser au jury. Il l'exhorta à évacuer le préjugé quant aux relations sexuelles de Thornton avec Mary Ashford ; ils étaient là pour déterminer s'il était coupable de l'infraction reprochée. Il souligna devant le jury l'absence de dissimulation de Thornton, qui avait admis l'acte sexuel, ainsi que d'être resté avec Mary jusqu'à quatre heures du matin. Il dit qu'il n'était pas possible que Thornton ait commis les actes allégués par l'accusation, qu'il n'aurait pas eu le temps d'arriver à la ferme Holden où il avait été vu par Heydon, tout en soulignant que Thornton ne semblait pas avoir couru. Le juge conclut en rappelant au jury qu'il valait mieux un meurtrier en liberté qu'un innocent en prison. Le jury ne se retira pas pour délibérer et, après une concertation de six minutes, déclara Thornton non coupable. Il fut ensuite interrogé sur l'incrimination de viol. L'accusation informa la cour qu'elle n'avait aucune preuve à fournir, et le juge Holroyd demanda au jury de déclarer l'accusé non coupable de viol, ce qu'il fit. Thornton fut donc libéré.


== Appel ==
L'acquittement de Thornton fut accueilli avec indignation dans le Warwickshire, et même dans tout le pays. Les journaux publièrent des lettres et des commentaires très hostiles à l'égard de Thornton. Les principaux artisans de cette campagne furent le Lichfield Mercure et l'Indépendants Whig, mais même The Times exprima sa joie quand il apprit que l'affaire serait relancée. Des fonds furent recueillis auprès de contributeurs, et un avocat local s'appuya sur le frère de Mary, William Ashford, pour interjeter appel du jugement. William Ashford fut décrit comme « un jeune et simple campagnard, de petite taille, aux cheveux clairs et aux yeux bleus ». L'acte d'appel fut publié le 1er octobre 1817 et Thornton arrêté sur la foi d'un mandat délivré à la suite. L'appel devant être jugé devant la Cour du banc du Roi à Londres, Thornton fut envoyé dans cette ville le 28 octobre. Les partisans de la famille Ashford firent de leur mieux pour trouver des preuves visant à remettre en question l'alibi de Thornton, sans beaucoup de succès. Le 6 novembre, l'affaire arriva devant la Cour, mais fut rapidement ajournée jusqu'au 17, lorsque l'avocat de la défense indiqua qu'il avait besoin de plus de temps pour conseiller son client quant à son plaidoyer. L'audience de comparution initiale fut peu fréquentée, apparemment parce que le public n'avait pas réalisé que le tristement célèbre Thornton serait là en personne.
Le magistrat local du Warwickshire, William Bedford, se trouvait désormais dans le rôle de l'avocat de William Ashford. Au début, il n'eut pas de raison de s'inquiéter. Cependant, le 11 novembre, il écrivit à son greffier :

« Je suis désolé de dire que des difficultés se font jour, susceptibles de causer des ennuis, voire d'occasionner finalement la défaite. Il semblerait que le défendeur [Abraham Thornton] ait la possibilité d'invoquer le duel judiciaire et d'affronter l'appelant [William Ashford] en combat singulier ce qui, si ce n'est pas accepté par l'appelant, fait que l'appel est perdu, et, si c'est accepté et que le défendeur peut soutenir le combat entre le lever et le coucher du soleil, fait que ce dernier gagne le procès et est innocenté, quoique, sinon, il soit condamné à l'infamie et à la peine de mort sur le champ de bataille. On dit ici que c'est l'intention de la défense que de plaider cela et, à moins que nous ne puissions convaincre la cour de ne pas accepter l'argument, j'ai peur que notre pauvre petit chevalier ne puisse pas lutter contre son brutal adversaire,. »

Lorsque le cas en vint à être entendu devant la Cour du banc du Roi, le 17 novembre, une foule immense emplit Westminster Hall, à tel point que l'avocat eut beaucoup de difficulté à entrer. Lorsqu'il fut interrogé sur son plaidoyer, Thornton déclara « Non coupable, et je suis prêt à défendre la même chose avec mon corps. » Il enfila alors un gantelet de cuir tendu par son avocat et jeta l’autre devant William Ashford afin qu’il le ramasse et accepte ainsi le défi, ce qu'Ashford ne fit pas. Au lieu de cela, son avocat, Nathaniel Clarke, fit valoir que Thornton ne pouvait pas être en mesure d'ajouter au meurtre de la sœur une tentative d'assassinat du frère. À cela, le juge en Chef, Lord Ellenborough répondit, « c'est la loi de l'Angleterre, M. Clarke ; nous ne devons pas l'appeler meurtre. » Clarke fit ensuite valoir la jeunesse et le manque de force physique de William Ashton comme raisons de ne pas accorder la possibilité du combat. Son opposant, en réponse, déclara que l'avocat ne devrait pas gaspiller le temps du Tribunal en faisant valoir que le procès par combat n'était pas sage en raison de la condition physique de son client, mais qu'il devrait plaider en réponse afin de faire avancer le dossier. Il nota également que lui et ses co-avocats avaient conseillé à Thornton le duel judiciaire car, du fait de « l'extraordinaire et sans précédent préjudice » à l'encontre du défendeur, un jury impartial n'aurait pu être réuni. L'affaire fut reportée au 22 novembre pour permettre à l'avocat d'Ashford de déposer ses plaidoiries.
Lors des audiences ultérieures, chaque partie fit des déclarations sous serment quant à sa version de l'affaire. Ashford demanda à la Cour de statuer sur le fait que les éléments de preuve à l'encontre de Thornton étaient accablants et que le défendeur n'était donc pas admissible à demander le duel judiciaire. Thornton réclama le contraire. Une grande partie de l'affaire fut débattue entre le 6 et le 8 février 1818, mais l'un des conseils d'Ashford, Joseph Chitty, demanda et obtint plus de temps pour répondre aux arguments de l’autre partie, et l'affaire fut ajournée jusqu'au 16 avril. Chitty plaida alors, mais il fut si souvent interrompu par les juges que, lorsqu'il s'assit, selon Sir John Hall dans son livre sur l'affaire, « il était clair pour tout le monde dans la Cour que son client avait perdu. »
Les juges conférèrent durant environ un quart d'heure, puis l'arrêt fut prononcé seriatim (en), les juges parlant l'un après l'autre. Tous les quatre se prononcèrent pour Thornton, estimant que les preuves contre lui n'était pas si fortes qu'il ne puisse invoquer son droit au duel judiciaire. Lord Ellenborough déclara :

« La discussion qui a eu lieu ici, et la considération qui a été donnée aux faits allégués, montrent de manière concluante que le cas n'est pas susceptible de n’admettre aucun déni ni aucune preuve contraire ; dans ces conditions, si désagréable que puisse m'être personnellement le duel judiciaire, c'est un mode de procès que nous sommes tenus, eu égard à son caractère judiciaire, d'accorder. Nous respectons la loi comme elle est, et non pas comme nous la voulons, et nous devons donc prononcer notre jugement, qui est que le combat doit avoir lieu,. »

Après que les autres juges eurent remis leur jugement, Lord Ellenborough conclut :

« La loi de ce pays est en faveur du duel judiciaire, et il est de notre devoir de prononcer la loi comme elle est, et pas comme nous le voudrions. Quels que soient les préjugés qui peuvent exister à l'encontre de ce mode de procès, dans la mesure où c'est la loi du pays, le tribunal doit en prononcer le jugement,. »

Lord Ellenborough indiqua cependant qu'Ashford pouvait demander que Thornton soit autorisé à être libéré sans devoir passer à nouveau devant la cour. L'affaire fut ajournée jusqu'au 20 avril pour qu'Ashford puisse examiner ses options, la libération de Thornton ou la confrontation sous forme de duel. Le 20 avril, l'avocat d'Ashford indiqua qu'il n’avait pas d'objection à la libération de Thornton, tant qu'aucune mesure ne serait prise à l'encontre de son client. Ayant été rassuré sur ce point, l'appel fut rejeté. Thornton fut ensuite accusé de meurtre proforma, avec un plaidoyer indiquant qu'il avait été précédemment acquitté. Le plaidoyer étant accepté, l'affaire était terminée, et Thornton fut libéré. Il y avait une foule en colère à l'extérieur, et Thornton, sur l'invitation de Lord Ellenborough, sortit par une porte latérale.


== Conséquences ==
En juin 1819, Lord Eldon, lord grand chancelier, présenta un projet de loi visant à abolir les appels privés des acquittements, ainsi que les duels judiciaires. La loi fut adoptée très rapidement, l'ensemble des trois lectures obligatoires du projet de loi à la Chambre des lords se déroulant en une seule nuit. Selon Sir Robert Megarry, auteur de Ashford v Thornton en 2005, cette rapidité était due à un duel judiciaire dans un autre cas, bien que les noms des parties ne soient pas connus. La loi stipulait que « les appels des procès pour meurtre, trahison, crime et autres infractions, ainsi que la façon de procéder qui va avec, ont été considérés comme oppressifs ; et le duel judiciaire, dans quelque poursuite judiciaire que ce soit, est un mode de procès impropre et il est opportun que la chose soit entièrement abolie. » La loi abolit donc les appels des procès pour meurtre et autres infractions.
Abraham Thornton retourna à Castle Bromwich, mais le dégoût général qu'il inspirait lui était insupportable. Il réserva une place à destination de New York à bord de l'Independence, mais, quand ses compagnons de voyage découvrirent qui il était, ils insistèrent pour qu'il soit déposé à terre. Le 30 septembre 1818, Abraham Thornton effectua le trajet de Liverpool à New York à bord du Shamrock. Aux États-Unis, il travailla comme maçon, se maria et eut des enfants. Il mourut vers 1860 à Baltimore. William Ashford, qui travailla de nombreuses années comme poissonnier à Birmingham, fut trouvé mort dans son lit en janvier 1867, à l'âge de soixante-dix ans. Selon Walter Thornbury, qui écrivit sur l'affaire à la fin du xixe siècle : « quant aux causes de la mort de Mary Ashford, seul le jour du jugement dernier peut maintenant les révéler. »
Les universitaires ont fait valoir que Ashford v Thornton avait inspiré le combat judiciaire qui forme le point culminant du roman de Sir Walter Scott, Ivanhoé,. Une tentative de recours au duel judiciaire fut introduite en 1985 en Écosse par deux frères, accusés de vol à main armée, au motif que la suppression ne s'appliquait pas à l'Écosse. La demande fut rejetée, les prévenus n'ayant pu fournir la preuve que les lois concernées ne s'appliquaient pas à l'ensemble du Royaume-Uni. En 2002, un homme de soixante ans, redevable d'une amende de 25 £ pour une infraction mineure au code de la route, exigea un duel judiciaire contre un champion qui aurait été désigné par la Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Il avait déclaré que le duel judiciaire était encore valide en vertu de la législation européenne sur les droits de l'homme. Les magistrats le condamnèrent à une amende de 200 £, plus 100 £ de frais.

638,"Gérard Filoche, né le 22 décembre 1945 à Rouen, est un syndicaliste et homme politique français.
Inspecteur du travail de profession, il a publié de nombreux ouvrages sur mai 68 et sur le droit du travail et contribue à différents médias (L'Humanité, Mediapart, etc).
Militant communiste dans sa jeunesse, il est ensuite trotskiste (LC, puis LCR), jusqu'à son adhésion au Parti socialiste en septembre 1994. Il est également cofondateur de SOS Racisme.
Il est l'un des animateurs de l'aile gauche du PS et fait partie de son bureau politique, sans jamais obtenir cependant de mandat électif. En novembre 2017, il est exclu du PS en raison d'un tweet jugé antisémite.


== Biographie ==


=== Famille ===
Gérard Filoche est le fils unique de René Filoche (1911-1978), cheminot menuisier-chaudronnier au dépôt Rouen-Orléans, membre de la CGT, qui fut prisonnier déporté quatre ans en Allemagne pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et d'Antoinette Filoche (1913-2000), aide-soignante dans une clinique privée de Rouen,. Son grand-père maternel fut tué à Verdun pendant la Première Guerre mondiale.
Il s'est marié le 4 mai 1971 avec Françoise Le Toullec (née en 1942), conseillère de Paris (PS) du 1er arrondissement, fille de Marcel Le Toullec, cheminot, militant au PCF, ancien combattant de 1914-1918 et résistant. De ce mariage naîtront trois enfants :
Léa Filoche (née en 1978), conseillère de Paris (PS) et adjointe au maire du 19e arrondissement.
Emma Filoche (née en 1979).
Germain Filoche (né en 1983), professeur.
Il est, avec Sybille Fasso, le père de Louise Fasso-Monaldi (née en 1985),,,.
Il sera ensuite, avec Françoise Rambaud, le père de Louis, Marie et Luc.


=== Études ===
Gérard Filoche fait ses études secondaires au lycée Fontenelle à Rouen puis au lycée des Bruyères à Sotteville-lès-Rouen de 1962 à 1963 où il obtient un baccalauréat en philosophie,. Il est ensuite étudiant à l'université de Rouen où il obtient une licence et un certificat de maîtrise de philosophie en 1968.


=== Activités professionnelles ===
Il fut successivement à partir de 1962, moniteur de colonie, facteur, conducteur de train, manutentionnaire, chauffeur-livreur, maître-auxiliaire, enseignant de philosophie (de 1964 à 1965 au lycée des Bruyères à Rouen), journaliste, un des dirigeants du quotidien Rouge (du 15 mars 1975 au 29 janvier 1979), ouvrier du livre (de 1975 au 29 janvier 1979), puis contrôleur du travail à la formation professionnelle (de 1982 à 1985). Nommé inspecteur du travail pour ses 40 ans en 1985, il exerce ses fonctions d'abord dans l'agriculture en Champagne-Ardenne (de 1987 à 1989), ensuite dans le 3e arrondissement de Paris (de mars 1989 à avril 2003) et enfin dans le 2e arrondissement de Paris (d'avril 2003 jusqu'à sa retraite le 23 décembre 2010).


=== Inspecteur du travail ===
Il est également connu de par sa profession d'inspecteur du travail. Cette activité lui a valu d'être nommé personnalité qualifiée de 1999 à 2001 au Conseil économique et social par Lionel Jospin, où il fit adopter un avis sur les 20 ans de CHSCT.
Il a collaboré à un documentaire de 70 minutes de Richard Bois, La dernière digue, l'inspection du travail, diffusé sur France 2 le 2 avril 2000. Il est à l'origine de l'idée et a collaboré au téléfilm Simon le juste, avec Dan Franck et Gérard Mordillat, diffusé sur France 2 le 29 janvier 2003.
En 2007, il est menacé d’être mis en examen par le juge Yves Madre pour avoir menacé dans son activité professionnelle régulière un employeur de lui dresser un procès-verbal : le patron porte plainte pour « chantage ». Le juge interroge Gérard Filoche (en présence de son avocat) pendant cinq heures au Palais de justice de Paris, le 9 mars 2007, et renonce, finalement, à le mettre en examen.
De 2006 à 2008, il est l'un des principaux opposants à la recodification du Code du travail, dont il critique des changements défavorables aux salariés.
À la fin de l'année 2009, Gérard Filoche est mis en examen puis renvoyé en correctionnelle pour chantage puis entrave au fonctionnement du comité d'entreprise de Guinot - Mary Cohr à l'été 2004. Lors de la séance du comité d'entreprise statuant sur le licenciement d'une déléguée syndicale CGT, Gérard Filoche aurait imposé sa présence et exercé des pressions sur les membres du comité d'entreprise. En fait le CE était « bidon », composé d'un seul membre au service de l'employeur. Une pétition de soutien à Gérard Filoche recueillit plus de 42 000 signatures en quelques semaines. Dans cette même affaire, le comité d'entreprise donna un avis indicatif favorable au licenciement de la déléguée syndicale, Gérard Filoche refusa de donner l'autorisation de licenciement, le ministère du Travail cassa cette décision, puis le tribunal administratif confirma la légitimité de la décision de Gérard Filoche contre l'avis du directeur général du travail, Jean-Denis Combrexelle. Le 12 octobre 2011, il est relaxé en première instance par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris. L'institut de beauté ayant fait appel du jugement, le 3 juillet 2012 la Cour d’appel du TGI de Paris, après huit ans de procédures, juge irrecevable la plainte attribuée au CE Guinot,. L'administration, qui la lui avait refusée, finit par lui accorder la « protection fonctionnelle » dans cette affaire le 26 juillet 2012.
Au premier semestre 2013, il s'oppose à l'ANI (Accord National Interprofessionnel du 11 janvier 2013) avant que celui-ci ne devienne la loi du 14 juin 2013. Puis il refait campagne en défense du droit à la retraite à 60 ans sans décote sous le slogan « pas un trimestre de plus, pas un euro de moins ».


=== Militant communiste, trotskiste et syndical ===
D'origine ouvrière (père cheminot menuisier-chaudronnier à la SNCF et mère aide-soignante), il fait des études de philosophie à l'université de Rouen et adhère à l'Union nationale des étudiants de France (UNEF). Il adhère à la Confédération générale du travail (CGT) en 1963. Il devient membre de l'Union des étudiants communistes (UEC) et du Parti communiste français (PCF) ; il en est exclu en 1966. Il anime le Comité Vietnam de Rouen, cofonde la Jeunesse communiste révolutionnaire (JCR, trotskiste) et participe à mai 68 en tant que dirigeant du comité de grève des étudiants de Rouen. Il devient président de l'Association générale des étudiants rouennais-UNEF. Il anime une puissante section de la Ligue communiste à Rouen après 1968.
Il participe à la fondation de la Ligue communiste en 1969, puis de la Ligue communiste révolutionnaire (LCR) en 1974, et siège 25 ans au bureau politique de ces deux mouvements successifs. Sa compagne, Françoise Filoche, rencontrée en 1961, qui est à l'origine de son engagement politique, est l'une des premières féministes de la Ligue communiste, organisant un courant révolutionnaire au début des années 1970 au sein du Mouvement de libération des femmes (MLF).
Après la dissolution de la Ligue communiste en 1973 et la constitution de la LCR un an plus tard, Gérard Filoche obtient que soit accepté le droit à une tendance au sein de la LCR et participe à la création de la tendance T1 (20 % des voix au congrès de 1975) ; elle se renouvellera au congrès de 1976. Elle se différenciera sur l'analyse de la révolution portugaise de 1975-1976. Elle se distinguera en défendant un « travail de masse », un « front unique » et un « gouvernement PS-PC » (syndicat étudiant, syndicat lycéen, syndicat de soldats, unité des syndicats de salariés). Elle représente l'opposition à la T2, majoritaire, d'Alain Krivine, Daniel Bensaïd et Henri Weber. Il ne s'alliera avec Alain Krivine qu'en 1978, alors que la LCR ferme le quotidien Rouge et effectue un plan social de licenciement, dont Gérard Filoche est chargé. Devenu majoritaire en 1979, il ne pourra empêcher la scission d'une aile de son ancienne tendance avec Daniel Gluckstein, qui se rallie au lambertisme au congrès de L'Haÿ-les-Roses en novembre 1979.
Il est membre du Secrétariat unifié de la Quatrième internationale de 1979 à 1994. Il participe ou anime à plusieurs reprises des tendances internationales lors des congrès mondiaux.
En 1984, il confonde SOS Racisme avec Julien Dray et Harlem Désir.
Il anime la minorité « unitaire » de la LCR tout au long des années 1980, avant de créer « Vent d'Est » puis « Démocratie & Socialisme » (D&S) lorsque survient la chute du mur de Berlin et le refus de la LCR de voter à gauche au scrutin de 1993. Sa tendance, après un stage collectif de réflexion à Revel en juillet 1994, rejoint le Parti socialiste.


=== Militant de la gauche du Parti socialiste ===
Début 1994, il lance avec D&S (et les syndicalistes de renom Raymond Vacheron, Eric Thouzeau, René Defroment, Jean Yves Lalanne, Jean-Claude Branchereau, etc) une campagne pour « les 35 heures sans perte de salaires ». Il rejoint en septembre 1994 le Parti socialiste avec 150 autres militants, et intègre immédiatement son Conseil national. Il est un fervent défenseur de l'union de toute la gauche.
En 1999, le Medef de Seine-et-Marne lui fait procès au motif qu'il a dit sur France Bleu Melun que « les patrons trichaient avec les 35 heures » et parce qu'il « démoralise les chefs d'entreprise » ; il gagne ce procès, et le Medef de Seine-et-Marne est condamné à lui verser 10 000 francs pour abus du droit d'ester en justice. En 2001, Denis Kessler, vice-président du Medef, lui fait procès, parce que la revue Démocratie et Socialisme en « une » lui a attribué le titre d'« ennemi public n°1 » ; Gérard Filoche gagne le procès, et le Medef est condamné à lui verser 40 000 francs pour abus du droit d'ester en justice.
De 2000 à 2005, il est membre du Bureau national du Parti socialiste. D&S fusionne en 1995 avec la Gauche socialiste (GS) ; il essaie d'empêcher son éclatement à l'été 2002, faisant adopter à l'unanimité les « thèses de Nantes », mais l'antagonisme de Jean-Luc Mélenchon et de Julien Dray impose la scission malgré cela. Puis il cofonde en 2002, le courant Nouveau Parti socialiste (NPS), alors que le courant D&S se partage entre Nouveau Parti socialiste (de Vincent Peillon, Arnaud Montebourg et Benoît Hamon) et Nouveau Monde (NM, d'Henri Emmanuelli et Jean-Luc Mélenchon).
Il est rédacteur en chef de la revue Démocratie et Socialisme depuis 1992. Cette revue, animée par ses proches, se veut passerelle entre les différentes sensibilités de la gauche du Parti socialiste. Candidat en 45e position (non éligible) sur la liste PS des européennes en 1999, il est évincé des élections municipales de Combs-la-Ville en 2001, alors qu'il est secrétaire de section depuis cinq ans, après quatre votes et à une voix près, et n'a donc jamais eu de mandat électif.
Il mène campagne pour le « Non » au Traité constitutionnel européen, contre la position officielle du Parti socialiste, alors que le courant NPS, qui s'est aussi prononcé pour le « Non », ne mène pas campagne. Il milite pour le rapprochement des courants de gauche du Parti socialiste, notamment lors d'un grand meeting à la halle Georges-Carpentier à Paris le 10 avril 2004, qui rassemble 40 % du PS (NPS, NM, FM et D&S). Il fait le tour de France, 20 régions, en « trio socialiste » avec Marc Dolez et Jacques Généreux, 86 meetings devant 36 000 personnes du 29 mars 2005 au 29 2005, aidant le « Non socialiste » à gagner. Poussé vers la sortie du courant NPS par Vincent Peillon à cause de cette campagne publique, il cofonde en 2005 le courant Alternative socialiste (AS) avec Henri Emmanuelli, Marc Dolez et Jean-Pierre Masseret. Il milite pour une alliance négociée entre AS et NPS pour le congrès du Mans, mais il refuse la synthèse, de même que Marc Dolez. Les deux fusionnent leurs sensibilités dans le courant Forces militantes pour la démocratie et le socialisme (FMD&S). Gérard Filoche refait un tour de France de meetings à l'occasion de la mobilisation victorieuse contre le CPE au printemps 2006, puis contre la « recodification du Code du travail » de 2007 au 1er mai 2008.
Néanmoins, Marc Dolez décide de rompre unilatéralement l'alliance FMD&S après la désignation de Ségolène Royal comme candidate à l'élection présidentielle de 2007. Alors que Gérard Filoche, qui avait milité pour la désignation de Laurent Fabius, choisit de mener la campagne de Ségolène Royal pour battre Nicolas Sarkozy, Marc Dolez refuse de faire campagne pour la candidate désignée.
En juin 2008, il est le premier signataire d'une des vingt et une contributions déposées dans le cadre de la préparation du congrès de Reims du PS. En septembre 2008, il cofonde la motion de gauche Un monde d'avance (UMA) avec Henri Emmanuelli, Marie-Noëlle Lienemann et Benoît Hamon : « Un monde d'avance : reconstruire l'espoir à gauche ». Il anime la campagne nationale autour de l'appel d'ATTAC, de la fondation Copernic, de la FSU, de Solidaires et de la CGT pour le droit à la retraite à 60 ans sans décote et pour tous au cours de l'année 2010. Parmi les premiers, il soutient l'idée de la candidature de Martine Aubry à l'élection présidentielle de 2012.
Au congrès de Toulouse, il présente sa contribution « Redistribuer les richesses d'abord » avec le courant D&S (Jean-Jacques Chavigné (Somme), Gérard Berthiot (vice-président du conseil régional de Champagne-Ardenne), Eric Thouzeau (conseiller régional de Loire-Atlantique), Catherine Touchefeu (adjointe au maire de Nantes), Claude Touchefeu (adjointe au maire de Toulouse), Jean-Yves Lalanne (maire de Billère), Pierre Ruscassie, etc.), puis, actant des divergences stratégiques avec le courant Un monde d'avance de Benoît Hamon, lequel refuse de présenter une motion, il est le numéro 2 de la motion 3 « Maintenant la gauche : le social au cœur » avec Emmanuel Maurel. Il est réélu au Bureau national le 15 novembre 2012.
Il mène campagne pour que le gouvernement de gauche refuse l'« ANI-Medef » du 11 janvier 2013, pour qu'il amnistie les syndicalistes, pour qu'il conduise une politique plus à gauche. Il est placé sous les feux des médias pour un coup de gueule télévisé (le 2 avril 2013 sur LCI) contre la corruption du ministre du budget Jérôme Cahuzac et publie le 13 juin un livre Le choc, après Cahuzac (Jean-Claude Gawsewitch éditeur).
En 2014, il émet des doutes sur la politique sociale des gouvernements de Jean-Marc Ayrault et de Manuel Valls et se demande s'il s'agit vraiment d'une politique d'un gouvernement de gauche. Il s'oppose aux lois sur les retraites, les lois Macron et Rebsamen. Il défend le contrôle des licenciements, la semaine de 32 heures, la hausse du SMIC, la retraite à 60 ans, un salaire maxima à 20 fois le SMIC, une réforme fiscale et bancaire d'envergure. Ces thèmes sont repris en septembre 2014 dans Comment résister à la démolition du code du travail et en mars 2015 dans son 31e livre Vive l'entreprise ?.
Au congrès de Poitiers des 6 et 7 juin 2015, il se prononce « pour une seule grande tendance de tous ceux qui défendent le meilleur de la tradition socialiste en opposition à un gouvernement qui conduit la gauche dans le mur ». Il soutient la motion B, qui obtient 30 % des voix. Gérard Filoche est alors réélu au Bureau national.
En 2016, il s'oppose à la loi El Khomri,, considérant que le projet institue une nouvelle hiérarchie des normes dans le droit du travail en inversant le principe de faveur car le résultat moins favorable d'une négociation collective pourra prévaloir sur la loi.


=== Journalisme ===
Il contribue régulièrement au journaux satiriques Siné Hebdo puis Siné Mensuel, créés par le dessinateur Siné, intervenant principalement sur les questions relatives au Code du travail et aux droits des salariés. Il est également chroniqueur à partir de 2010 à L'Humanité Dimanche et blogueur associé des sites Marianne et Mediapart.


=== Tentative de candidature présidentielle ===
Le 14 juin 2016, lors d'un passage dans l'émission Là-bas si j'y suis, il se déclare candidat à la primaire à gauche pour l'élection présidentielle de 2017 sur un projet qu'il résume par la suite de chiffres « 1800-32-60-20-5 », à savoir : le SMIC à 1 800 € par mois, la semaine de 32 heures, la retraite à 60 ans, aucun salaire supérieur à 20 fois le SMIC et pas plus de 5 % de travailleurs précaires dans l'entreprise.
Le 17 décembre, il est écarté de la primaire, faute d'un nombre de parrainages suffisant. Dès l'annonce de la décision de la Haute autorité du PS, il indique son intention de déposer deux recours, qui seront rejetés.
Le mois suivant, il apporte son soutien à Arnaud Montebourg. Après la défaite de ce dernier au premier tour, il décide de soutenir Benoît Hamon, arrivé en tête devant Manuel Valls et qui remporte finalement la primaire.


== Polémiques ==
Le 21 octobre 2014, à la suite de la mort accidentelle du PDG de Total Christophe de Margerie, Gérard Filoche tweete : « De Margerie est mort. Famille Taittinger en deuil. Les grands féodaux sont touchés. Ils sont fragiles. Le successeur nous volera t-il moins ? ». Dans un tweet suivant, il qualifie l'homme d'affaires de « suceur de sang ». Ses messages déclenchent l'ire d'une partie de la classe politique de droite mais aussi de gauche, certains, comme Patrick Mennucci ou Manuel Valls, demandant même son exclusion du PS. Saisie, la Haute autorité du PS finit par abandonner toute suite en décembre 2016.
Gérard Filoche se signale par son opposition à Emmanuel Macron lors du passage de ce dernier au ministère de l'Économie. En septembre 2015, il lance un site internet pour réclamer la démission du ministre. Le mois suivant, suite à un accident de car ayant coûté la vie à 43 personnes, Gérard Filoche reprend les propos de Noël Mamère qui attribue ce drame aux risques pour les passagers qu'induirait la loi Macron. Il en profite pour faire au passage la promotion de son site. Le député PS Jean-Louis Gagnaire réclame alors l'exclusion du parti de Gérard Filoche, qu'il qualifie d'« individu abject ».


=== Exclusion du Parti socialiste ===
Le 17 novembre 2017, Gérard Filoche relaie sur Twitter un photomontage représentant Patrick Drahi, Jacob Rothschild et Jacques Attali entourant Emmanuel Macron, qui porte un brassard nazi où le symbole du dollar remplace la croix gammée, avec le slogan « En Marche vers le chaos mondial », le tout sur fond de drapeaux américain et israélien. L'image, tirée du site d'extrême-droite Égalité et Réconciliation, est accompagnée du message : « Un sale type, les Français vont le savoir tous ensemble bientôt ». Cette publication suscite des réactions indignées d'une partie de la classe politique, notamment de La République en Marche, mais aussi venant de son propre camp, comme Juliette Méadel, qui dénoncent un tweet à caractère antisémite et complotiste.
Gérard Filoche retire son tweet quelques heures après sa publication, mais dénonce sur son blog une « diversion », un « complot » et une « cabale » de la part du parti majoritaire, avant de présenter ses excuses le lendemain matin sur Twitter, toujours en dénonçant une « cabale en meute » pour une « image totalement banale ». Le représentant légal du PS, Rachid Temal, annonce saisir la direction du PS pour procéder à son exclusion.
Le 21 novembre 2017, le bureau national du PS décide à l'unanimité d'exclure Gérard Filoche.

642,"Seymour Duncan est une marque de micros pour guitares et basses, qui a été fondée en 1976 par le guitariste Seymour W. Duncan, originaire du New Jersey aux États-Unis.
L'entreprise de Seymour Duncan est une des leaders du marché international dans la vente de micros depuis 30 ans, et est située à Santa Barbara en Californie. Seymour Duncan a consacré la majeure partie de sa vie à construire des micros qui font le son des différentes scènes musicales de nos jours.
Ces différents choix de micros (plus d'une centaine) sont aussi bien destinés à un usage amateur que professionnel. Tous ces micros sans exception sont fabriqués à la main par des experts.
On lui doit des micros pour guitare tels que les micros double bobinage ou humbucker Jazz, JB (Jazz/Blues, fait originellement pour le guitariste britannique Jeff Beck) et Trembucker, ainsi que les Hot et Cool Rails, micros double bobinage au format et à la taille d'un micro simple bobinage, qui sont définitivement rentrés dans le panthéon du micro pour guitare compte tenu de leurs qualités et de leur notoriété auprès du public concerné.
La fameuse Gibson Les Paul de Slash, ancien guitariste des Guns N' Roses, n'est pas équipée de micros Gibson mais d'une paire de humbucker Seymour Duncan (pro-humbucker Alnico 2).


== Fender Custom Shop Seymour Duncan Signature Esquire ==
Le Custom Shop du pionnier californien des guitares électriques Fender sortit en 2003 une copie exacte de la Fender Esquire personnelle du guitariste, fabriquée en 1954, équipée d'un micro chevalet Broadcaster ""Duncan Designed"" conçu par Seymour lui-même. Cette guitare propose un corps plein (solid-body) en frêne léger au coloris 2-colour sunburst avec une finition vernie en laque de nitrocellulose (thin-skin nitrocellulose lacquer) et un manche en érable moucheté à 21 cases, une plaque blanche simple pli et des mécaniques Gotoh/Kluson traditionnelles. Chaque étape de la conception de la guitare est personnellement supervisée par Seymour, y compris le câblage spécial qu'il a réalisé sur chacune de ses guitares. Le vernis cellulosique utilisé, a été appliqué en couches très fines, y compris sur le manche.

645,"L'entrée de Jésus à Jérusalem est un événement tiré des quatre évangiles canoniques, il a lieu dans les jours précédant la Cène, marquant le début de la Passion du Christ,,,.
Dans Jean 12, 9–11, après la résurrection de Lazare d'entre les morts, des foules se rassemblent à Béthanie apprenant la présence de Jésus et voulant constater le miracle. Le lendemain, les foules qui se sont rassemblées à Jérusalem pour la fête accueillent Jésus à son entrée dans la ville.
Dans Matthieu 21, 1–11, Marc 11, 1–11, Luc 19, 28–44 et Jean 12, 12–19, Jésus descend du mont des Oliviers vers Jérusalem où les foules étendent leur vêtement sur le chemin pour l'accueillir, entrant solennellement dans la ville.
Les chrétiens commémorent l'entrée triomphale de Jésus à Jérusalem pendant le dimanche des Rameaux, une semaine avant le dimanche de Pâques.


== Récits évangéliques ==

Selon les Évangiles, avant d'entrer dans Jérusalem, Jésus se trouvait à Béthanie et Bethphagé, et il est dit dans Jean 12, 1 qu'il était à Béthanie, six jours avant la Pâque. Pendant ce temps, Jésus envoya deux de ses disciples dans le village qui se trouve devant eux, afin de récupérer un ânon qui avait été attaché, mais jamais été monté, et de dire, si on les interrogeait sur pourquoi ils faisaient cela, que Le Seigneur en a besoin, et qu'il le renverra très bientôt,,.

Jésus monte alors l'ânon à Jérusalem, avec les trois évangiles synoptiques indiquant que les disciples avaient au préalable déposé leurs manteaux sur ce dernier, de manière à le rendre plus confortable. Dans la tradition juive, l'âne semble avoir été un animal positif, symbolisant l'humilité et la paix, alors que le cheval symbolise le luxe et la violence guerrière,,.
Dans Luc 19, 41, lorsque Jésus approche de Jérusalem, il l'embrassa du regard et pleura sur elle (événement connu sous le nom latin de Flevit super illam), prédisant la souffrance qui attend la ville,. Les Évangiles continuent de raconter comment Jésus est entré dans Jérusalem, et comment les gens déposaient leurs manteaux devant lui, ainsi que des petites branches d'arbres. Les gens chantaient une partie du Psaume 118, 25–26 : Oui, béni soit celui qui vient au nom de l'Eternel ! Nous vous bénissons tous de la maison de l'Eternel,,,...
Dans les évangiles synoptiques, cet épisode est suivi de celui de la purification du Temple, et dans les quatre évangiles, Jésus accomplit diverses guérisons et enseigne en paraboles durant son séjour à Jérusalem, jusqu'à la Cène,.


== Parallèles avec l'Ancien Testament ==

Matthieu 21, 1–11 se réfère à un passage du livre de Zacharie (9, 9) et déclare :
« Tout cela arriva pour que se réalise la prédiction du prophète : Dites à la communauté de Sion, Voici ton Roi qui vient à toi ; humble, il vient monté sur une ânesse, sur un ânon, le petit d'une bête de somme. »
L'emplacement du mont des Oliviers est significatif dans l'Ancien Testament en ce que Zacharie 9, 9 et Zacharie 14, 1–5 déclarent que le Messie viendrait à Jérusalem depuis le mont des Oliviers, :
« Puis l'Eternel viendra combattre ces nations comme il le fait quand il combat au jour de la bataille. En ce jour-là, il posera ses pieds sur le mont des Oliviers, près de Jérusalem, du côté du levant. »
L'entrée triomphale et les branches de palmier, ressemblent à la célébration de la libération des Juifs dans I Maccabées (13, 51) qui stipule :
« Les Juifs entrent dans la Citadelle [...] Avec des chants de louange, ils portent des branches de palmiers. Ils chantent des hymnes et d'autres chants au son des harpes, des cymbales et des cithares. »
L'entrée de Jésus sur un âne possède un parallèle dans Zacharie 9, 9 qui stipule que :
« Car ton roi vient vers toi, il est juste et victorieux, humble, monté sur un âne. »
Le symbolisme de l'âne peut également se référer à la tradition orientale, un animal de paix, par rapport au cheval, qui est un animal de guerre. Ainsi, un roi arrivait chevauchant un cheval quand il était prêt à la guerre et monté un âne quand il voulait souligner qu'il venait en paix. Par conséquent, l'entrée de Jésus à Jérusalem symbolisait son entrée en tant que Prince de la Paix et non pas en tant qu'un roi belliciste,.

647,"Peetie Wheatstraw (1902-1941), de son vrai nom William Bunch, est un pianiste et chanteur de blues américain, né à Ripley, au Tennessee et décédé à East Saint Louis, dans l'Illinois.


== Biographie ==
Le pseudonyme de « Peetie Wheatstraw », que William Bunch prend, fait référence à un personnage du folklore afro-américain, la moitié maléfique d'une personnalité double. On le nomme aussi « le beau-frère du diable » ou « le haut shériff de l'Enfer ». Ce personnage de Peetie Wheatstraw est décrit dans l'œuvre de Ralph Ellison. Cette auto-représentation sulfureuse rappelle celle de Robert Johnson et de Tommy Johnson. Bunch prétend comme eux s'être perdu au carrefour (Crossroads) et avoir vendu son âme au prince des Ténèbres.
La biographie de Wheatstraw est très lacunaire. Peu est connu de sa vie. Il arrive en 1929 à East Saint Louis. Il y meurt en 1941, alors qu'embarqué dans une voiture, lui et ses compagnons tentent de battre à la course un train en franchissant la voie ferrée.


== Carrière ==
William Bunch arrive en 1929 à East Saint Louis. Il devient vite célèbre à Chicago et enregistre pour les disques Bluebird puis pour Decca. Il enregistre 175 faces, un chiffre extraordinaire pour un bluesman des années 1930 et qui montre la popularité dont il jouissait dans tout le pays.
La postérité a été plus dure avec Wheatstraw. Les critiques du blues ont jugé souvent sa musique comme étant pauvre et répétitive. Il peut être aussi vu comme celui qui amena le blues rural dans le monde urbain, permettant les développements ultérieurs de cette musique.

650,"L’expédition Walker est une tentative britannique, menée par l'amiral Hovenden Walker, d'attaquer la ville de Québec en 1711 lors de la Deuxième Guerre intercoloniale et dans le contexte de la guerre de Succession d'Espagne. Son échec est dû à une catastrophe maritime sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent le 22 août 1711 lorsque sept navires de transport et un de vivres se sont échoués près de l'île aux Œufs. Quelque 850 soldats se sont noyés dans cette catastrophe, qui était à l'époque l'une des pires catastrophes navales de l'histoire britannique.


== Contexte ==
En 1710, à la fin de la guerre de Succession d'Espagne, un groupe comprenant des militaires britanniques et des colons américains ont capturé le fort français de Port-Royal, sur la côte nord-ouest de l'Acadie. Francis Nicholson, le chef de cette expédition, a apporté la nouvelle de la victoire à Londres, où lui et Jeremiah Dummer, un représentant de la province de la baie du Massachusetts ont réclamé une expédition vers le cœur de la Nouvelle-France, Québec.
Le gouvernement britannique était cependant en pleine crise et en août 1710, le gouvernement de Sidney Godolphin choit. La reine Anne le remplaça par Robert Harley, un opposant du duc de Marlborough, qui était aussi tombé en défaveur. Harley voulait changer la stratégie militaire britannique en mettant l'emphase sur la force de la marine, au désavantage de l'armée terrestre. Il voulait aussi réduire l'influence encore existante du duc de Marlborough par une victoire militaire de sa propre initiative. C'est avec cet objectif qu'il planifia une expédition par la mer et par la terre dans le but de capturer Québec; il tomba cependant malade et la majorité de la planification a été faite par son secrétaire d'État, Henri St. John.
Le plan a suivi une proposition faite par Samuel Vetch (en) en 1708, pour une expédition prévue pour 1709, dont la force principale était constitué d'une expédition navale transportant à la fois l'armée régulière et la milice provinciale. On donna le commandement de l'expédition au Contre-amiral de l'escadre blanche Hovenden Walker avec l'appui du brigadier John Hill (en) pour la force terrestre.

651,"La ligne Toei Asakusa (都営地下鉄浅草線, Toei Chikatetsu Asakusa-sen) est une ligne de métro à Tokyo au Japon gérée par le Bureau des Transports de la Métropole de Tokyo (Toei). Elle relie la station de Nishi-Magome à celle d'Oshiage. Longue de 18,4 km, elle traverse Tokyo du sud au nord-est en passant dans les arrondissements d'Ōta, Shinagawa, Minato, Chūō, Taitō et Sumida. Elle est également connue comme ligne 1. Sur les cartes, la ligne est de couleur rose et identifiée par la lettre A.
En pratique, du fait de l'interconnexion avec le réseau Keikyū à Sengakuji, la ligne est coupée en deux, formant deux sous-lignes : (Narita -) Oshiage - Sengakuji (- Haneda) et Sengakuji - Nishi-Magome ; seulement un quart des trains parcourent toute la ligne Asakusa.


== Histoire ==
La ligne Asakusa est la première ligne construite par le Gouvernement métropolitain de Tokyo. Son nom de projet était ligne 1 puis elle a été renommée ligne Asakusa en référence au quartier qu'elle traverse.
Le premier tronçon de 3,2 km entre Oshiage et Asakusabashi a été inauguré le 4 décembre 1960. La ligne a été ensuite prolongée en plusieurs étapes, du nord au sud :
Mai 1962 : d'Asakusabashi à Higashi-Nihonbashi
Septembre 1962 : de Higashi-Nihonbashi à Ningyōchō
Février 1963 : de Ningyōchō à Higashi-Ginza
Décembre 1963 : de Higashi-Ginza à Shimbashi
Octobre 1964 : de Shimbashi à Daimon
Juin 1968 : de Daimon à Sengakuji (Mise en place de l'interconnexion avec le réseau Keikyū)
Novembre 1968 : de Sengakuji à Nishi-Magome


== Interconnexions ==
La ligne est interconnectée à Sengakuji avec la ligne principale Keikyū de la compagnie Keikyū et à Oshiage avec la ligne Oshiage de la compagnie Keisei.


== Stations ==
La ligne comporte 20 stations, identifiées de A-01 à A-20.


== Matériel roulant ==
La ligne Asakusa est parcourue par les trains des compagnies Toei, Keikyū, Keisei, Hokusō et Shibayama.

652,"Un saignement artériel est une hémorragie provoquée par toute plaie d'une artère, occasionnant un jet de sang. L'intensité de ce saignement en jet, rythmé par les battements cardiaques, dépend de la pression artérielle et de la taille de la plaie. La quantité de sang perdue peut être importante très rapidement, et ainsi conduire à une mort rapide. L'arrêt de l'hémorragie, en premier lieu par un point de compression, est donc impératif.
Les expressions giclée de sang, poussée de sang, pulvérisation de sang, jet de sang, gicle artérielle ou artérielle jaillissante sont rencontrées[réf. nécessaire].


== Mécanisme ==
En coupant une artère carotide contenant 100 ml de sang dans le cœur à chaque battement qui est de 65 battements par minute, une artère complètement rompu fera jaillir du sang pendant environ 30 secondes. Si l'artère est seulement entaillée, le sang jaillira plus mais sortira sous une certaine pression et sa pulvérisation sera beaucoup plus élevée. Pour éviter une ischémie de la main, il y a un test qui implique de faire gicler le sang de l'artère radiale.
En 1933, un procès pour assassinat a incité un témoignage du Dr Clément Harrisse Arnold afin de savoir jusqu'où le sang pourrait jaillir du cou : il a été retenu que c'était de 6 pouces donc environ 15 cm à la verticale et de 18 pouces donc environ 46 cm à l'horizontale.


== Prise en charge ==
Un saignement artériel, comme tout saignement, menace le pronostic vital, il est donc nécessaire de l'arrêter. Dans l'immédiat, la prise en charge simple consiste à assurer un point de compression au niveau du saignement. Rapidement, une prise en charge chirurgicale est à envisager en fonction de la gravité des lésions.


== Animaux ==
Certains animaux autohaemorrhage se défendent en faisant gicler délibérément leur propre sang. Les grillons blindés, qui sont originaires de Namibie, d'Afrique du Sud et du Botswana, ont une façon unique de chasser les prédateurs : elles crachent du vomi et du sang. les sauterelles font de même que les grillons blindés d’où leurs surnom de Blutspritzer en Allemagne. Le lézard à cornes, aussi, utilise la tactique du cracha de sang à partir d'une poche près de ses yeux.


== Dans la culture ==


=== Religion ===
Chinnamastâ, la décapitée, est une déesse hindoue qui est représentée en tenant sa tête dans ses mains avec trois giclement de sang provenant de son cou.
Saint Miliau, est un martyr chrétien tué vers le VIe siècle après Jésus-Christ, qui est parfois représenté tenant sa tête coupée, comme dans le retable de la Passion du Christ à Lampaul-Guimiliau, où le sang jaillit de son cou.


=== Dans la fiction ===
Le giclement de sang est utilisé comme effet spécial dans le théâtre, dans les films d'horreur et d'action, les séries télévisées, les dessins animés, les bandes dessinées et les jeux vidéo.
Dans Monty Python, Sam Peckinpah's ""Salad Days (qui est une parodie), il y a une grande quantité de giclement de sang. Dans Monty Python : Sacré Graal ! de 1975, Le Roi Arthur coupe les deux bras et les deux jambes du Chevalier noir.
Le roman de 1985, Méridien de sang de Cormac McCarthy, comprend une scène dans laquelle l'un des deux Jacksons décapite l'autre, conduisant à un giclement de sang décrit graphiquement par l'auteur.
Dans les films Rape and revenge et Œil pour œil d'abord publié en 1978 et réédité pour un large public en 1980, contenait plusieurs scènes sanglantes.
Le film Star Trek 6 : Terre inconnue de 1991 a une scène où un Klingon est abattu. Le sang qui jaillit des blessures du Klingon a été créée en utilisant l'imagerie générée par ordinateur, les animateurs devaient faire en sorte que le sang flotte d'une manière convaincante sans être trop gore. L'artiste des effets spéciaux a regardé des images de la NASA pour savoir comment faire flotter les globules d'eau pour faire de même avec des particules de sang.
Les jeux vidéo peuvent utiliser un système de particules pour créer des effets de giclées de sang. Les effets spéciaux de sang jaillissant dans Mortal Kombat en 1992 ont engendré des controverses qui ont servi à augmenter sa popularité.
En 2003, le film Kill Bill multiplie les scènes où le katana est utilisé dans les combats, entrainant de manière exagéré des giclements de sang énorme.
Dans la série télévisée de 2010, Spartacus: Blood and Sand il y a des « geysers de sang [qui] jaillissent des organes des morts » et que « chaque giclement de sang est filmé au ralenti et en stop-action ».
La série télévisée Dexter est centré autour de la vie d'un spécialiste des éclaboussures de sang, nommé Dexter Morgan qui est aussi un tueur en série travaillant dans le département de la police de Miami.
Conan O'Brien a été mordu par deux kraken qui sont des monstres marins dans le film de SyFy, Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda de 2014 où sa tête continue à injecter de grandes quantités de sang quand il est ballotté par les joueurs de volley-ball,.

654,"L'abbaye de Dundrennan, à Dundrennan en Écosse, est un monastère cistercien de style roman, fondé en 1142 par des moines de l'abbaye de Rievaulx soutenus par Fergus de Galloway et le roi David Ier d'Écosse (1124-1153).
Bien qu'en grande partie en ruines (seuls sont encore debout le transept et la nef de l'église abbatiale), Dundrennan, par la sobriété de son architecture, illustre encore parfaitement l'idéal cistercien d'austérité.


== Histoire ==


=== Fondation ===

L'abbaye de Dundrennan est fondée en 1142 par Fergus de Galloway et David Ier d'Écosse, amis proches. Le lieu aurait été trouvé par le premier des deux ; il serait nommé d'après une racine gaélique (« Dun-nan-droigheann » signifiant « fort des buissons épineux ». Le site de l'abbaye, qui se trouve au-dessus du Solway Firth, est en effet entouré de landes et de marécages. Il est très vraisemblable, mais non absolument certain, que ce soient des moines de Rievaulx qui aient fondé l'abbaye ; ce qui est en revanche certain, ce sont les nombreuses visites d'Aelred de Rievaulx à Dundrennan durant son abbatiat, preuve de la filiation de Dundrennan.


=== Moyen Âge ===
L'abbaye connaît une histoire assez paisible et donc peu relatée dans les chroniques.


=== Dissolution ===
Néanmoins, en 1529, la désaffection de l'abbaye en avait accéléré la ruine et l'appauvrissement ; c'est une abbaye réduite à un seizième de sa valeur médiévale qui est dissoute par Henri VIII.


== Architecture ==


=== L'église abbatiale ===
L'église abbatiale est de style gothique. Aujourd'hui ruinée, elle a conservé son transept, une partie du chœur, de la nef, ainsi que la façade de la salle capitulaire. Le chevet est entièrement détruit.

Elle est la fille de Jean Charles Séailles (1883-1967) et de Spéranza Calo (Constantinople, 17 mai 1885 - Paris, 18 février 1949), cantatrice mezzo-soprano, fille d’un peintre réputé de Constantinople, mariés en février 1913, et installés à Antony avant le printemps 1918. Son grand-père paternel, Gabriel Séailles (1852-1923), était professeur de philosophie en Sorbonne, et sa grand-mère paternelle, Octavie Charles Paul Séailles (1855-1944), était artiste peintre.
Elle est la deuxième des quatre enfants :
Jean Séailles (1915-2010). Il s'engagea dans la résistance, avec son épouse Krino : connu sous le pseudo « commandant Grégoire », il organisa le maquis de Saint-Mars-du-Désert (Mayenne), tout en étant adjoint du chef du réseau Aristide du SOE et chef départemental des FFI.
Simone Séailles (1917-1945). Comme son frère Pierre, elle s'illustra dans le réseau Sylvestre-FARMER du SOE. Elle fut arrêtée par la Gestapo dans un café de l'avenue de Wagram à Paris, le 21 janvier 1944, et mourut à Ravensbrück (matricule 47.182).
Pierre Séailles (1919-2007), agent du Special Operations Executive (SOE).
Violette Séailles (1926-1966).


== Biographie ==
C'est sans informer leurs parents que les enfants Séailles à l'exception de Violette entrent dans la Résistance.
Début janvier 1942, voulant gagner l’Angleterre, son frère Pierre tente de passer la ligne de démarcation. Il est arrêté par les gendarmes à Montrésor, et conduit en détention à Périgueux. Là, il fait la connaissance d’officiers du SOE, en particulier de Michael Trotobas. Ils sont bientôt transférés à Mauzac (Dordogne). Onze agents du SOE, dont Michael Trotobas, réussissent à s’en évader dans la nuit du 15 au 16 juillet 1942. Simone dans le même temps fait la connaissance au 86 rue d'Assas à Paris, et devient l'agent de liaison du capitaine Michel Trotobas dans son réseau « Sylvestre », elle y est connue sous le nom de Violette. Agent de liaison entre le Nord et la capitale et chargée de trouver des fonds.
Fin 1942, Simone recrute une ancienne camarade de lycée, Nathalie Altovsky, qui secondera son frère Pierre dans plusieurs missions. Elle sera entre autres chargée d'entrer en contact avec un gardien du camp de Mauzac pour tenter de faire évader ses compagnons prisonniers. Puis elles s'occuperont toutes les deux de collecter des fonds pour la Résistance et pour Londres. Les deux femmes dormaient ici et là tantôt dans de luxueux studios, tantôt dans un taudis, ou un hôtel de passe. Nathalie assistera impuissante à l'arrestation de Simone. En décembre 1942 le capitaine Michel installe son PC à Lille au café de Madame Mado Thiroux.
Le 21 janvier 1943, Séailles est enfin libéré. Simone qui est devenue agent de liaison SOE) l’informe par message qu’un « Michel » l’attend d’urgence à Lille, où, bien entendu, il se rend immédiatement. C’est Michael Trotobas, chef éponyme du réseau Sylvestre-FARMER, qui veut en faire son adjoint. Sous le nom de guerre de « Pierrot », il devient alors une sorte d’alter ego de Trotobas, qui veut qu’il soit au courant de tout et le charge de la préparation des plans d’action ; si bien qu’à la mort du chef, le 27 novembre 1943, il est à même de prendre la suite sans qu’apparaisse la moindre coupure. Londres le charge officiellement de prendre la tête du réseau, sous l’autorité et en liaison avec René Dumont-Guillemet, chef du réseau Armand-SPIRITUALIST, qui contrôle de loin et, surtout, assure les liaisons avec le service. Il divise alors le réseau - qui a pris une importance considérable - en régions, dont il choisit soigneusement les responsables ; et il assume pleinement le commandement de ce qui est bien l’un des plus grands réseaux de la section F. Séailles planifie des opérations de guérilla à grande échelle. Il prépare surtout le seul sabotage de ce type réalisé en France : l’arrachage des voies ferrées à l’aide d’un soc fixé à l’avant de la locomotive, dans la nuit du 26 au 27 août, sur trois sites différents.
Le 21 janvier 1944, elle est arrêtée par la Gestapo dans un café de l'avenue Wagram à Paris, puis déportée le 4 juillet 1944 de la Gare de l'Est à Paris à destination de la prison de la Gestapo à Neue Bremm en Allemagne, puis toujours en 1944 au camp de Stalag II-A à Neubrandenbourg. C'est là que, présente depuis seulement quelques semaines, elle fait circuler une pétition que plusieurs co-détenues signèrent pour demander que les déportées politiques ne soient pas contraintes au travail. Elle remit personnellement celle-ci au commandant du camp, ce qui lui valut huit jours sans pain, et la menace d'être pendue si elle ne cessait pas sa rébellion. Elle dût bien se résigner mais grâce à son action ses compagnes avaient retrouvé le sens de la dignité et à Ravensbrück sous le matricule 47182-KL Ravensbrück. Le camp est libéré par la Croix-Rouge le 3 mai 1945 et par l'Armée soviétique le 8 mai 1945; elle décède de son internement à l'hôpital du camp de concentration de Theresienstadt, commune de Terezin.
Pierre Séailles reprend après la guerre, auprès de son père, la fabrication de pièces en Lap, en utilisant de nouvelles techniques: (Lap à décor flotté) et continuera en compagnie de son épouse Brigitte Amherdt et de son fils Nicolas.
Pierre Séailles meurt le 3 juin 2007, à l’âge de 88 ans. Il est enterré au cimetière de Longvilliers (Yvelines).
Les cendres de Simone seront rapatriées de Tchécoslovaquie le 29 mai 1948 à Antony et furent déposées dans le caveau de famille auprès de ses parents et de sa sœur Violette.

659,"Wicd, qui signifie Wireless Interface Connection Daemon, i.e. plus ou moins « service de connexion d'interface sans-fil », est un logiciel libre et Open-Source destiné à gérer à la fois les réseaux filaires et sans-fil sous GNU/Linux.


== Historique ==
Le projet a débuté fin 2006 par la création de « Connection Manager », lequel est finalement devenu « wicd ». Wicd a pour objectif de fournir une interface simple de connexion aux réseaux, avec une grande variété de paramètres.


== Description ==
Wicd se connecte automatiquement seulement aux réseaux sans-fil qui lui sont indiqués et ne se connectera pas automatiquement à un réseau inconnu.
Wicd prend en charge les systèmes de chiffrement sans-fil en utilisant wpa supplicant. Les utilisateurs peuvent créer leurs propres modèles, qui peuvent ensuite être utilisés par Wicd pour se connecter à une grande variété de réseaux utilisant n'importe quel type de chiffrement pris en charge par wpa_supplicant. Étant donné que Wicd n'utilise aucune dépendance GNOME, il peut facilement être utilisé avec Gnome, KDE, Xfce, Fluxbox, ou n'importe quel autre gestionnaire de fenêtres.
Wicd est séparé en deux composants majeurs : le daemon et l'interface utilisateur. Ces deux composants communiquent via D-Bus. Ce design permet à l'interface utilisateur de fonctionner en tant qu'utilisateur standard et au daemon en tant qu'utilisateur root. Ainsi l'utilisateur peut changer de réseau sans-fil sans avoir connaissance du mot de passe root. Le design interface/daemon séparés permet en outre à quelqu'un de coder une nouvelle interface pour le daemon Wicd, telle que wicd-qt.
Wicd est actuellement inclus dans certaines distributions GNU/Linux telles que Slackware, Zenwalk Linux, Arch Linux, ou encore Debian GNU/Linux.


== Comparaison avec Network Manager ==
Est capable de distinguer deux points d'accès possédant le même SSID mais des adresses MAC différentes.
Ne possède pas de dépendances GNOME et est donc indépendant de l'environnement. Il utilise GTK.
Fournit la liste des réseaux dans une fenêtre au lieu d'un menu déroulant depuis l'icône du tableau de bord (mais il le peut aussi).
Ne se connecte pas à un réseau filaire tant que l'utilisateur ne le lui a pas ordonné.
Ne se connecte pas à un réseau sans-fil tant que l'utilisateur ne le lui a pas ordonné.
Dans les deux cas, il peut quand même se connecter automatiquement à un réseau qu'il connait.
Permet l'utilisation de DNS statiques et/ou d'une configuration IP statique, pour les réseaux filaires et sans-fil.
Ne gère ni les VPN, ni le PPPoE/DSL.

660,"La collégiale Saint-Frambourg est une ancienne église consacrée à saint Fraimbault (également appelé Frambourg), située à Senlis dans le département de l'Oise. C'est actuellement une salle de concert consacrée à la musique classique, propriété de la Fondation Cziffra. Elle fait l’objet d’un classement au titre des monuments historiques par la liste de 1862.


== La fondation de la chapelle royale ==
Cette chapelle royale est fondée à la toute fin du Xe siècle par Adélaïde reine de France et épouse d'Hugues Capet, après l'acclamation de celui-ci dans la ville en 987 par les Grands du royaume. Cette chapelle est dans le même temps une collégiale puisque 12 chanoines y sont affectés. Ceux-ci sont nommés directement par le roi et ne dépendent d'aucune autorité ecclésiastique sinon du Saint-Siège. Ils sont chargés de prier pour le roi et seule la famille royale peut assister aux offices. Faisant l'objet de soins particuliers de la part du roi, la collégiale est dotée d'un grand nombre de reliques.
Elle accueille alors les dépouilles de saint Fraimbault, déplacées de Lassay-les-Châteaux dans le comté du Maine jusque dans la chapelle. On ne sait pas précisément quand le transfert eut lieu, ce saint n'ayant eu aucun contact avec la ville de Senlis au cours de sa vie. On parle de religieux fuyant les Normands et trouvant refuge dans la ville avec les reliques, de seigneur de Senlis ayant combattu avec un comte du Maine, le transfert ayant alors lieu à la fin du IXe siècle. On dit aussi que la reine elle-même fit opérer ce transfert de relique, à la fin du Xe siècle parce que le saint était réputé contribuer à la prospérité de la famille royale et à la tranquillité du royaume. Le corps du saint fut déposé dans une chasse d'argent, hormis le chef demeuré à Lassay.
Des traces de bâtiments antérieurs au Xe siècle ont été retrouvés au cours des fouilles archéologiques sur le site. Le bâtiment le plus ancien retrouvé est un bâtiment rectangulaire de petite taille, situé à l'intérieur de l'ancien rempart gallo-romain de la ville.


== La collégiale gothique ==
L'église actuelle est construite à partir de 1169  : sont construits jusque vers 1200 le chœur et les deux premières travées de la nef. En 1177, une grande cérémonie d'exposition des reliques est organisée par les chanoines, en présence du roi Louis VII de France, afin d'encourager les donations en faveur de la construction de l'édifice. Cette nef est achevée, ainsi que la base du clocher au cours d'une seconde campagne de construction de 1205 à 1230. Le clocher est achevé à la fin du XIIIe siècle, ainsi que des chapelles latérales.
Elle est fermée en 1790, transformée en Temple de la raison puis vendue comme bien national en 1798. Le portail est alors mutilé et le clocher en partie démoli. Le bâtiment sert tour à tour de manège par l'Armée prussienne en 1815, de magasin et d'entrepôt.


== Restaurations et usages actuels ==
Le pianiste d'origine hongroise Georges Cziffra rachète les bâtiments en 1973 pour accueillir sa fondation créée en 1974 et entame la restauration intérieure. À cette occasion, des fouilles archéologiques sont réalisées et mettent au jour les restes de la chapelle royale du Xe siècle. Des constructions parasites au sud de la nef et au chevet sont démolies. De nouveaux vitraux sont installés en 1977, dont huit sont décorés par l'artiste catalan Joan Miró, ami de Cziffra, en collaboration avec le maître-verrier Charles Marq.
Inaugurée le 24 septembre 1977, l'église sert désormais d'auditorium, baptisé Franz Liszt, pour des concerts de musique de chambre tout au long de l'année. Manque encore la reconstruction du toit. En effet, depuis le début du XIXe siècle, le pignon ouest ainsi que la plupart de la charpente (sauf sur le chœur) font défaut ; l'église est simplement couverte par des plaques de zinc disposées horizontalement. En février 1990, une tempête en arrache une partie, remplacées provisoirement par des bâches ; situation qui perdure au moment du décès de Georges Cziffra en 1994. Sa veuve prend ensuite en main la reconstruction totale de la toiture et du pignon, travaux qui s'achèvent le 4 septembre 2002, redonnant enfin son aspect d'origine à l'église (exception faite du clocher, à jamais perdu). En 2015, la fondation Cziffra lance un appel à la générosité pour acquérir cette bâtisse. Elle n'en a jusqu'alors que l'usage à titre gratuit, depuis quarante ans, grâce à la famille Cziffra. En 2016, Henry Hermand facilité l'acquisition de la Collégiale par cette fondation Georges Cziffra, en lui faisant un don de 1 million d'Euro.
Le prix Cziffra est remis chaque année à des lauréats, âgés de 15 à 25 ans, au cours d'auditions qui se déroulent dans la collégiale. Des expositions d'œuvres d'arts contemporaines sont organisées ponctuellement.

3 novembre : Constance II est Milan où il abolit toute la législation et les actes de Magnence. Il y reste jusqu'au 3 juillet 353.

Alamans et Francs coalisés profitent de la guerre entre prétendants au trône impérial pour franchir le limes. Ils battent l'armée romaine de Décentius, prennent 40 villes et s'installent entre Moselle et Rhin. Cette invasion est attestée par la découverte de trésors enterré alors à Argentorate (église Saint-Étienne de Strasbourg), Mackwiller, Villing en Lorraine et Augst, en Suisse.

667,"En mathématiques, et plus particulièrement en analyse complexe, une fonction elliptique est, grossièrement parlant, une fonction définie sur le plan complexe qui est doublement périodique (périodique dans deux directions). Elle peut être vue comme analogue à une fonction trigonométrique (qui a une seule période).


== Description ==
Formellement, une fonction elliptique est une fonction méromorphe f définie sur ℂ pour laquelle il existe deux nombres complexes non nuls a et b tels que :

  
    
      
        
          
            a
            b
          
        
        ∉
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {a \over b}\not \in \mathbb {R} }
   ;

  
    
      
        ∀
        z
        ∈
        
          C
        
         
        f
        (
        z
        +
        a
        )
        =
        f
        (
        z
        +
        b
        )
        =
        f
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall z\in \mathbb {C} \ f(z+a)=f(z+b)=f(z)}
  .
De ceci, il suit que : 
  
    
      
        ∀
        z
        ∈
        
          C
        
        ,
        ∀
        m
        ∈
        
          Z
        
        ,
        ∀
        n
        ∈
        
          Z
        
         
        f
        (
        z
        +
        m
        a
        +
        n
        b
        )
        =
        f
        (
        z
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall z\in \mathbb {C} ,\forall m\in \mathbb {Z} ,\forall n\in \mathbb {Z} \ f(z+ma+nb)=f(z).}
  
À noter que si une fonction elliptique est holomorphe alors elle est nécessairement constante en vertu du théorème de Liouville. Les cas intéressants sont donc ceux où la fonction elliptique admet au moins un pôle.
La plus importante classe de fonctions elliptiques est celle des fonctions elliptiques de Weierstrass ; toute fonction elliptique peut être exprimée à l'aide de celles-ci.
Les fonctions elliptiques sont les applications réciproques des fonctions intégrales elliptiques, et c'est de cette façon qu'historiquement elles ont été introduites.
Tout nombre complexe ω tel que 
  
    
      
        ∀
        z
        ∈
        
          C
        
         
        f
        (
        z
        +
        ω
        )
        =
        f
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall z\in \mathbb {C} \ f(z+\omega )=f(z)}
   est appelé « période » de f. Si les deux périodes a et b sont telles que toute autre période ω puisse être écrite sous la forme ω = ma + nb avec m et n entiers, alors a et b sont appelées « périodes fondamentales ». Toute fonction elliptique non constante possède une paire de périodes fondamentales, mais elle n'est pas unique.
Si a et b sont des périodes fondamentales, alors tout parallélogramme de sommets d'affixes z, z + a, z + b, z + a + b est appelé un « parallélogramme fondamental ». Translater un tel parallélogramme d'un multiple entier de a et b donne un parallélogramme du même type, et la fonction f se comporte identiquement sur ce parallélogramme translaté, à cause de la périodicité.
Le nombre de pôles dans tout parallélogramme fondamental est fini (et le même pour tout parallélogramme fondamental). À moins que la fonction elliptique ne soit constante, tout parallélogramme contient au moins un pôle, conséquence du théorème de Liouville.
La somme des ordres des pôles dans tout parallélogramme fondamental est appelée l’« ordre » de la fonction elliptique. La somme des résidus des pôles dans un parallélogramme fondamental est nulle, donc aucune fonction elliptique ne peut avoir un ordre égal à 1.
La dérivée d'une fonction elliptique est encore une fonction elliptique, de même période. L'ensemble de toutes les fonctions elliptiques de mêmes périodes fondamentales forme un corps commutatif. Plus précisément, étant donné un couple de périodes, toute fonction elliptique admettant ce couple de périodes peut être définie sur une certaine surface de Riemann : le tore complexe obtenu par recollement des couples de côtés opposés du parallélogramme fondamental. Les fonctions elliptiques sont alors les fonctions méromorphes sur ce tore. Par ailleurs, la fonction de Weierstrass associée à ce couple de périodes et sa dérivée paramètrent une certaine courbe complexe : une courbe elliptique.

668,"Il Becco Giallo (littéralement, « Le Bec jaune ») est un journal satirique italien fondé en 1924 et l'un des plus connus des années 1920, notamment pour son antifascisme. Contraint à l'exil par le régime fasciste en 1926, il paraît de nouveau en France de 1927 à 1931.


== Histoire ==
Il Becco Giallo est fondé par Alberto Giannini en 1924 ; le premier numéro paraît en janvier. L'éditorial du premier numéro témoigne bien de son engagement antifasciste :

« [...] appoggiamo [...] con tutte le nostre energie l’opposizione la quale, al regime fascista di dittatoriale violenza che ha invertito tutti i valori morali e col terrorismo ha asservito l’Italia ad una banda di predoni, resiste eroicamente sfidando ogni giorno le più brutali aggressioni e lotta per la libertà soppressa, per la millenaria giustizia italiana conculcata, per la riconquista delle guarentigie costituzionali, per ridare prestigio all’Italia nel mondo. »

L'une des cibles favorites du titre est l'écrivain et dramaturge italien Luigi Pirandello, en raison de son admiration pour le fascisme de Benito Mussolini. Il Becco Giallo, par son engagement politique, est l'un des plus célèbres titres satiriques des années 1920.
En janvier 1926, le titre disparaît lorsque le régime fasciste de Mussolini force Alberto Giannini à l'exil ; il trouve refuge en France,,.
Il Becco Giallo paraît à nouveau à Paris à compter d'août 1927 et jusqu'en août 1931, sous l'impulsion d'Alberto Giannini et Alberto Cianca ; des exemplaires sont clandestinement introduits et diffusés en Italie,.

670,"En matière de spectacle vivant, le producteur de théâtre est le professionnel qui a « la responsabilité d'un spectacle et notamment celle d'employeur à l'égard du plateau artistique ». le producteur réunit les éléments nécessaires à la création du spectacle. Il est responsable du choix de l'œuvre, sollicite les autorisations de représentation de cette œuvre, conçoit et monte les spectacles, coordonne les moyens humains, financiers, techniques et artistiques nécessaires et assume le risque financier de sa commercialisation. Lorsqu'il reprend un spectacle déjà existant, le producteur est qualifié d'entrepreneur de tournée.
Outre la responsabilité du spectacle, le producteur et l'entrepreneur de tournées, sauf s'ils sont simplement diffuseurs, ont la responsabilité d'employeurs à l'égard du plateau artistique (artistes-interprètes et personnel technique attaché directement à la production). En France, la profession de producteur est réglementée. Elle est soumise à la détention obligatoire d'une licence d'entrepreneur de spectacle de 2e catégorie. Cette licence permet de veiller au respect des règles sociales, fiscale et de propriété intellectuelle.

671,"G//Z/R est un groupe de heavy metal britannique, originaire de Birmingham, en Angleterre. Il est formé en 1995 par le bassiste de Black Sabbath, Geezer Butler. Sur le premier album Plastic Planet, le chanteur est Burton C Bell (Fear Factory), le batteur est Deen Castronovo (ex batteur d'Ozzy Osbourne) et le guitariste est Pedro Howse.
À noter que, si pour le premier album, le groupe se nommait G//Z/R, il est à partir de 1997 tout simplement rebaptisé Geezer, puis, finalement, GZR à partir de 2005. La plupart des fans se réfèrent au groupe en tant que Geezer, bien que le bassiste s'y réfère, lui, par les trois lettres G-Z-R. Les deux albums suivant sont enregistrés avec le chanteur Clark Brown. Deen Castronovo est remplacé par l'ancien batteur d'Anacrusis Chad Smith pour l'album Ohmwork.


== Biographie ==
Geezer Butler, bassiste au sein de Black Sabbath, souhaitait déjà s'embarquer dans une carrière solo dans les années 1980, mais cette possibilité n'intervient pas avant 1995, année durant laquelle il publie son premier album solo, Plastic Planet, au label TVT Records sous le nom de GZR. Sur Plastic Planet, Butler est rejoint par Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory) au chant, Pedro Howse à la guitare, et Deen Castronovo à la batterie.
GZR, qui n'est pas un groupe scénique, joue quelques dates en 1997 avec Fear Factory. Cette même année, le groupe publie son deuxième album studio, intitulé Black Science, cette fois sous le nom simple de Geezer. Il fait participer le chanteur inconnu Clark Brown, Howse et Castronovo. Après huit ans d'inactivité, le groupe revient avec un troisième album, intitulé Ohmwork sous le nom de G//Z/R, le 9 mai 2005.

672,"Steinseltz est une commune française située dans le département du Bas-Rhin, en région Grand Est.
Cette commune se trouve dans la région historique et culturelle d'Alsace.


== Géographie ==
La ville se situe sur la rivière Hausauerbach.
Steinseltz est en Outre-Forêt, c'est-à-dire dans la région de Wissembourg et de Cleebourg.
Le village n'a qu'une seule annexe, il s'agit de Schafbusch.


== Histoire ==


=== Origines ===
On trouve à Steinseltz des traces d'occupation du Néolithique, et d'autres du IVe siècle, à l'époque romaine.


=== Moyen Âge ===
L'origine de l'histoire de Steinseltz est intimement liée à celle de l'abbaye de Wissembourg, fondée au VIIIe siècle par le moine Dagobert de Spire. Des lieudits témoignent encore de cette époque lointaine comme celui de Auf der Hub. Une Hub était une parcelle de terre louée par le couvent à des particuliers contre un fermage bien défini.
En 1401, après le déclin de l'abbaye de Wissembourg, les sires de Hohenbourg, s'emparèrent du village comme d'ailleurs de ceux de Cleebourg, Oberhoffen-lès-Wissembourg et Rott. Son successeur Wirich II construisit le château de Cleebourg en 1412.
En 1475, Wirich III s'allia au duc Louis de Deux-Ponts contre le comte électeur palatin Frédéric. Victorieux, ce dernier annexa le village de Steinseltz.


=== De l'époque moderne à 1914 ===
En 1504, Maximilien de Habsbourg attribue le village de Steinseltz au duché de Deux-Ponts, qui y exercent ainsi un droit de collation. Ils intègrent Steinseltz au bailliage de Cleebourg, qu'ils détiennent jusqu’à la Révolution.
Le 4 août 1870, le prince impérial Frédéric Guillaume se rend au lieu-dit de Schafbusch pour s’incliner devant la dépouille d’Abel Douay.


=== Héraldique ===

Le blason résume l'histoire locale : l'étoile est celle de Hohenbourg et le lion est celui du Palatinat du Rhin.


== Toponymie ==
Staanselz en francique méridional.


== Politique et administration ==


== Population et société ==


=== Démographie ===
L'évolution du nombre d'habitants est connue à travers les recensements de la population effectués dans la commune depuis 1793. À partir du 1er janvier 2009, les populations légales des communes sont publiées annuellement dans le cadre d'un recensement qui repose désormais sur une collecte d'information annuelle, concernant successivement tous les territoires communaux au cours d'une période de cinq ans. Pour les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants, une enquête de recensement portant sur toute la population est réalisée tous les cinq ans, les populations légales des années intermédiaires étant quant à elles estimées par interpolation ou extrapolation. Pour la commune, le premier recensement exhaustif entrant dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif a été réalisé en 2006,.
En 2014, la commune comptait 629 habitants, en augmentation de 1,13 % par rapport à 2009 (Bas-Rhin : 1,65 % , France hors Mayotte : 2,49 %)


=== Sports ===


==== FC Steinseltz ====
Durant la saison 2011-2012, le FC Steinseltz, promu de DH Alsace, évolue en CFA 2. Le club, présidé par Thomas Kronenberger, se déplace notamment au stade de la Meinau pour affronter le RC Strasbourg, match perdu 2-0. Le club est notamment sponsorisé par les caves de Cleebourg.
En 1998, le FC Steinseltz s'illustre en atteignant le septième tour de la Coupe de France de football.
Le club accède à la DH en 1999, puis au CFA 2 en 2011, grâce à la défection de l'équipe réserve des SR Colmar. Alors que le club est assuré de monter, Lucien Stohr, l'entraîneur, affirme « Le but, ce sera de conserver nos valeurs. D’accorder de l’importance à la vie du club, de continuer à nous gérer nous-mêmes lors des troisièmes mi-temps. » À cela, Thierry Juncker ajoute « On sait jusqu’où aller, ce qu’il ne faut pas faire. C’est certainement un moment d’histoire, un moment magnifique, c’est aussi un moment bizarre ». Pour son premier match en CFA 2, dont le petit club a été affecté au groupe C, l'équipe partage les points en réalisant un nul 2-2 face à Jarville.


=== La fête du géranium ===
À Steinseltz a lieu, tous les mois d'août des années impaires, une fête en l'honneur du géranium, plante symbole de l'Alsace.


=== Le marché bio ===
Au cœur du village, la Ferme Burger accueille chaque premier mercredi du mois un marché de produits locaux et bio. On y trouve des produits alimentaires (pains, légumes, fruits, huiles, chocolat, miel...) comme des produits esthétiques (huiles essentielles, savons) ou encore des herbes.


== Économie ==
Depuis le XIXe siècle, le village vit de la polyculture. Aujourd'hui, avec la viticulture et l'élevage, le secteur primaire occupe la moitié des actifs, les autres se déplaçants dans les zones industrielles de Wissembourg.


== Lieux monuments ==

L'église catholique et le temple protestant Saint-Laurent.


== Personnalités liées à la commune ==
Marie Jaëll née Marie Trautmann à Steinseltz le 17 août 1846 et décédée à Paris le 4 février 1925, pianiste, compositrice et pédagogue de renom.

676,"Le phare d'Harwich (High) est un phare désaffecté situé dans la ville d'Harwich, dans le comté d'Essex en Angleterre. Appartenant à la ville, il a été transformé en musée.
Ce phare fut géré par le Trinity House Lighthouse Service à Londres, l'organisation de l'aide maritime des côtes de l'Angleterre, de 1836 à 1863.


== Histoire ==
Au moins trois paires de phares ont été construits au cours des derniers siècles avec des feux directionnels pour aider à la navigation des navires entrant dans le port d'Harwich. La première paire était constituée de structures en bois: le High Light (lumière haute) se dressait au sommet de la Old Town Gate, tandis que le Low Light (lumière basse) se trouvait sur la plage. Les deux fonctionnaient au charbon.
En 1818, ils ont été remplacés par des structures en pierre, conçues par John Rennie Senior, qu'on peut encore voir aujourd'hui. Désaffectées en 1863, ils ne fonctionnent plus comme phare : le phare d'Harwich (Low) abrite le musée maritime de la ville, l'autre (Harwih High) a été récemment converti en musée depuis 2015. Ils étaient la propriété du général Rebow de Wivenhoe Park, qui touchait une taxe calculée sur les cargaisons entrant dans le port pour l'entretien des phares. En 1836, ils ont été rachetés par Trinity House, mais en 1863 ils furent déclarés redondants en raison d'un changement de position du chenal utilisé par les navires entrant et sortant du port, causé par les sables mouvants.
Ils furent à leur tour remplacés par une paire de phare en fonte à Dovercourt, à proximité. Ceux-ci sont encore en place, mais ils ont été désaffectés, encore une fois en raison du déplacement du chenal, en 1917.


=== Phare d'Harwich High ===
C'est une tour en brique, à neuf côtés, de 21 m de haut. La lumière était émise des fenêtres supérieures. elle remplaça celle qui était érigée sur le haut d'une porte de la ville. Elle a été construite en 1818 et son feu a été désactivé dès 1863 par Trinity House. Il fonctionnait en feu directionnel avec le phare d'Harwich (Low) à proximité.
Le phare a été transféré au Conseil municipal de la ville d'Harwich en 1909. Partiellement reconstitué par la ville en 1974, la tour est restée vide jusqu'en 1991, puis a été loué pour en faire le Wireless Museum. Le musée a fermé durant l'année 2010. En 2014 le phare a été loué à la Harwich Society avec une ouverture en 2015.

679,"L’imposition en Suisse regroupe l'ensemble des impôts, taxes, redevances, contributions et cotisations sociales auxquels les administrations publiques soumettent les personnes physiques et morales suisses ou vivant en Suisse.


== L'imposition des personnes physiques ==


=== Impôt sur le revenu ===

Toute personne physique domiciliée en Suisse qui reçoit un revenu doit s'acquitter de l'impôt sur le revenu. Cet impôt se décompose en trois niveaux distincts :
l'impôt fédéral direct, prélevé par l'administration fédérale ;
l'impôt cantonal, prélevé par le canton de domicile du contribuable ;
l'impôt communal, prélevé par la commune de domicile du contribuable.
Chaque contribuable doit déclarer ses revenus dans l'année civile qui suit immédiatement la période de taxation.


=== Impôt prélevé à la source ===
Le travailleur étranger qui n'est pas au bénéfice d'une autorisation d'établissement (permis C) est soumis à un type d'imposition sur le revenu spécifique. Au lieu d'être imposé en une seule fois sur les salaires perçus au cours d'une année, le contribuable paie l'impôt chaque mois, celui-ci venant en déduction du salaire brut. Il n'est donc pas nécessaire pour le travailleur soumis à ce type d'impôt de remplir une déclaration de revenus.
Les barèmes d'imposition varient selon les cantons, et c'est le canton du lieu de travail et non du domicile, qui est alors déterminant pour calculer le taux de retenue à la source.
Les travailleurs saisonniers (au bénéfice d'un permis L) et les résidents à l'année (permis B) sont principalement concernés par l'imposition à la source. Certains cantons, notamment le canton de Genève, appliquent également cette méthode de taxation à leurs travailleurs frontaliers.


=== Forfait fiscal ===

Le forfait fiscal est réservé aux étrangers qui vivent en Suisse mais ne travaillent pas et disposent de revenus élevés. Le principe est une imposition à la dépense, basée sur une estimation du train de vie en Suisse.


=== Impôt sur la fortune ===

La fortune imposable comprend la propriété foncière, les biens mobiliers, les assurances sur la vie et de rente rachetables, la fortune investie dans une exploitation commerciale. Seule la fortune nette est imposable, c'est-à-dire que les dettes n'entrent pas en compte et doivent donc être déduites du total des actifs. Le seuil minimum à partir duquel cet impôt est prélevé varie de 17 000 à 100 000 CHF selon les cantons. Cet impôt étant de nature exclusivement cantonale, il est à noter que tous ne le pratiquent pas.


=== Impôt sur la propriété ===

En plus de l'impôt sur la fortune, un impôt spécifique est prélevé sur la valeur locative fiscale ou fictive d'un logement en propriété ou en propriété par étages (PPE). Un montant correspondant à cette valeur est ajouté à la déclaration de revenus du propriétaire.


=== Taxe sur la valeur ajoutée ===

Le principal taux de TVA est fixé à 8 % depuis le 1er janvier 2011 et concerne les biens de consommation non vitaux ainsi que les services. Par opposition à ce taux, dit normal, un taux réduit à 2,5 % concerne la grande majorité des produits alimentaires, les médicaments, les livres et les journaux.
En janvier 2018, les taux de TVA en Suisse baissent : le taux normal de TVA est réduit à 7,7 %, le taux des services d’hébergement à 3,7 %, le taux réduit reste inchangé à 2,5 %. Les entreprise étrangères ne seront plus taxées à partir de 100 000 CHF de chiffre d'affaires en Suisse mais dès cette somme atteinte à l'international. Une mesure qui vise à réduire les désavantages concurrentielles pour les entreprises suisses.
Le 28 septembre 2014, une initiative populaire intitulée « Stop à la TVA discriminatoire pour la restauration ! » est rejetée par le peuple et les cantons. Elle visait à taxer les mets servis dans les restaurants au même taux de TVA que ceux vendus à l'emporter, c'est-à-dire au taux réduit.


=== Droit de timbre ===
Impôt fédéral perçu sur certaines opérations juridiques (notamment titres de sociétés et contrats d'assurance privés) et sur les opérations financières.


== Impôt sur les sociétés ==

Les sociétés paient des impôts là ou elles ont leur siège social.

== Synopsis ==
Albin doit se rendre en Écosse pour recevoir le fabuleux héritage de feu sa tante : un château entouré d'immenses terres, un titre ducal et, surtout, un véritable magot qui permettrait de régler une fois pour toutes les difficultés financières du cabaret tropézien dans lequel il se produit, La Cage aux Folles. Une clause du testament précise toutefois qu'il ne pourra recevoir son héritage qu'une fois marié et devenu père d'un enfant légitime, dans un délai de 18 mois.
Renato, son compagnon et gestionnaire du cabaret, décide de le pousser au mariage. Devant le manque de motivation d'Albin, Renato n'hésite pas à utiliser tous les moyens pour parvenir à ses fins, y compris lui faire croire qu'il est devenu hétérosexuel.

686,"Pipa aspera est une espèce d'amphibiens de la famille des Pipidae.


== Distribution et habitat ==
Cette espèce est endémique du centre-Nord de l'Amérique du Sud. Elle se rencontre :
en Guyane ;
au Suriname.
Elle vit dans les eaux calmes (zones calmes des ruisseaux à courant lent, mares profondes), généralement sur la litière de feuilles tapissant le fond.


== Comportement ==
Cette espèce est aquatique. Les œufs pondus sont placés sur le dos de la mère ; les petits ne seront libérés qu'après leur métamorphose.


== Statut de conservation ==
Les populations de cette espèce semblent à peu près stables, et certaines vivent dans des zones protégées. De fait, l'UICN a classé cet amphibien dans la catégorie ""LC"" (préoccupation mineure).

Cette chronologie tente de répertorier le plus exhaustivement possible tous les événements ayant un rapport avec Dada, depuis sa création en 1916, et le Surréalisme jusqu'en 1969, année de l'auto-dissolution du groupe surréaliste.
Chaque année se présente en trois parties :
« Éphémérides » pour l'énumération des faits datés au jour ou au mois,
« Cette année-là » pour les événements survenus dans le courant de l'année et dont le jour ou le mois, faute de source, reste à préciser,
« Œuvres » pour l'énumération des œuvres, soit présentées (en public ou en privé) pour la première fois (œuvres plastiques, spectacles), soit dont l'achèvement (voire le début d'exécution) est indiqué par un ouvrage de référence.
La citation d'une œuvre est faite dans la partie ""Éphémérides"" quand est connue :
pour un livre, la date d'""achevé d'imprimer"",
pour une revue, le jour de parution,
pour une œuvre plastique, la date du vernissage.

691,"Cap-Chat est une municipalité située dans la MRC de La Haute-Gaspésie, dans la région administrative de la Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine, au Québec, au Canada.
« La nouvelle ville de Cap-Chat a été créée le 15 mars 2000. Elle est issue du regroupement de la ville de Cap-Chat et de la municipalité de Capucins. »


== Histoire ==
Il existe deux théories quant à l'origine du nom de la localité. La première est toute simple : le Cap-Chat, rocher ressemblant à un chat selon certains, en serait la souche. D'ailleurs, selon une légende, un chat se promenant sur la grève, tuait et dévorait de nombreux animaux. La fée-chat, passant par là, l'accuse d'avoir dévoré sa progéniture et le transforme en rocher pour l'éternité. Par contre, l'hypothèse la plus plausible y voit la déformation du nom d'Aymar de Chaste, lieutenant général de la Nouvelle-France en 1603.

== Administration ==


== Démographie ==


== Économie ==
Cap-Chat est devenu synonyme d'énergie éolienne. On y trouve un parc de 76 éoliennes à axe horizontal exploitées sur une base commerciale. La plus belle vue du parc se trouve à l'ouest de la localité. À l'est du parc, se trouve Éole, la plus haute éolienne à axe vertical au monde (110 m). Un centre d'interprétation a été fondé pour en apprendre sur cette construction.


== Tourisme ==

Activités de loisirs : la pêche du saumon en rivière, les randonnées pédestres, le sentier international des Appalaches (SIA/IAT), la chasse de l'orignal ainsi qu'un sentier de quad.
Cap-Chat est situé tout près de l'ancien village de Saint-Octave-de-l'Avenir, fermé en 1971. Le film Chez nous, c'est chez nous relate cet événement.
Cap-Chat possède aussi d'autres attraits. Notons, entre autres le célèbre rocher en forme de chat, le phare et un havre de pêche.


== Loisirs ==
L'hiver, Cap-Chat possède un centre de ski alpin et des sentiers aménagés où il est possible de pratiquer le ski de randonnée, la raquette en plus de sentiers de motoneiges. Les amateurs de raquette et de ski Méta pourront profiter d'un sentier faisant le lien entre le sommet du mont 780 et le sentier de l'Épaule. Ce tronçon, très spectaculaire, s’ouvre sur des vues plongeantes à couper le souffle sur la vallée de la rivière Cap-Chat et le mont Frère-de-Nicol-Albert.

692,"Sarah Vaillancourt (née le 8 mai 1985 à Sherbrooke (Fleurimont) en Estrie dans la province du Québec) est une joueuse canadienne de hockey sur glace.


== Biographie ==
Vaillancourt commence à patiner à l'âge de deux ans et fait ses débuts au hockey à cinq ans. Jusqu'à 16 ans, elle joue dans une ligue de hockey avec des garçons. En 1998 à l'âge de 12 ans, elle voit du hockey féminin pour la première fois lors d'un match télévisé des Jeux olympiques de Nagano.


== Carrière en club ==


=== NCAA ===
Au niveau universitaire, Vaillancourt évolue cinq saisons (de 2004 à 2009) avec le Crimson de l'Université Harvard. En 2007-08, elle aide son équipe à participer au Frozen Four de la NCAA. Au chapitre des buts comptés, elle domine le classement à Harvard et occupe le quatrième rang de l'histoire du championnat féminin de la NCAA. En 2008, elle remporte le très convoité trophée Patty Kazmaier.


=== LCHF ===
Lors de sa première saison avec les Stars de Montréal (en 2010-11) dans la Ligue canadienne de hockey féminin, Vaillancourt rejoint l'équipe à la mi-saison (ceci en raison d'une déchirure du fascia à l'abdomen qui nécessite une intervention chirurgicale) et devient un élément clé de l'attaque. En plus de son style spectaculaire, elle se hisse parmi les dix meilleures compteuses de la Ligue canadienne de hockey féminin, avec une fiche de 28 points (11 buts et 17 passes) en 15 matchs. Dans le match de finale de la Coupe Clarkson 2011, Vaillancourt marque un but en troisième période pour donner aux Stars la suprématie du hockey féminin nord-américain.
Lors de la saison 2011-12, elle marque 10 buts et récolte 18 mentions d'assistance pour un total de 18 points en 14 maths, mais dû à une ancienne blessure à la hanche gauche, elle doit subir une opération chirurgical et manque le reste de la saison ainsi que le tournoi 2012 de la Coupe Clarkson.


== Carrière internationale ==
En 2003, Vaillancourt est la capitaine de l'équipe du Québec aux Jeux d'hiver du Canada. L'équipe remporte la médaille d'argent. Elle est également la capitaine de l'équipe du Canada des moins de 22 ans à la Coupe Air Canada 2007.
Elle débute avec l'équipe sénior canadienne en 2005 avec les championnats mondiaux féminins. Dans son premier match en carrière avec la sélection sénior, elle accumule 6 points (deux buts et 4 passes)dans une victoire de 13-0 sur l'équipe nationale du Kazakhstan. Elle termine la Coupe du monde 2005 avec 8 points.
Avec l'équipe du Canada de hockey sur glace féminin, elle est championne du monde en 2007 et vice -championne en 2005, 2008,2009 et en 2011. Elle obtient par deux fois la médaille d'or olympique, en 2006 à Turin et en 2010 à Vancouver.
En convalescence de son opération à la hanche, Vaillancourt rate le Championnat du monde de hockey sur glace féminin 2011 mais sera de retour pour la saison 2012-13.

695,"Sviatopolk Iziaslavitch (en russe : Святополк Изяславич et en ukrainien : Святополк Ізяславич), dit Sviatopolk II, est un Grand-prince du Rus' de Kiev de la dynastie des Riourikides (né vers 1050 et mort le 16 avril 1113 à Vychhorod), qui régna de 1093 à 1113.
Fils d'Iziaslav Ier et de Gertrude de Pologne, il est également prince de Novgorod de 1078 à 1088 et prince de Tourov de 1088 à 1093.
Peu populaire, sa vie est marquée tout au long de son règne par la rivalité et la lutte incessante entre lui et son cousin Vladimir II Monomaque.


== Biographie ==
Né en 1050, et fils d'Iziaslav Ier et peut-être de Gertrude de Pologne (épouse de son père), ou bien d'une esclave d'Iziaslav, il est baptisé du nom chrétien de « Michel ». Durant la vie de son frère Iaropolk, Sviatopolk n'est pas au départ considéré comme un futur héritier pour le trône de Kiev.
En 1069, il est envoyé à Polotsk, ville récemment prise par son père au prince local Vseslav, où il passe dix ans (de 1078 à 1088), dirigeant la ville de Novgorod. Après la mort de son frère, il devient maître de la ville de Tourov (qui resta en possession de ses descendants, les Ostrogski, jusqu'au XVIIe siècle).
Il devient grand prince de Kiev à la mort de Vsevolod Ier en 1093. En 1094, Sviatopolk avait conclu la paix avec les Polovtses et épousé la fille de leur prince Tougorkan.
En 1107, il écrase près de Loubny les Polovtses dirigés par Boniak et Sharukan.
Il meurt le 16 avril 1113 à Vychhorod (aujourd'hui oblast de Kiev). Il est inhumé à l'église Saint-Michel qu'il avait fondée en 1108. Après sa mort, les citoyens de Kiev mènent une rébellion contre les marchands juifs et les fonctionnaires varègues, qui spéculaient sur le prix du grain et du sel.


== Famille ==


=== Unions et descendance ===
Sviatopolk II se marie tout d'abord à une princesse de Bohême (de la dynastie des Přemyslides), avec qui il eut :
Zbysława, qui épouse (le 15 novembre 1102) Boleslas III Bouche-Torse, duc de Pologne.
Predslava, qui épouse (le 21 août 1104) le prince Almos de Hongrie.
Anna (meurt en 1136), qui épouse Sviatoslav Davydytch de Tchernihiv, et devient nonne après la mort de son mari.
Iaroslav (meurt en 1123), devient Prince de Volynia et de Tourov et se marie trois fois, à une hongroise, une polonaise et une princesse de Kiev.
En 1094, il se marie à nouveau à Olena, une fille du Khan Tugorkan des Polovtses, avec qui il eut:
Maria, qui épouse Piotr Włostowic, châtelain de Wrocław et palatin polonais.
Briatchislav (1104–1127), aurait peut-être pris le trône de Tourov à son demi-frère Iaroslav (de 1118 à 1123).
Iziaslav (meurt en 1127), Prince de Tourov supposé en 1123.
Certaines sources affirment que Sviatopolk eu également un autre fils hors-mariage, Mstislav, qui régna sur Novhorod-Siverskyï de 1095 à 1097, puis plus tard sur la Volhynie (de 1097 à 1099), avant d'être assassiné à Volodymyr-Volynskyï.

696,"Le panvitalisme est la théorie philosophique selon laquelle toute réalité possède une nature identique à celle qui caractérise le vivant. Dans sa version la plus radicale – celle qui identifie toute chose à une manifestation de la vie – le panvitalisme représente une version du spiritualisme. Parfois confondu avec la panpsychisme, le panvitalisme s'en distingue néanmoins par le fait que la vie n'implique pas nécessairement la conscience ou la vie psychique.
Dans le contexte particulier des théories vitalistes de la fin du XIXe siècle et du début du XXe siècle, le panvitalisme soutient que la vie est présente à chaque niveau de la réalité matérielle, y compris aux différents niveaux de la matière inorganique. Il conduit ainsi à un monisme de type « hylozoïste », comme chez Haeckel.


== Panvitalisme et Monisme chez Haeckel ==
Le panvitalisme de Ernst Haeckel est la contrepartie de son monisme : puisque rien d'autre que des composants inorganiques n'est révélé par l'analyse chimique la plus fine des organismes vivants, la vie doit habiter la matière inorganique au même titre (mais à un degré moindre) que la matière organique. Le panvitalisme s'oppose ainsi à la fois au matérialisme mécaniste qui considère que la vie n'est présente nulle part dans la nature, et au spiritualisme qui nie la réalité ou la spécificité de la matière. Haeckel définit ainsi son panvitalisme, qu'il qualifie d'hylozoïsme :
« Notre hylozoïsme évite ces deux extrêmes [matérialisme et spiritualisme], en admettant l'identité de la psyché et de la physis, au sens de Spinoza et de Goethe ; et il détourne les difficultés de cette doctrine d'identité en dissociant l'attribut de la pensée (ou de l'énergie) en deux attributs coordonnés, la sensibilité (psychoma) et le mouvement (mécanique) ».
Dès 1892, Haeckel affirme considérer « toute la matière comme animée, c'est-à-dire dotée de sensations (plaisir et douleur) et de mouvement. ». Il estime que toutes les créatures vivantes, microbes inclus, font preuve d'une « action psychique consciente ». En outre, il soutient que la matière inorganique a elle aussi un aspect mental, bien que « les qualités psychiques élémentaires de la sensation et de la volonté que l'on peut attribuer aux atomes sont inconscientes ». Cette position relève proprement du panvitalisme, qui, contrairement au panpsychisme, accepte l'idée d'une vie sans conscience.
Haeckel développe cette conception panvitaliste dans Les Merveilles de la vie : tout possède la vie à des degrés différents, même la matière brute.


== Panvitalisme et panpsychisme ==
Une synthèse entre panvitalisme et panpsychisme a été tentée par un certain nombre de biologistes, dont Haeckel au tournant du XXe siècle. Haeckel a introduit à cette fin la notion de « qualité psychique », qui peut être aussi bien inconsciente que consciente.
Parmi les biologistes contemporains, Sewall Wright soutient une position panvitaliste qui s'apparente au panpsychisme. Selon lui, « l'esprit humain n'est pas apparu par magie », mais doit être le produit du développement, depuis les particules élémentaires jusqu'à l'individu pensant. Il y a donc continuité entre les différents stades du développement, y compris entre les stades inorganiques et les niveaux conscients de la vie. Pour Wright, l'unique réponse satisfaisante à ce mystère est que l'esprit soit « universel, présent non seulement dans les organismes et leurs cellules, mais aussi dans les molécules, les atomes et les particules élémentaires ». L'identité entre la nature et l'esprit présuppose selon Wright une nature « proto-psychique » de la matière, identifiable à ce que l'on entend habituellement par « vie primitive » ou végétale.
Le biologiste Bernhard Rensch, de son côté, estime que rien ne permet de distinguer fondamentalement l'esprit de la matière. Selon lui, « il faut reconnaître que toute matière est protopsychique […] Il s'ensuit qu'il n'y a pas de différence de principe entre la réalité phénoménale et l'être, mais seulement deux systèmes de relations : celui qui entre dans le système de la conscience et celui qui demeure extra-mental ». Le problème de l'apparition de la vie est ainsi simplifié : la vie et l'esprit n'ont jamais réellement commencé. À l'origine de l'esprit, la vie a toujours été présente sous une certaine forme, aussi élémentaire soit-elle.

697,"La Batterie royale est une batterie érigée en 1691 sur la rive nord du fleuve Saint-Laurent, près de la place Royale, à Québec. Sa construction s'inscrit dans un vaste chantier de fortification de la ville commandé immédiatement après la levée du siège de 1690.


== Histoire ==


=== Construction initiale ===
Une première batterie de canons est disposée peu après 1660 près de la future batterie royale. Cependant, elle est jugée trop entourée par des bâtiments et éloignée de l'eau. Après le siège mené par les Britanniques en 1690, le gouverneur Louis de Buade de Frontenac commande la construction d'un bastion qui serait situé à la pointe aux Roches, alors une extrémité de la basse-ville face au fleuve Saint-Laurent. L'entrepreneur Claude Baillif est engagé pour mener ces travaux. L'ingénieur Robert de Villeneuve, à son retour à Québec, juge que « c'est un ouvrage qui a coûté plus de 12 000 livres, et qui ne vaut rien ». Cette plate-forme est entourée de 4 murs de pierre de Beauport composés de 14 embrasures et posés sur le roc. En 1695, l'ingénieur Jacques Levasseur de Néré commande déjà des réparations. En 1700, ce dernier mentionne que la batterie est menacée de ruine. Les réparations sont faites en 1702. D'autres travaux sont réalisés en 1730.


=== Tombée dans l'oubli puis restaurée ===

Lors du siège de 1759, la Batterie royale subit son premier et dernier assaut. Avec la victoire britannique, ce bastion est acheté par William Grant qui y fait construire des bâtiments. En 1785, un quai est bâti sur une partie du bastion et la grève au sud. En 1791, le terrain est allongé vers l'est de la même manière. La batterie royale est complètement ensevelie entre 1836 et 1840 avec la construction du marché Finlay.
Le 12 août 1967, la Loi concernant la Place Royale à Québec est sanctionnée et permet la mise en place d'un vaste projet de restauration historique de la basse-ville du Vieux-Québec. Les travaux de démolition des bâtiments situés sur les vestiges de la Batterie débutent en 1973. Les travaux de restauration débutent en mai 1976. Le déplacement de la rue Dalhousie a permis de créer un espace autour de la batterie afin de mieux s'imaginer sa position de jadis, quand le fleuve arrivait au pied de ses murs.
De nos jours, les Fêtes de la Nouvelle-France font revivre l'histoire de ce lieu chaque année.

698,"L'île Saint-Barnabé est une île de l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent, située dans la région du Bas-Saint-Laurent au Québec. Elle fait partie du territoire de la ville de Rimouski à laquelle elle fait face à une distance d'environ trois kilomètres des rives de la municipalité.


== Toponymie ==
Le toponyme de l'île est très ancien et déjà présent sur l'une des cartes de Samuel de Champlain en 1612. C’est probablement Champlain lui-même qui nomme l’île Saint-Barnabé au début du XVIIe siècle lorsqu’il la côtoie le 11 juin 1603, jour de la fête de Saint Barnabé lors d'un voyage exploratoire. Le nom de l'île apparaît alors sous la forme de «I. St Bernabe». Il se peut que l'origine du nom soit antérieur à 1612; Jacques Cartier ayant remarqué l'existence de l'île lors de son passage à cet endroit en août 1535.


== Géologie et morphologie ==
L'île Saint-Barnabé fait partie d'un chapelet de bandes de terre étroites émergées situées généralement près du littoral du Bas-Saint-Laurent. Cette série d'îles — l'île aux Lièvres, l'île Verte, l'île aux Basques, l'île du Bic et l'île Saint-Barnabé — sont apparues à la fin du Pléistocène, il y a quelques milliers d'années, lors du retrait de la mer de Goldthwait.
La morphologie de l'île est très longiligne, l'île mesurant près de cinq kilomètres de long, alors que sa largeur maximale est d'au plus 400 mètres. Son territoire est orienté du sud-ouest au nord-ouest, face à la ville de Rimouski. La formation géologique schisteuse caractérise l'île, mais des arêtes rocheuses affleurent aussi sur son rivage. Des battures de vases et de galets séparent l'île de la rive continentale.
Avec le cap du Rocher-Blanc et l'îlet Canuel au sud-ouest, le rivage sud de l'île Saint-Barnabé protège un léger rentrant du littoral où s'est bâti le centre-ville de Rimouski. Cet ensemble sert d'abri à une baie peu profonde, presque totalement découverte à marée basse, la baie de Rimouski. Cette baie a servi de havre à une certaine époque pour la navigation de faible tonnage, mais sa faible profondeur et une forte sédimentation forcent le déplacement des activités portuaires au nord-est, du côté de Pointe-au-Père.


== Milieu naturel ==
L'île fait partie de la zone importante pour la conservation des oiseaux (ZICO) du marais de Rimouski, pour sa concentration de sa population de sauvagines,. La ZICO a une superficie de 47,71 km2 et un territoire qui correspond à la côte sud du fleuve Saint-Laurent entre le secteur du Rocher-Blanc en amont et Pointe-au-Père à l'aval. Il comprend la baie de Rimouski, l'île Canuel et la réserve nationale de faune de Pointe-au-Père. L'une de principale caractéristique de la ZICO est la présence d'un marais en gradient, unique dans l'est du Québec, ce qui offre une grande variété d'habitats, comme des côtes rocheuses, des vasières, des marais salés, des plages et des herbiers à zostère.


=== Flore ===


=== Faune ===

Le Grand Héron (Ardea herodias) est l'oiseau emblématique de l'île Saint-Barnabé.


== Histoire ==
Des sources mentionnent que le père Henri Nouvel, accompagné d'un groupe d'amérindiens s'est arrêté à l'île Saint-Barbabé le 8 décembre 1663, en route vers un voyage de chasse à l'intérieur des terres de ce territoire de l'est de la Nouvelle-France. D'autres sources mentionnent plutôt que le père Nouvel s'est arrêté à la Pointe-au-Père où il aurait célébré une messe.
L'île Saint-Barnabé fait partie du territoire de la seigneurie de Rimouski concédé par le gouverneur Jacques-René de Brisay à Augustin Rouer de la Cardonnière le 24 avril 1688. Le 18 avril 1746, l'administration de la Nouvelle-France charge René-Ovide-Hertel, sieur de Rouville, de la gestion d'un poste d'observation situé sur l'île dans le but de signaler la présence de tous navires remontant le fleuve Saint-Laurent.


== Excursions touristiques ==

L'île est maintenant une destination touristique et pendant la période estivale, de juin à septembre, l'office du tourisme de Rimouski y organise des excursions,. Les visiteurs peuvent y observer la faune, (présence de grand hérons et de phoques), et y pratiquer la randonnée pédestre. Le déplacement entre Rimouski et l'île s'effectue en zodiac.
Il est possible de camper sur le site depuis l'aménagement de 12 sites de camping rustique chacun dotés d'une plate-forme, d'une table de pique-nique et d'un foyer pour allumer des feux. Le camping est situé à une demi-heure de marche du point d'accueil de l'île.
Plusieurs autres activités sont également proposées aux visiteurs. Douze géocaches ont été éparpillées dans différents endroits. Il est aussi possible de s'arrêter pour pique-niquer ou de s'informer à des haltes thématiques aménagées et qui abordent différentes facettes du milieu naturel, de l'occupation humaine des lieux et de l'histoire locale.


== La légende de Toussaint Cartier ==
Au XVIIe siècle, l’île est habitée par Toussaint Cartier, un ermite, dont l’histoire est encore aujourd’hui enveloppée de mystère. Selon l’historienne Marie-Andrée Massicotte, les faits historiques sont les suivants : En 1728, Toussaint Cartier, alors âgé d’une vingtaine d’années, arrive à Rimouski et demande au seigneur Lepage, la permission de se retirer sur l’île Saint-Barnabé afin d’y vivre en ermite. Sa requête ayant été acceptée, l’ermite s’installe vers le milieu de l’île, du côté sud, où il se construit une cabane et une petite étable. Il tire subsistance de la culture d’un lopin de terre et de l’élevage de quelques animaux domestiques, « Il traversait quelquefois à Rimouski pour assister aux offices religieux de la mission et, s’il gardait le silence sur lui-même, il savait se montrer agréable dans ses échanges avec les Rimouskois. »
Toussaint Cartier meurt le 30 janvier 1767. Dans un livre intitulé « The History of Emily Montague », publié à Londres en 1769, la romancière Frances Brooke imagine une histoire romanesque autour du personnage de Toussaint Cartier. Cette fiction contribuera à fausser la vérité sur ce personnage et à créer la légende.

700,"Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas Thomas de Pange (1727-1774), ou Thomas de Domangeville, est un général français du règne de Louis XV.


== Biographie ==
Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas naît le 13 novembre 1727 à Metz dans les Trois-Évêchés. Son père Jean-Baptiste-Louis Thomas Seigneur puis marquis de Pange (1688-1769), qui était trésorier de l’extraordinaire des guerres et avait épousé en 1716 Françoise de Thumery (1686-1752), avec qui il avait eu six enfants, avait fait construire en 1720 le château de Pange. Son frère aîné, le 2d marquis de Pange Jean-Baptiste-François (1717-1780), sera nommé grand-bailli d'épée de la ville de Metz en 1773.
Comme simple cornette, le futur baron de Mareuil entre au régiment de cavalerie de La Rochefoucauld le 5 mai 1748, à la fin de la guerre de Succession d'Autriche. Le 21 juin de la même année, il est promu capitaine et commande une compagnie. En 1749, il est promu « maréchal des logis des armées du roi ». En novembre 1750, Thomas de Pange de Domangeville est nommé « mestre de cavalerie », soit commandant de régiment. Le 7 janvier 1754, Thomas de Pange de Domangeville reçoit la croix de chevalier de l'Ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis.
Au début de la Guerre de Sept Ans, en mars 1757, Thomas de Pange est nommé « aide-maréchal général des logis » de l’armée d'Allemagne, soit aide-major général. Au cours de la guerre, en février 1761, il est promu « brigadier des armées du Roi », puis « maréchal de camp », soit général de brigade, le 25 juillet 1762.
Il épouse Marie-Pauline Josèphe Chalvet de Rochemonteix (1744-1774) dans la chapelle du château de Vernassal (Léotoing) le 25 mars 1761. Elle est la fille d’Henri Chalvet de Rochemonteix (1718-1745), officier général des armées du roi. Par ce mariage, Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas hérite des terres de Champagne et du Château de Mareuil. Ils ont quatre enfants :

Anne-Marie-Louise Thomas de Domangeville (1762-1799) épouse en 1779 Antoine Mégret, comte de Sérilly (1746-guillotiné en 1794), en 1796 François Thomas de Pange, comte de Pange dit le chevalier de Pange (1764-1796) en 1798 Anne-Pierre de Montesquiou-Fézensac, marquis de Montesquiou (1739-1798)
Jean-Baptiste Antoine François Thomas de Domangeville (1763-guillotiné en 1794)
Amédée Thomas de Domangeville (1764-1777)
Anne-Pauline Thomas de Domangeville (1765-1786) épouse Jean-Baptiste Chastel de Boinville
Ayant des problèmes de santé, Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas Thomas de Pange quitte le service actif pour se retirer au château de Mareuil, près de Reims, où il décède prématurément le 29 août 1774  à l'âge de 46 ans après avoir confié l'éducation de ses enfants à son frère, le marquis de Pange.
Malade, son épouse le suit de peu dans la tombe.

=== Heat de Miami (2003-2004) ===
Arrivant à la fin de son contrat avec les Clippers, il décide de signer au Heat de Miami avec un contrat de six ans et 65 millions de dollars. Odom qui commençait à végéter avec les Clippers réalise une très bonne saison en Floride avec en moyenne 17,1 points, 9,7 rebonds et 4,1 passes par rencontre. Cette belle saison personnelle est à l'unisson de celle de Miami qui, avec un très jeune effectif (Caron Butler, Dwyane Wade), réussit à atteindre les play-offs et même à rivaliser avec les meilleurs.


=== Lakers de Los Angeles (2004-2011) ===

À la fin de cette saison prometteuse, Miami décide de réorganiser son équipe pour obtenir le pivot Shaquille O'Neal. Cela passe par le transfert d'Odom avec Caron Butler et Brian Grant vers les Lakers de Los Angeles.
Odom débarque aux Lakers aux côtés de la star Kobe Bryant. La première saison est catastrophique (pas de play-offs) malgré de bonnes statistiques (15,2 points et 10,2 rebonds par match en 64 rencontres). La saison suivante, Odom complète son jeu avec Phil Jackson au poste d'entraîneur. Il réussit des statistiques équilibrées : 14,8 points, 9,3 rebonds et 5,5 passes décisives par match avec un temps de jeu moyen de 40,3 minutes. Les Lakers sont éliminés des play-off en 7 rencontres par les Suns de Phoenix. La saison 2006-2007 ressemble à la précédente : Odom augmente légèrement ses statistiques personnelles mais les Lakers sont toujours éliminés au premier tour par les Suns. Lors de la saison 2007-2008 le pivot Kwame Brown est envoyé aux Grizzlies de Memphis en échange de la star ibérique Pau Gasol pour remplacer Andrew Bynum blessé. Les deux intérieurs s'entendent bien et Odom enregistre le second double-double de moyenne dans sa carrière. Les Lakers vont en finale NBA où ils se font battre par les Celtics de Boston en 6 manches.
Lors de la saison 2008-2009, Odom apparaît au camp d'entraînement de pré-saison hors de forme. L'entraîneur Phil Jackson le critique et décide de le placer sur le banc. Lors des premiers mois, Odom apporte un plus en sortant du banc mais ses statistiques sont en baisse avec son temps de jeu limité. À la suite de la nouvelle blessure du pivot Andrew Bynum, Gasol devient pivot titulaire et Odom intérieur titulaire. Ensemble, ils mènent, aux côtés de Kobe Bryant, l'équipe jusqu'au titre NBA après une série victorieuse face au Magic d'Orlando (4 victoires à une) en finales NBA. La saison suivante il remporta le titre NBA une seconde fois avec les Lakers et remporta aussi le titre de sixième homme de l'année. Son année la plus complète avec de très bonne finales contre les Celtics dans une revanche de la finale de 2008.
Lamar Odom est membre de l'équipe de basket aux Jeux olympiques d'Athènes en 2004. Il fait partie de la première équipe composée de joueurs NBA à perdre un match aux Jeux olympiques. En dépit de tous ses efforts, Lamar Odom ne remporte que la médaille de bronze.


=== Mavericks de Dallas (2011-2012) ===
En 2011, après la fin du lockout et la reprise des transferts Lamar Odom est envoyé dans l'équipe des champions en titre, les Dallas Mavericks, contre 8,9 millions de dollars et quelques tours de draft.


=== Clippers de Los Angeles (2012-2013) ===
Le 29 juin 2012, il s'engage officiellement avec les Clippers de Los Angeles le club de ses débuts.


=== Saski Baskonia (début 2014) ===
Le 18 février 2014, il signe en Espagne, à Vitoria-Gasteiz pour le Saski Baskonia Laboral Kutxa et s'engage pour deux mois en remplacement de Lamont Hamilton. Il rejoint ainsi l'ancien joueur NBA, Andrés Nocioni et les Français Thomas Heurtel et Fabien Causeur. Lors de son premier match avec l'équipe espagnole, il prend un rebond, fait une passe décisive et contre un ballon en six minutes de jeu ; il ne peut empêcher la défaite des siens contre Málaga pour le compte de la 8e journée du Top 16 de l'Euroligue. Mais, le 12 mars, il revient aux États-Unis pour soigner ses problèmes aux lombaires et ainsi consulter un spécialiste du dos.


=== Knicks de New York ===
Le 16 avril 2014, dernier jour de la saison régulière, Odom signe un contrat de deux ans avec les Knicks de New York,. En juillet, son contrat est résilié par la franchise new-yorkaise.


== Vie privée ==
Lamar Odom a eu 3 enfants avec Liza Morales : Destiny, L.J., et Jayden. Ce dernier est mort, le 29 juin 2006, à l'âge de 6 mois et demi de suffocation en plein sommeil.
En 2005, lui et le rappeur Ali Vegas fondent le label Rich Soil Entertainment, qui fit sortir le premier album d'Ali Vegas.
Il s'est marié le 27 septembre 2009 avec la star de télé réalité américaine Khloé Kardashian. Il est accusé de consommer des produits stupéfiants. En décembre 2013, Khloé Kardashian demande le divorce. En juillet 2015, les papiers du divorce ont enfin été signés.
Lamar Odom a eu une enfance difficile : son père, accro à l'héroïne, l'a abandonné et il a vu sa mère mourir d'un cancer du côlon à l'âge de 12 ans. Le basket devient alors la raison de vivre de Lamar pour faire oublier son mal-être. Malheureusement pour lui les épreuves se succèdent : il perd sa grand-mère qui l'a élevé en 2004, et en 2006, son troisième enfant avec son ex Liza Morales meurt de la mort subite du nourrisson. De plus, un de ses cousins est assassiné en 2010 et en se rendant à ses funérailles, il se retrouve sur le siège passager d'une voiture qui écrase un garçon de 15 ans. En juin 2015, il perd deux de ses plus proches amis, décédés à une semaine d'intervalle.
Retrouvé inconscient le 13 octobre 2015 dans une maison close du Nevada après avoir absorbé de la cocaïne et substances développant les performances sexuelles, il reste dans le coma durant trois jours. Le 21 octobre 2015 Khloé et lui annoncent qu'ils ont décidé d'annuler leur divorce.

708,"Hymenophyllum cruentum est une fougère de la famille des Hyménophyllacées.


== Position taxinomique et historique ==
Hymenophyllum cruentum appartient au sous-genre Hymenoglossum.
Cette espèce est décrite une première fois en 1802 par Antonio José Cavanilles à partir d'un exemplaire collecté au Chili à San Carlos par Louis Née.
En 1843, Karel Bořivoj Presl place cette espèce dans le genre Hymenoglossum : Hymenoglossum cruentum (Cav.) C.Presl.
En 2006, Atsushi Ebihara, Jean-Yves Dubuisson, Kunio Iwatsuki, Sabine Hennequin et Motomi Ito prennent Hymenophyllum cruentum comme espèce représentative du genre Hymenophyllum, sous-genre Hymenoglossum.
Cette espèce a un synonyme : Hymenoglossum cruentum (Cav.) C.Presl (1843).


== Description ==
Le rhizome est fin et long.
Les frondes, de 10 à 20 cm de long sur 5 à 10 cm de larges ont un limbe simple entier, ovale-lancéolé ou deltoïde-lancéolé. Le pétiole est à peu près de la taille du limbe. Les bords du limbe sont légèrement dentelés.
Les nervures du limbe sont marquées et, pour certaines variétés, violacées comme des veines (d'où son nom en Espagnol : « Sanginaria »). Le limbe séché prend une couleur brun-pourpre.
Les sores sont localisés sur les dentelures en bordure du limbe, entre deux lèvres épaissies.
Le nombre de base de chromosomes est de 36.


== Habitat - distribution ==
Cette fougère est originaire des forêts humides d'Amérique du Sud - Chili, Archipel Juan Fernández, Patagonie - où elle est principalement épiphyte des troncs d'arbres. Elle peut supporter occasionnellement des températures de -5°C.

718,"René Armand François Prudhomme, dit Sully Prudhomme (orthographié également parfois Sully-Prudhomme), né à Paris le 16 mars 1839 et mort à Châtenay-Malabry le 6 septembre 1907, est un poète français, premier lauréat du prix Nobel de littérature en 1901.


== Biographie ==
Né au 34 rue du Faubourg Poissonnière. Fils d'un employé de commerce mort alors qu'il était encore enfant, René Armand Prudhomme, qui souhaite devenir ingénieur, fait ses études au lycée Bonaparte (aujourd'hui Condorcet), mais une crise d'ophtalmie le contraint à les interrompre. Après avoir travaillé au Creusot (Saône-et-Loire), dans les usines Schneider, de 1858 à 1860 (il était ami d'Henri Schneider, avec qui il avait fait ses études au lycée Bonaparte), il se tourne vers le droit et travaille chez un notaire. L'accueil favorable réservé à ses premiers poèmes au sein de la Conférence La Bruyère, société étudiante dont il est membre, encourage ses débuts littéraires.
Son premier recueil, Stances et Poèmes (1865), est loué par Sainte-Beuve et lance sa carrière. Il renferme son poème le plus célèbre, Le Vase brisé, élégante métaphore du cœur brisé par un chagrin d'amour :

Au fil de sa carrière, Sully Prudhomme se détourne progressivement du genre sentimental de ce premier recueil — qu'on retrouvera encore dans Les Épreuves (1866) et Les Solitudes (1869) — pour adopter un style plus personnel alliant une recherche formelle qui le rattache au Parnasse (il contribue au Parnasse contemporain de Leconte de Lisle) avec un intérêt pour les sujets scientifiques et philosophiques. Il donne notamment une traduction en vers du premier chant du De Natura Rerum de Lucrèce (1878-79). Son ambition philosophique s'exprime dans des poèmes comme La Justice (1878) et Le Bonheur (1888). Il est élu membre de l'Académie française en 1881.
Son éditeur, Alphonse Lemerre, commande au peintre Paul Chabas (1869-1937), une vaste composition peinte représentant tous les poètes du Parnasse que Lemerre édite. Ce tableau, Chez Alphonse Lemerre, à Ville D'Avray a été exposé au salon de 1895 et représente, autour de Sully-Prudhomme, Paul Bourget, Alphonse Daudet, Leconte de Lisle, Jules Breton ou Daniel Lesueur (nom de plume de Jeanne Loiseau). La toile a pour cadre le jardin de la propriété que l'éditeur a achetée au père de Camille Corot en 1875.
Après Le Bonheur, Sully Prudhomme délaisse la poésie pour s'intéresser exclusivement à l'esthétique et à la philosophie. Il publie deux essais d'esthétique : L'Expression dans les beaux-arts (1884) et Réflexions sur l'art des vers (1892), une suite d'articles sur Blaise Pascal dans la Revue des deux Mondes (1890), Le Problème des causes finales en collaboration avec Charles Richet (1902), un article sur « La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre » dans la Revue de métaphysique et de morale (1906).
Premier écrivain à recevoir le prix Nobel de littérature, le 10 décembre 1901,,, il consacre l'essentiel de la somme reçue à cette occasion à fonder un prix de poésie décerné par la Société des gens de lettres. Il crée par ailleurs en 1902 la Société des poètes français avec José-Maria de Heredia et Léon Dierx. Il est l'un des premiers partisans de Dreyfus.
Sa santé avait été durablement ébranlée par la guerre de 1870. Sur la fin de sa vie, elle le contraignait à vivre quasiment reclus à Châtenay-Malabry (département de la Seine), souffrant d'attaques de paralysie et travaillant à La Vraie Religion selon Pascal (1905). Mort subitement le 6 septembre 1907, il est inhumé au cimetière du Père-Lachaise (44e division) à Paris. Il avait fait de son neveu Henry Gerbault (1863-1930) son légataire universel.

719,"Chain Home / AMES TYPE 1 (Air Ministry Experimental Station, pouvant se traduire en français par Station expérimentale du Ministère de l'Air) était le nom de code pour la chaîne côtière de stations radar construite par les Britanniques avant et pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Le système comprenait deux types de radars : les stations Chain Home métriques, qui fournissaient des alertes radar à longue portée, et les stations Chain Home Low / AMES TYPE 2 centimétriques, de plus courte portée, mais qui pouvaient détecter les aéronefs à basse altitude.


== Système Chain Home ==


=== Origine ===
En 1933, le Ministère de l'Air britannique (Air Ministry) mettait sur pied un comité pour la modernisation de la défense aérienne du Royaume-Uni. Durant la Première Guerre mondiale, les allemands avaient utilisés des Zeppelins comme bombardiers à longue portée et leur interception par des avions s'était avéré un désastre, seule la DCA avait fonctionné. Même si les Zeppelins mesuraient des centaines de mètres de longueur et se déplaçaient à seulement 100 km/h, les intercepteurs ne purent les apercevoir que trois fois sur vingt sorties et ne furent jamais capables de les attaquer.
Les bombardiers développés depuis la guerre pouvaient maintenant voler au-dessus de la portée des canons de DCA, ce qui constituait une grande menace. Pire, les aérodromes ennemis n'étaient qu'à 20 minutes de vol ce qui leur permettrait de faire leur raid et d'être repartis avant que les intercepteurs ne puissent intervenir. La seule solution était d'avoir une escadre de chasseurs en permanence en vol ce qui était physiquement impossible à l'époque. Il fallait donc trouver un autre moyen. Le 12 février 1935, Robert Watson-Watt envoya un mémo du système proposé au Air Ministry intitulé Detection and location of aircraft by radio methods. Le concept avait un potentiel important et on lui demanda immédiatement une démonstration. Dès le 26 février, il avait mis sur pied deux antennes à environ 10 km d'une antenne onde-courte de la BBC à Daventry. Dans le plus grand secret, Watson-Watt, son assistant Arnold Wilkins et un seul membre du comité A.P. Rowe, assistent à la démonstration qui permit de repérer un bombardier à plusieurs occasions avec le signal émis. Fait plus important, le premier ministre, Stanley Baldwin, se tenait informé des progrès du développement du radar.
Deux semaines plus tard, Wilkins quitta la Radio Research Station avec un petit groupe, dont Edward George Bowen, pour continuer la recherche à Orfordness. Le 2 avril 1935, Watson-Watt obtint un brevet pour le système radar (brevet britannique GB593017,). Dès juin, son équipe pouvait détecter un avion à 27 kilomètres, ce qui était assez loin pour cesser tout développement sur des systèmes compétiteurs à écholocation sonore. À la fin de la même année, la portée était déjà de 100 km et en décembre, les plans pour cinq stations couvrant l'approche de Londres étaient déjà prêts.
Une de ces stations serait située près sur la côte près de Orfordness et Bawdsey Research Station fut érigé là pour servir de centre principal de recherche sur le radar. Rapidement, des tests à grande échelle du système, plus tard connu sous le nom de code « Chain Home », furent entrepris pour détecter et intercepter un bombardier par détection radar. L'essai fut un échec, non à cause de la détection radar mais à cause du problème de communiquer l'information à temps. Les chasseurs furent lancés trop tard et ne virent leur cible qu'après que le bombardier eût dépassé la zone de bombardement. Watson-Watt s'attaqua immédiatement à ce problème en organisant un système de détection par paliers successifs. Les rapports aboutissent dans la « War room » où des observateurs indiquent sur une large carte la position de l'ennemi et des coordonnateurs relaient l'information aux escadrons de chasseurs par communications herztiennes directes.
En 1937, les premières stations étaient opérationnelles et le système mis à l'épreuve. Les résultats furent concluants et vingt autres stations furent commandées. Au début de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, dix-neuf étaient construites et prêtes à assumer un rôle décisif dans la Bataille d'Angleterre, en 1940 où elles se sont avérées capables de donner des alertes avancées des raids de la Luftwaffe. Les stations Chain Home ont été construites le long de la côte britannique, au début au sud et à l'est de l'Angleterre, puis sur l'ensemble de la côte, y compris sur les Shetland. Il y avait cinquante stations à la fin de la guerre.


=== Description ===

La Chain Home ne ressemble en rien à l'image habituelle d'un radar. Elle ne comportait pas d'antenne en rotation émettant et recevant le retour des cibles. Il s'agissait plutôt d'un radar bistatique avec un transmetteur distinct formé d'un réseau de fils électriques tendus entre des tours mesurant 110 m de hauteur qui émettaient sur un angle 100° de largeur , et de deux tours en bois de 73 m supportant des antennes réceptrice orientées à 90 degrés l'une de l'autre.
La façon de connaître la position des cibles était similaire à l’utilisation d’un radiogoniomètre : orienter manuellement en azimut et en élévation les antennes réceptrices. En azimut, l'opérateur comparait alors la puissance relative des signaux venant des deux antennes jusqu'à ce qu'il trouve la direction où le signal était maximal. De façon similaire, il comparait en élévation le signal provenant d'une antenne au sommet et d'une autre à la base des tours. La distance provenait du délai entre l'émission et le temps de retour des échos depuis les cibles.
Les stations de la Chain Home opéraient à une fréquence variable entre 20 et 50 MHz, soit à la limite entre la haute fréquence et la très haute fréquence. Le plus souvent c'est la gamme de 20 à 30 MHz qui était utilisée mais la possibilité de varier sur une large plage de fréquences permettait en partie de contrer le brouillage.
La portée habituelle était de 190 km mais pouvait parfois dépasser ce seuil. Les transmetteurs furent construits par Metropolitan-Vickers à partir des plans du transmetteur du poste de radio de Rugby. Le récepteur fut construit par A. C. Cossor Ltd, selon les plans donnés par le Telecommunications Research Establishment.


=== Déploiement ===

Les Allemands connaissaient la construction de la Chain Home mais ne savaient pas vraiment son utilité. Ils testèrent leurs théories sur le sujet en envoyant le GRAF Zeppelin II (Zeppelin LZ130). De mai à août 1939, le ballon dirigeable allemand a fait des vols le long de la côte de Grande-Bretagne, en vue de confirmer la théorie que les tours de 100m de haut édifiées par les Britanniques de Portsmouth à Scapa Flow étaient utilisées pour la localisation par radio des avions. Le LZ130 a fait un ensemble de tests, allant de l'interception d'émissions radio à la prise de photos, en passant par une analyse de fréquences magnétiques et radio. Cependant, la mauvaise qualité de l'équipement allemand les a empêché de détecter les radars Chain Home britanniques, et la mission LZ130 en a conclu que les tours britanniques n'étaient pas liées à des opérations radar, mais formaient plutôt un réseau de radiocommunications et sauvetage navals.
Le système Chain Home était très primitif, et, pour être prêt au combat, il a été mis en production en urgence par Robert Watson-Watt. Cet ingénieur pragmatique considérait que la « troisième qualité » va, à condition que la «deuxième qualité» ne puisse pas être produite à temps, et que la « première qualité » ne soit jamais disponible. Chain Home était certainement de « troisième qualité » et souffrait de bruits et d'erreurs de détection. Mais c'était quand même le meilleur au monde à l'époque, et il fournit une information critique, sans laquelle la bataille d'Angleterre aurait pu être perdue.

Pendant la bataille, les stations de Chain Home, et tout particulièrement celle de Ventnor sur l'île de Wight, ont été attaquées de nombreuses fois entre le 12 et le 18 août 1940. Il est arrivé un jour qu’une section de la chaîne dans le Kent, dont la station de Douvres, soit mise hors d'état par un coup de chance endommageant le réseau électrique. Mais, bien que les huttes en bois recélant l'équipement radar soient endommagées, les tours ont survécu grâce à leur robuste construction en poutrelles d'acier. Comme les tours sont restées intactes et que les signaux ont rapidement été remis en route, la Luftwaffe a conclu que les stations étaient trop difficiles à endommager par bombardement, et les a laissées tranquilles pour le reste de la guerre. Si la Luftwaffe avait réalisé à quel point ces stations radar étaient essentielles à la défense aérienne britannique, il est probable qu'elle aurait mis toutes ses ressources pour les détruire.
Le système Chain Home a été détruit après la guerre, mais certaines des grandes tours d'acier restent, reconverties pour de nouveaux usages pour le XXIe siècle.
L'une de ces tours émettrices de 110 m de haut (voir photo à droite) se trouve à l'usine BAE Systems de Great Baddow en Essex (2003). Elle était initialement à Canewdo, et on prétend que c'est que la seule tour de Chain Home encore dans son état d'origine, sans modification.

== Radars allemands ==


=== Comparaison avec le radar Freya allemand ===

Les premiers tests de ce qui deviendra le radar d'alerte précoce Freya ont lieu dans les premiers mois de 1937. La première livraison d'une station opérationnelle à la Marine par la firme GEMA a lieu en 1938. Apparemment le développement des radars en Allemagne est nettement moins prioritaire qu'il ne le sera le cas en Grande-Bretagne. Le radar Freya est pourtant déjà bien plus évolué du point de vue technique que son équivalent britannique. Il utilise une longueur d'onde de 1,2 m, alors que Chain home fonctionne sur une longueur d'onde de 12 m. Ceci augmente de façon drastique la résolution de Freya, ainsi que son pouvoir de détection d'objets bien plus petits, il diminue également l'encombrement des antennes.
Cependant, en raison du coût de sa construction il n'y a au début de la guerre que huit appareils Freya en service, qui ne peuvent fournir qu'une couverture très limitée des territoires à surveiller. De construction plus simple, mais plus enclin aux erreurs, le radar britannique Chain Home est bien plus rapide à installer que le système Freya, si bien que l'ensemble du système Chain Home est complètement opérationnel au moment de la bataille d'Angleterre.


=== Petit parasite de Heidelberg ===
Les Allemands déploient ensuite un système de radar très simple, le « petit parasite de Heidelberg », qui leur permet de suivre les avions britanniques à la trace, en utilisant les signaux des radars britanniques du Chain Home. Le caractère « en éventail » des émissions de Chain Home leur procure une paire de signaux qui leur permet de localiser les avions. Le signal primaire est le signal direct en provenance de l'émetteur de Chain Home vers le récepteur allemand. Le second signal, plus faible, est celui qui est réfléchi sur l'avion. Le délai entre ces deux signaux donne la différence entre le chemin direct et le chemin réfléchi. Cette différence donne géométriquement une ellipse sur laquelle se trouve l'avion. Les foyers de l'ellipse sont les antennes émettrice et réceptrice, dont les positions sont connues par les Allemands. Une simple antenne directionnelle recherchant la direction de l'écho permet de donner le point de l'ellipse où se trouve l'avion. Ce système donne aux Allemands un radar de 400 km de portée, avec de 1 à 2 km de précision en distance et un degré en azimut.


== Prologue ==
Pour sa contribution à l'effort de guerre par le développement de la Chain Home, Robert Watson-Watt fut fait Chevalier en 1942. En 1952, 50 000 livres lui furent décernées par le gouvernement britannique pour sa contribution au développement du radar. Il passa une bonne partie de sa vie d'après-guerre, d'abord au Canada puis aux États-Unis où il publia Three Steps to Victory en 1958.

722,"La Grande-Moravie (en slave Velká Morava ou Svätoplukova ríša, en latin Moravia Magna) était un royaume slave. De 833 jusqu'au début du Xe siècle, il s'étendit sur les territoires des actuelles République tchèque, Allemagne orientale, Slovaquie et Hongrie nord-occidentale, le sud de la Pologne avec la région de Cracovie et l'ouest de l'Ukraine avec la Galicie. Le premier usage du terme « Grande-Moravie » remonte à l'ouvrage de Constantin VII Porphyrogénète De Administrando Imperio (écrit aux alentours de 950). Le terme « Moravia » renvoyait non seulement à la région correspondant à l'actuelle Moravie mais aussi aux territoires autour de la rivière Morava ou de sa capitale appelée Morava, dont l'emplacement reste actuellement inconnu (peut-être se trouve-t-elle sous une grande ville actuelle telle Brno, Nitra ou Bratislava).


== Développement ==

Le royaume de Samo aux alentours de 623–658 était probablement l'un des prédécesseurs de la Grande-Moravie. Il se situait en Moravie, Slovaquie, Basse-Autriche, peut-être en Bohême et Sorabie sur l'Elbe. Ce n'était sans doute pas un royaume institué mais une confédération de peuples.
L'histoire de la région entre 659 et la fin du VIIIe siècle est en grande partie inconnue.
À la fin du VIIIe siècle, le bassin morave et la Slovaquie de l'Ouest, aux marches de l'Empire franc commencent à se développer. En 791 ou 795, les Slaves au Nord du Danube secouent le joug avar profitant de la guerre entre les Francs et les Avars. S'ensuivent une centralisation du pouvoir et la création d'un état structuré réunissant les Slaves de cette région.
Deux principautés émergent alors : celle de Moravie centrée sur la Moravie actuelle et l'ouest extrême de la Slovaquie, gouvernée par le prince Mojmir I, dont le siège était probablement Mikulčice et la principauté de Nitra (reste de la Slovaquie), gouvernée par le prince Pribina de Nitra et dont la capitale était Nitra.
Ce que les historiens depuis Porphyrogénète appellent la Grande-Moravie est l'empire né de l'invasion par Mojmir Ier (833–846) de la principauté de Nitra. Il passe ensuite à Rastislav (846-870), Slavomir (871), Svätopluk (871-894) et Mojmir II (894-?). Rastislav a demandé à l'Empereur de Byzance de lui envoyer des missionnaires qui pussent transmettre en langue vernaculaire l'enseignement du Christ. Deux de ces interprètes, Cyrille et Méthode sont les fondateurs de l'alphabet slavon et, par conséquent, de la littérature slavone (voir alphabet glagolitique) ; leur disciple Clément est l'inventeur véritable de l'alphabet « cyrillique ».


== Territoire ==


== Dates clés ==
828 – Pribina, le premier prince de Nitra donne son consentement pour l'érection d'une église chrétienne à Nitra, consécration par l'archevêque Adalram de Salzbourg. Cette église était la première église chrétienne des Slaves de l'Ouest et de l'Est.
833 – Le prince slave Mojmir I consolide en un même état les principautés de Moravie et de Nitra créant ce que les historiens nomment la Grande-Moravie. Pribina, dépossédé de sa principauté, se réfugie chez les Francs. Louis le Germanique lui accorde la principauté de Balaton.
863 ou 864 – Sur invitation du prince Rastislav, deux frères byzantins, les missionnaires Constantin et Methodius (Saint Cyrille et Saint Méthode) arrivent en Grande-Moravie. La stratégie de Rastislav était de contrer l'influence franque en gagnant la reconnaissance impériale byzantine. Saint Cyrille met au point le premier alphabet slave et traduit les évangiles en vieux slave marquant ainsi la naissance de la littérature slave.
871 – Svätopluk défend la souveraineté et l'indépendance de la Grande-Moravie contre les attaques des Francs et devient le nouveau maître de l'empire après avoir été prince de Nitra. Jusqu'à sa mort en 894 le Pape s'adresse à lui comme à son « dilectus filius » dans sa correspondance, un titre réservé jusqu'alors aux empereurs Francs ou Byzantins.
880 – Le Pape Jean VIII publie la Bulle Industriae Tuae qui institue la province ecclésiastique de Grande-Moravie dont Méthode prend la tête en tant qu'archévêque. Il nomme également le clerc allemand Wiching évêque de Nitra et reconnait le vieux-slave comme langue liturgique au même titre que l'hébreu, le latin et le grec.
890 – Svätopluk annexe la Bohême et une partie de l'Allemagne à son empire. Apogée de l'Empire.
896 – Après la mort de Svätopluk, ses fils Mojmir II et Svätopluk II se querellent pour la domination de l'empire. Les Magyars, autre nom des Hongrois, prennent avantage de la situation et envahissent le bassin du Danube. Mojmir II et Svätopluk II meurent probablement dans des batailles contre les Magyars entre 904 et 907.
907 – Les Magyars mettent les Bavarois en déroute dans trois batailles se déroulant autour de Bratislava. Pour différentes raisons, les historiens datent de cette date la fin de l'empire Grand-Morave.
Après 907 – Le destin de la principauté morave et de la partie Nord de l'empire est peu clair. La partie slovaque est envahie en 925 par le Magyar Lehel (Lél) et passe sous le joug de la dynastie hongroise des Arpad en 955.
990 – Échange de populations avec l'Empire byzantin: une partie des Serbes de la Serbie blanche (aujourd'hui Sorabes) s'installent au sud du Danube, dans le bassin du Margos qu'ils nomment Morava, à la place des Valaques chassés de cette région par la conquête de l'empereur Basile II, qui viennent les remplacer en Moravie septentrionale : c'est l'origine de la ""Valachie morave"" (et de l'actuelle République tchèque).


== Liste des rois de Grande-Moravie ==
820-846 : Mojmír Ier (prince)
846-870 : Rastislav (roi)
870-871 : Slavomír (roi)
871-894 : Svätopluk Ier (roi)
894-906 : Mojmír II (roi)


== Villes & lieux forts ==
La localisation de Moravia, la capitale (probable) de la Grande-Moravie reste inconnue.
En 843, 30 des 41 places fortes (civitates) de l'empire sont situées sur le territoire de la Slovaquie actuelle.
Les seuls lieux, faisant objet de mentions dans des textes, qui soient clairement identifiables aujourd'hui sont, outre Nitra, Devín (dans l´actuelle Bratislava) en 864, Uzhhorod (Ukraine) en 903, Bratislava en 907 et bourg de Staré Město/Welegrad (canton de Uherské Hradiště) au XIIe siècle.
Des restes de ces places fortes sont visibles aujourd´hui dans la vallée de la Morava à Mikulčice, Staré Město, Pohansko (Břeclav) et Modrá.


== Culture ==
La Grande-Moravie est surtout importante en ce qu'elle marque le début de l'écriture, donc de l'histoire, de la littérature et de la culture slaves. On notera, entre autres :
863 : première école slave (l'Académie grand-morave probablement à Devin)
828 : première église chez les Slaves (à Nitra)
premiers écrits slaves
première traduction en slavon de la Bible
premier code de lois slave
premier archevêché slave, etc.
La double croix byzantine apportée par Cyrille et Méthode est restée jusqu'à nos jours le symbole de la Slovaquie.

727,"Le monument Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption est un sanctuaire situé à Rogersville, au Nouveau-Brunswick (Canada).


== Histoire ==
Il est construit en 1912 par Marcel-François Richard pour abriter une statue de la Sainte Vierge qu'il avait reçue deux ans plus tôt lors du Congrès eucharistique de Montréal. Notre-Dame de l'Assomption est en effet la sainte patronne de l'Acadie. Le curé Richard est lui-même l'un des chefs de file de la renaissance acadienne et l'instigateur de plusieurs des symboles nationaux, dont celui de la sainte patronne. Par la construction du monument, le curé Richard souhaite donner un lieu de culte et de rassemblement aux Acadiens. L'endroit est toujours fréquenté de nos jours, notamment lors de la neuvaine de l'Assomption.
Le monument est perdu dans un incendie en 1969. Le monument actuel est construit en 1972, à l'instigation du père Alban Albert.
Le monument est reconnu comme lieu du patrimoine provincial le 6 novembre 1985.


== Description ==
Le monument comporte une chapelle, où reposent les ossements de Mgr Marcel-François Richard. Le terrain compte également une arche et des statues.

733,"L’église Saint-Jacques est l'église paroissiale du faubourg de l'Houmeau, à Angoulême, dans le département français de la Charente et le diocèse d’Angoulême.
Elle fait l’objet d’une inscription au titre des monuments historiques depuis 2001.


== Histoire ==
L'église est dédiée à Jacques le Majeur, un des 12 apôtres de Jésus, au nom duquel s'est effectuée la Reconquista en Espagne puis le pèlerinage à Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle.
Au Moyen Âge, principalement aux XIIe et XIIIe siècles, le faubourg de l'Houmeau à Angoulême était le point de passage d'une variante du chemin de Compostelle, qui arrivait de Montignac,.
L'église a été reconstruite en 1840 par l'architecte Paul Abadie père, à la place de l'ancienne église qui était dirigée vers l'est et menaçait ruine.
L'architecte reprend les plans de l'ancien bâtiment, en conservant la nef unique, la croix latine et l'abside semi-circulaire. L'architecture est marquée par des contreforts et des soubassements. La décoration intérieure était entièrement peinte, mais ces peintures ont disparu pendant les bombardements de 1944. La reconstruction, à nouveau d'une partie de l'église commencera en 1960, elle se terminera trois ans plus tard. En effet l'église a été endommagée par les bombardements des Alliés, en 1944. Aujourd'hui, l'édifice occupe la place centrale de la place.


== Architecture ==
L'architecture de l'édifice est de style néo-classique comme l'ensemble des édifices construit par Paul Abadie, qui impose le style néo-classique. Aussi, l'entrée de l'église soutenues par d'imposants piliers, fait référence aux anciens temples grecs.


== L'orgue ==

Construit en 1787 par l'organier Schwaerdt pour le couvent des bénédictines de Saint-Ausone à Angoulême, l'orgue est attribué, à la Révolution, à l'église Saint-Jacques où il fut installé en 1803. Restauré en 1847 par Leymarie & Trouillet, il est agrandi par Aristide Cavaillé-Coll en 1892. Heureusement épargné par les bombardements de 1944, il fut réinstallé au même endroit (dans la tribune), jusqu'à aujourd'hui, où nous pouvons encore l'admirer.

737,"Jean III d’Oświęcim (en polonais Jan III Oświęcimski), de la dynastie des Piasts, est né vers 1366 et est mort en 1405. Il est duc d’Oświęcim de 1375/6 à 1405.
Jean III est le seul fils du duc d’Oświęcim Jean II et d’Hedwige, la fille du duc de Brzeg Louis Ier.
Au début, Jean III entame une carrière religieuse comme son grand-père Jean Ier le Scolastique. En témoigne un document de 1379 dans lequel Jean III est appelé le Scolastique de Cracovie. C’est sans doute parce qu’il était destiné à rentrer dans les ordres que son père désigne en 1372 le duc de Cieszyn Przemyslaw Ier comme successeur. Pourtant, lorsque son père décède, Jean III lui succède. Aucun document historique ne nous est parvenu expliquant les raisons qui ont finalement amené Jean III sur le trône. Un document daté du 25 novembre 1377 et ratifié par le duc de Cieszyn confirme bien que Jean III est devenu duc d’Oświęcim.
Pendant les premières années de son règne, Jean III est épaulé par son cousin Przemyslaw Ier. En 1394, Jean III épouse Hedwige, la sœur du roi de Pologne Ladislas II Jagellon. Ce mariage améliorera les rapports entre la Pologne et le duc d’Opole Ladislas. En 1397, Jean III et d’autres ducs silésiens ainsi que l’évêque de Wrocław signent avec le roi de Pologne un accord de collaboration pour lutter contre les bandes de pillards. En 1399, Jean III essaie d’apaiser la colère de Ladislas II Jagellon contre l’évêque et duc d’Opole Jean Kropidło.
Sur le plan de la politique intérieure, Jean III favorise le développement des villes et de l’Église.
Jean III d’Oświęcim meurt en 1405. N’ayant pas d’héritier, son duché passe dans les mains des Piasts de Cieszyn. Jean III est inhumé dans le monastère des Dominicains d’Oświęcim.

739,"Phyllis Annetta Frelich (née le 29 février 1944 à Devils Lake dans le Dakota du Nord aux États-Unis et morte le 10 avril 2014 (à 70 ans) à Temple City en Californie) est une comédienne sourde américaine.
Elle a gagné le Tony Award de la meilleure actrice dans une pièce en 1980 pour son rôle dans Les Enfants du silence.


== Biographie ==
Phyllis Frelich naît à Devils Lake le 29 février 1944, de deux parents sourds. Son père, Phillip Frelich est d'abord fermier jusqu'aux treize ans de Phyllis où il devient typographe au journal local pour pouvoir mieux subvenir aux besoins de sa famille. Esther Frelich, sa mère, est couturière. Phyllis Frelich fait partie d'une fratrie de neuf enfants, sourds eux aussi, dont elle est l'aînée.
Elle entre à l'école pour les sourds du Dakota du Nord (en), sise à Devils Lake, puis continue ses études à l'université Gallaudet, un établissement qui accueille les sourds et malentendants, dont elle sort diplômée en bibliothéconomie en 1967.
Durant ses études à l'université, elle participe activement au théâtre, dans la troupe des « Eastmans », à tel point qu'à sa sortie du cursus scolaire, elle est invitée par David Hays à fonder avec lui la troupe du National Theater of the Deaf, ce qui marque un tournant dans son orientation de carrière et l'amène dès lors sur les planches et à l'écran.
Elle rencontre à ce théâtre Robert Steinberg, un metteur en scène du National Theater of the Deaf, avec qui elle se marie en 1968. Ils ont deux enfants, Reuben et Joshua, et un petit-fils.
Atteinte de paralysie supranucléaire progressive, une maladie rare et incurable qui la touche déjà dès 2011, elle décède le 10 avril 2014 chez elle, à Temple City.


== Carrière ==
Children of a Lesser God est la pièce qui a rendu Phyllis Frelich célèbre. Écrite en hommage à elle en 1979 par Mark Medoff, la pièce connait un grand succès, jusqu'à recevoir trois Tony Awards dont un pour Phyllis Frelich. Une critique très favorable du New York Times le 13 avril 1980 slaue l'originalité et la qualité de la pièce, vuee de son côté par la communauté sourde comme une percée significative parmi les entendants.
Outre cette récompense, Phyllis Frelich reçoit aussi en 1981 le Roosevelt Rough Rider Award, une récompense de l'état du Dakota du Nord. Elle est élue en 1991 à la Screen Actors Guild pour faire partie du jury de 90 membres, devenant ainsi la première actrice sourde à accéder à un tel poste.

740,"L'oblast de Magadan (en russe : Магада́нская о́бласть, Magadanskaïa oblast) est un sujet fédéral de la Russie. Couvrant une superficie de 462 464 km2, l'oblast est la 11e plus vaste subdivision de Russie. Sa capitale administrative est la ville de Magadan.


== Histoire ==
L'oblast de Magadan a été institué le 3 décembre 1953 dans ce qu'on appelait alors populairement la Kolyma. Les ressources considérables du sous-sol en matières premières, notamment la richesse des filons d'or et d'argent, les veines d'étain, et les dépôts de tungstène, poussèrent les autorités soviétiques sous Staline à charger l'organisation Dalstroï à développer le creusement des mines et l'aménagement des réseaux de transport en exploitant la main d’œuvre des goulags.
Puis à la mort de Staline, la dissolution de Dalstroï poussa l'administration régionale à reprendre ces responsabilités. La première tâche fut de remplacer le travail forcé par des emplois salariés, la main d’œuvre étant attirée par les perspectives d'expansion économique rapide de la région, en particulier les mines d'or.
Les peuplades indigènes de la région : les Evenes, les Koryaks, les Ioupiks, les Tchouktches, les Orotches, les Tchouvanes et les Itelmènes, qui vivaient traditionnellement de pêche en Mer d'Okhotsk, ou de l'élevage du renne dans la vallée de la Kolyma, subirent les méfaits de l’industrialisation ; en contrepartie, ils bénéficiaient de l'aide sociale des institutions jusqu'à leur dissolution en 1987 dans le cadre de la Perestroïka : c'est ainsi qu'aujourd'hui ces minorités sont durement touchées par le chômage.
Le district autonome de Tchoukotka était autrefois subordonné administrativement à l’Oblast de Magadan, mais il a proclamé son autonomie en 1991.


== Géographie physique ==

Le nord de l’Oblast de Magadan est une région montagneuse hostile à l'homme, couverte tantôt par la toundra, tantôt par la taïga. La moitié méridionale est en partie boisée, avec des forêts de bouleau, de saule, le sorbier des oiseleurs, le mélèze et l’aulne.
Les espèces animales de cette région sud sont principalement le mouflon des neiges, le renne, l’orignal et l’ours brun. On trouve aussi plusieurs varietés d'oiseaux, essentiellement des palmipèdes et des oiseaux de mer. La Mer d'Okhotsk est très poissonneuse, notamment en colin, en hareng, en morue, en flet et saumon, ainsi qu'en crabes et fruits de mer.


== Économie ==
L’économie est tournée vers l'exploitation des mines de métaux non-ferreux, avec pour unique centre industriel la ville de Magadan. L'exploitation agricole n'a pas dépassé le stade des cultures vivrières. Au mois d'avril 2014, le gouvernement russe a voté la prorogation pour l'Oblast du statut de Zone Économique Particulière jusqu'au 31 décembre 2025.
L’oblast de Magadan est considéré comme l'une des plus riches régions au monde en matière de ressources minérales. Le principal minerai est l'or, bien que les filons d'argent et les gisements d'étain soient eux-mêmes très importants. On compte plus de 2000 placers aurifères dans la région, dont 100 filons d'or et 48 d'argent. Récemment, les autorités se sont intéressées à l'exploitation des veines de houille. À moyen terme, les perspectives d'extraction de pétrole et de gaz naturel devraient se concrétiser également.
La pêche est la seule industrie alimentaire de la région, et représente le deuxième bassin d'emploi après les mines. Les 600 000 km2 de la Mer d'Okhotsk baignant l’oblast de Magadan forment l'un des océans les plus poissonneux au monde. L’oblast de Magadan possède plus de 15 900 km de côtes et 29 016 km de rivières navigables ou flottables. Les chalutiers des compagnies de pêche locales sont principalement actifs dans la zone économique Russe, la Mer d'Okhotsk, la Mer de Bering, et en partie en mer du Japon. L'essentiel des prises est réalisé dans les eaux côtières. L'industrie halieutique se concentre à Magadan, Ola, iamsk et Evensk. Le poissons les plus vendus sont le colin, le hareng, la morue et le navaga (apparenté à la morue), le flet et différentes variétés de saumon ; mais on pêche également des crabes, des calmars, des crevettes et des bulots.
Compte tenu de son climat rigoureux, l’agriculture de la Région de Magadan est rudimentaire, de sorte que 50 % des produits d'alimentation doivent être importés. Le complexe agroalimentaire regroupe quelques industries et des coopératives agricoles : la Sté Gormolzavod, une distillerie, une usine de pâtes, une usine de saucisses, la ferme volaillère Douktcha, et le sovkhose Khasynski.. Les spécialités du pays sont l’élevage du renne et des animaux à fourrure, la chasse traditionnelle, la pêche et le piégeage animal.
Malgré la richesse de son sous-sol, l'économie de la région est plutôt en déclin ces dernières années. Le climat rigoureux, l'insuffisance des infrastructures en sont en partie la cause, mais c'est surtout la délicate transition entre l'ère soviétique et le libre-échangisme qui ont entraîné la faillite des compagnies locales, et incité les habitants à émigrer en masse. Lors d'une visite officielle à Magadan au mois de novembre 2005, le Président Vladimir Poutine a approuvé la prorogation des avantages fiscaux aux employeurs de la région afin de relancer l'extraction de minerai d'or.
Si le taux de chômage officiel dans la Région de Magadan est d'environ 12 %, il est bien supérieur dans les zones à forte densité d'indigènes (16–18 %). Le véritable taux de chômage doit être plus élevé encore (sans doute 20 %), car il est impossible de recenser les idividus résidant loin des villages ; l'élevage du renne a été abandonné en plusieurs endroits, les quotas de pêche sont presque impossibles à calculer, et la part de l'emploi indigène dans les usines et les mines est indéterminée.

741,"La 16e élection du gouverneur de la préfecture d'Aichi (第16回愛知県知事選挙, Dai-jūroku-kai Aichi-ken Chiji senkyo) est une élection japonaise locale qui s'est tenue le 4 février 2007. Elle a vu la réélection pour un troisième mandat de Masaaki Kanda.


== Contexte national et préfectoral ==
Ce scrutin est le second vote local d'une année 2007 chargée sur le plan électoral au Japon, avec les élections locales unifiées des 8 (élections simultanées de 13 gouverneurs sur 47, dont surtout celui de Tōkyō, et des maires de 4 des 17 villes désignées par ordonnance gouvernementale) et 22 avril 2007 (élections de 262 maires et de 779 conseils municipaux) puis le renouvellement de la moitié de la Chambre des conseillers, la chambre haute de la Diète du Japon, du 29 juillet 2007. Il s'agit de la première élection d'un gouverneur d'Aichi à être réellement politisée, même si, comme le veut une habitude des scrutins locaux japonais, encore une fois les candidats se présentent tous comme indépendants. En effet, le gouverneur sortant Masaaki Kanda avait été élu en 1999 puis réélu en 2003 avec l'investiture des principales forces politiques nationales, qu'elles soient membres de la majorité menée par le Parti libéral-démocrate (PLD, centre droit) ou de l'opposition non-communiste dominée par le Parti démocrate du Japon (PDJ, centre voire centre gauche). Il avait d'ailleurs à chaque fois largement gagné, avec 61,2 % des suffrages la première fois puis 70,52 % la deuxième. Ce n'est plus le cas en 2007.
Masaaki Kanda, candidat à sa réélection, est investi par les partis de la majorité gouvernementale de centre droit : le PLD et son allié le Nouveau Kōmeitō (centre d'influence bouddhiste). Il a face à lui principalement Yoshihiro Ishida, jusque là maire d'Inuyama, candidat soutenu par les trois principaux mouvements de l'opposition non-communiste : le PDJ, le Parti social-démocrate (PSD, centre gauche) et le Nouveau parti du peuple (NPP, centre droit). Le troisième et dernier participant, Seiroku Abe, un ancien dirigeant syndical local, est quant-lui avancé par le Parti communiste japonais (PCJ). Le scrutin est ainsi largement présenté par les médias comme un test pour les acteurs de la scène politique nationale.
Or, la préfecture d'Aichi, avec son imposante agglomération de Nagoya (la troisième du pays) et ses zones industrielles, est connue pour être un foyer important de l'électorat de centre gauche. Ainsi, les élections législatives du 11 septembre 2005, pourtant marquée par une sévère défaite du PDJ et à une large victoire du PLD, a tout de même permis à 6 circonscriptions sur 15 d'être gagnée par un candidat démocrate (elles étaient 10 après les précédentes législatives de 2003). De plus, la majorité et le gouvernement du Premier ministre Shinzō Abe, successeur depuis le 26 septembre 2007 du populaire Jun'ichirō Koizumi, connaît plusieurs difficultés depuis la fin de l'année 2006. Plusieurs de ses membres ont notamment alors été touchés par des scandales de financement politique. Tout d'abord, le ministre de la Réforme réglementaire Gen’ichirō Sata doit annoncer sa démission du Cabinet le 27 décembre 2006 après avoir reconnu l'existence de « comptes inappropriés » rendus par son équipe de financement. Ensuite, les médias rapportent durant le mois de janvier que cinq ministres (ceux de l'Éducation, de la Culture, des Sports, des Sciences et de la Technologie Bunmei Ibuki, de l'Agriculture, des Forêts et de la Pêche Toshikatsu Matsuoka, des Finances Kōji Omi, des Affaires intérieures et des Communications Yoshihide Suga et de la Réforme réglementaire Yoshimi Watanabe) et deux officiels du PLD (le président du Conseil de la Recherche politique Shōichi Nakagawa et celui du Conseil exécutif Yūya Niwa) aurait déclaré 689 millions de yens au titre des « locations de bureaux » sur cinq ans jusqu'en 2005, alors même que leurs organisations de gestion de leurs fonds politiques siégeaient toutes dans des bureaux mis à la disposition gratuitement par la Diète aux parlementaires. Plusieurs déclarations controversées de personnalités du gouvernement bouleversent également l'opinion. C'est surtout le cas, une semaine avant le scrutin, du ministre de la Santé, du Travail et des Affaires sociales Hakuo Yanagisawa qui s'est attiré les attaques de l'opposition (le PDJ, par la voix de son ancien président Naoto Kan, annonce boycotter les discussions à la Chambre des conseillers sur le vote important d'un budget supplémentaire tant que Yanagisawa n'aurait pas démissionné) et la colère d'associations féministes pour avoir parlé des femmes comme de « machines à porter des enfants ». La popularité de Shinzō Abe et de son Cabinet en pâtit, puisque leur taux de soutien, selon des sondages réalisés pour la NHK, tombe pour la première sous celui des mécontents courant janvier.
Mais le choix du gouverneur est également lié à d'autres enjeux, que ce soit la personnalité ou la notoriété des candidats et des questions de politique locale. Masaaki Kanda garde ainsi une certaine popularité pour sa politique, lancée dès le début de son premier mandat, de transparence des informations transmises à la population par les services de la préfecture et tout particulièrement par la police régionale, afin d'éviter d'éventuels scandales. Il a ainsi fait remonter en un an sa collectivité de la dernière à la cinquième place du classement de la transparence des 47 préfectures japonaises établi annuellement par un groupe d'ombudsmen, ou défenseurs des droits des citoyens. Il a acquis aussi une certaine notoriété tant localement, nationalement et internationalement pour une politique de prestige et de grands travaux symbolisée par l'organisation par Aichi de l'exposition internationale spécialisée du 25 mars au 25 septembre 2005. Cette manifestation est alors l'occasion d'inaugurer l'Aéroport international du Chūbu, qui devient la principale plateforme aérienne du centre du Japon, ou encore de la ligne de train à sustentation magnétique, ou Maglev, du Linimo qui dessert la banlieue de Nagoya. Le 22 septembre 2005, Masaaki Kanda a succédé également au maire de Hanovre Herbert Schmalstieg comme président de l'Association des villes et régions hôtes d’expositions internationales (AVE), en place jusqu'à l'Expo 2010 de Shanghai. Il reste, malgré le contexte national difficile pour son camp, le favori tout au long de la campagne.
Néanmoins, son rival Yoshihiro Ishida est lui aussi devenu plutôt populaire localement pour sa politique à Inuyama, s'appuyant sur la mise en place d'un « projet local » et la défense de l'autonomie des municipalités. Surnommé durant son mandat le « maire réformiste » (改革派市長, Kaikaku-ha shichō), il s'est notamment appuyé sur la promotion culturelle (avec la réhabilitation de la vieille-ville et du château, le plus ancien du Japon à être encore debout) et éducative (par la création, par exemple, de 30 classes supplémentaires dans les écoles élémentaires de la ville).


== Liste des candidats ==
Seiroku Abe, 67 ans, directeur du centre du dialogue social de la Fédération syndicale ouvrière d'Aichi. Indépendant soutenu par le PCJ.
Yoshihiro Ishida, 61 ans, ancien détaillant, ancien maire d'Inuyama de 1995 à 2006, ancien élu à l'Assemblée préfectorale d'Aichi (membre alors du groupe PLD) de 1983 à 1995. Indépendant soutenu par le PDJ, le PSD et le NPP.
Masaaki Kanda, 55 ans, avocat de formation, gouverneur depuis 1999, ancien maire d'Ichinomiya de 1989 à 1998. Indépendant soutenu par le PLD et le Nouveau Kōmeitō.


== Résultats ==
Sans véritable surprise, Masaaki Kanda est réélu pour un troisième mandat. Cependant, il l'emporte avec une très faible avance sur Yoshihiro Ishida : seulement 69 048 voix et 2,35 points d'écart. Les commentateurs lient ce scrutin serré aux scandales et dérapages qui ont touché juste avant le vote la majorité, tout particulièrement les propos du ministre Hakuo Yanagisawa qui semble avoir détourné une bonne partie de l'électorat féminin de Kanda. Ce dernier paraît également avoir souffert d'un certain désaveu de la part des électeurs indépendants, qui avaient fait en partie son succès lors des précédentes élections. En effet, Yoshihiro Ishida a réuni derrière son nom 55 % des votants non partisans. Le dernier enseignement de ce scrutin est une participation, bien que toujours assez faible avec seulement 52,11 % des inscrits à s'être déplacés aux urnes, nettement plus forte qu'habituellement (elle n'était que de 41,92 % en 1999 et de 38,91 % en 2003).

742,"Ansbert (629-694) est un saint chrétien troisième abbé de l’abbaye de Saint-Wandrille, évêque de Rouen. Il est fêté le 9 février.


== Sa vie ==
Enfance
Saint Ansbert est né en 629 à Chaussy-en-Vexin dans une famille noble. Très vite, il est repéré pour ses capacités intellectuelles. Son père Silvinus décide donc de le marier à la cousine de saint Lambert, dont le père Hrotbertus possédait une charge de référendaire à la chancellerie de Clovis II, afin de faire d’Ansbert un fonctionnaire du Palais. Saint Ansbert est donc fiancé à Angadresme qui ne voulait pas se marier mais vivre en religieuse, les récits les plus anciens affirment qu’elle eut une maladie de peau et réussit à annuler ses fiançailles, puis elle entra dans un monastère. Ansbert partit donc à la cour sans se marier, et il devint référendaire (préparation des diplômes pour signature royale…). Il reste la trace d’un référendaire de cette époque : jugement de Clotaire III, entre l’abbaye de Saint-Denis et l’évêque du Mans Baracharius prononcé en novembre 659/660. Plus tard, il devient chancelier (chargé de garder l’anneau royal avec lequel on authentifiait les actes). Priant souvent, il fit une fugue afin de rejoindre saint Wandrille dans l’abbaye de Fontenelle. Il repartit à la suite d'une discussion avec saint Wandrille, et obtint du roi Clotaire III la liberté de ses charges, puis il devint moine dans l’abbaye de Fontenelle. Là, saint Ansbert commença à étudier les livres de l’abbaye en construction (dont les écrits de Grégoire le Grand, et de saint Colomban) et devint un moine « modèle ».
Abbé de l’abbaye de Saint-Wandrille de Fontenelle
En 668, saint Wandrille meurt et saint Lantbert devient abbé de Fontenelle. Quand il est appelé à Lyon, saint Ansbert devient vers 677/679 l’abbé de Fontenelle, après avoir résilié sa charge de chancelier. Durant ces dix années d’abbatiat, la renommée de l’abbaye grandit et de nombreux dons sont faits d’après son biographe à l’abbaye. À la mort de saint Ouen (évêque de Rouen), en 684, le roi convoque Ansbert et l’oblige à devenir évêque de Rouen, après la sollicitation du peuple. Il est sacré par saint Lantbert.
Évêque de Rouen

On raconte qu’il a donné beaucoup d’argent aux pauvres, notamment en distribuant lors des disettes l’argent économisé. Il écrit un livre Quaestiones . Le 7 mai 688, il déplace les restes de saint Ouen dans la basilique Saint-Pierre de Rouen sur un degré derrière le maître-autel, équivalent d'une canonisation. Il fait construire un baldaquin décoré de métaux et pierres précieuses. Mais les changements politiques conduisent à ce que Pépin de Herstal l'envoie en exil en 689/690 à l'abbaye d'Hautmont, pour être remplacé par Grifo, un de ses partisans. L'élévation du corps de Ouen, un an après la victoire à Tertry des Austrasiens sur les Neustriens, pourrait être une des causes de son arrestation par les Austrasiens et de sa déportation. Le 9 février 694, il meurt et est enterré à l’abbaye Saint-Wandrille, alors que de nombreux miracles se sont produits sur le chemin. D'autre sources précise sa mort en 695 à l'abbaye d'Hautmont . Il est plus important à cette époque d'être abbé de Fontennelle qu'évêque de Rouen.

743,"Nathaniel Prentice Banks ou Nathaniel Prentiss Banks, né le 30 janvier 1816 à Waltham (Massachusetts) et mort le 1er septembre 1894 au même endroit, est un homme politique et militaire américain. Il fut notamment gouverneur du Massachusetts, président de la Chambre fédérale des représentants, et général de l'Union durant la Guerre de Sécession.


== Jeunesse ==
Nathaniel P. Banks est né le 30 janvier 1816 à Waltham dans le Massachusetts. Très tôt, il dut travailler dans l'industrie textile. Il exerça ensuite plusieurs métiers tels que mécanicien, éditeur d'hebdomadaires et employé.
Il étudia ensuite le droit et fut admis au barreau du comté de Suffolk en 1839. Il s'établit à Boston et pratiqua le droit dans cette ville où il se fit vite connaître grâce à ses talents d'orateur.
En 1847, il épousa Mary Theodosia Palmer.


== Carrière politique (1849-1860) ==
Nathaniel Banks commença sa carrière politique dans les rangs du parti démocrate comme élu à la chambre des représentants du Massachusetts. Il en fut le président en 1851 et 1852. En 1853, il fut élu à la chambre des représentants du congrès des États-Unis. Il s'était déjà démarqué quelque peu du parti démocrate en rejoignant les rangs des free-soilers, une dissidence du parti démocrate opposée à l'expansion de l'esclavage dans les Territoires.
En 1854, il se rapproche de l'american party (know nothing), un parti nationaliste anti-papiste. Il est élu président de la chambre des représentants du congrès des États-Unis au 133e tour de scrutin soutenu en cela par son parti et par le parti républicain. Son élection est considérée comme la première grande victoire du parti républicain.
Il rejoint d'ailleurs très vite les rangs du parti républicain nouvellement créé en 1854, trouvant en ce parti le seul défendant la cause de l'antiesclavagisme. Il est réélu en 1856 sur les listes de ce parti mais démissionne en 1857 à la suite de son élection au poste de gouverneur du Massachusetts.
Il essaie de se présenter à l'investiture républicaine pour la présidentielle de 1860 mais les conflits au sein du parti républicain de son État et son passé de know-nothing antiesclavagiste (néfaste pour les États du haut-sud que sont le Maryland, la Viriginie, le Kentucky et le Missouri) le font vite retirer de la course.


== Guerre de Sécession (1861-1865) ==
À l'entame de la guerre de Sécession, et du mandat de Lincoln, ce dernier pensa faire entrer Banks dans son cabinet mais il le nomma plutôt major général (de la milice du Massachusetts) car la milice de son État était l'une des mieux organisées au début de la guerre.
Bien que Banks portât l'étiquette de « général politique », il fut petit à petit considéré par les généraux sortant de West Point car ils comprirent vite que Banks, par ses contacts politiques, pouvait leur apporter beaucoup.
Banks reçoit comme premier commandement la mission d'assurer le maintien de l'état esclavagiste du Maryland dans l'Union. Il remplace ensuite le général Patterson et prend le commandement de l'ex-armée de la Shenandoah (Union) (devenue un corps de l'armée du Potomac) après la défaite à la première bataille de Bull Run. Il passe une bonne partie de l'année 1862 à poursuivre le général confédéré Thomas Jonathan Jackson (Stonewall Jackson) sans jamais pouvoir se mesurer à lui. De plus ces échecs, qui sont pour les confédérés l'occasion de se fournir abondamment en vivres, armes, munitions et médicaments, le font baptiser ""the quarter-master"" (""l'officier d'intendance"") par les hommes de Jackson.
Il rencontre Jackson et l'attaque le 9 août 1862 lors de la bataille de Cedar Mountain (son corps d'armée est désormais incorporé dans l'armée de Virginie commandée par le Maj. Gen. Pope) . Il semble l'emporter lorsqu'une contre-attaque confédérée menée par A.P. Hill l'arrête.
En novembre 1862, après la défaite de la seconde bataille de Bull Run et la retraite de l'armée du Potomac (unioniste) dans les murs de Washington D.C. , Banks est chargé de créer une armée de 30 000 volontaires recrutés dans les États de New-York et de Nouvelle-Angleterre. Son statut d'ex-gouverneur du Massachusetts et ses contacts politiques font que cette mission est une réussite.
En décembre 1862, il reçoit le commandement du département du golfe et embarque avec une bonne partie de ses recrues pour La Nouvelle-Orléans. Il a entre autres pour mission de remplacer le gouverneur militaire de New Orleans  : Benjamin Butler, que ses abus et malversations ont rendu très impopulaire. Banks sera moins dur que Butler envers la population qu'il administre, mais n'échappera pas aux accusations de corruption.
Sur le plan militaire, il va essayer de remonter le Mississippi et de faire sa jonction avec les forces du Maj. Gen. Grant qui assiègent Vicksburg. L'armée confédérée, retranchée à Port Hudson, lui barre la route durant quarante-huit jours, ne se rendant le 9 juillet 1863 qu'après avoir reçu la nouvelle de la chute de Vicksburg. Le siège de Port Hudson est la première grande bataille où des troupes afro-américaines furent employées durant la Guerre de Sécession.
À l'automne de 1863, Banks envoie des troupes au Texas pour dissuader les Français d'aider les confédérés.
En mars 1864, à contre-cœur et contre l'avis du général Grant, mais poussé par le général en chef de l'Union Henry Halleck, il commence la campagne de Red River. Cette campagne, dont Banks pensait tirer plus un profit financier (par la vente du coton) que militaire commence par une défaite (bataille de Mansfield, 8 avril 1864) et est un échec retentissant. Grant demande à Washington de rappeler Banks.
En tant que « Gouverneur militaire » de fait de la Louisiane, il s'est occupé de rétablir les institutions de l'Union dans cet état, il a favorisé l'élection d'un gouverneur modéré et il a influencé la Convention qui devait élaborer la nouvelle constitution de la Louisiane (notamment sur le vote des afro-américains).


== Carrière après-guerre ==
Il fut démobilisé en août 1865 mais fut accusé d'avoir fraudé dans l'octroi de permis de commerce aux planteurs de La Nouvelle-Orléans avant sa démobilisation en août 1865.
Il fut élu ensuite de 1865 à 1873 à la chambre des représentants du congrès et devint le président de la commission des Affaires Étrangères et participa à la commission d'enquête sur le scandale du Crédit Mobilier. Il joua un grand rôle dans l'acquisition de l'Alaska par les États-Unis, jouant de toute son influence pour que le Chambre des Représentants vote le budget pour le rachat et ratifie le traité.
Avocat de la destinée manifeste, il aurait voulu que son pays rachète aussi le Canada et les Îles Caraïbes pour diminuer l'influence européenne dans la région.
En 1872, son soutien à Horace Greeley, candidat libéral-démocrate (parti issu du parti républicain et hostile au président Grant) pour la présidentielle, lui coûte son siège de député. Il décida ensuite de travailler pour des compagnies ferroviaires, secteur en pleine expansion à l'époque, mais le mouvement de panique qui suit la faillite de la banque Jay Cooke & Company en 1873 ruine tous ses espoirs dans ce secteur.
Après un passage au sénat du Massachusetts en 1874, il est de nouveau élu au congrès cette année-là (sous l'étiquette d'indépendant) et est réélu en 1876 (en tant que Républicain). Il fut membre de la commissions d'enquête sur les élections frauduleuses en 1876 en Caroline du Nord.
Défait de nouveau en 1877, il est nommé par le président US Marshal pour le Massachusetts, poste qu'il exerça de 1879 à 1888.
Il est réélu pour la dixième fois au Congrès en 1888. Son état mental se détériorant, il ne reçoit pas l'investiture de son parti pour la législation suivante.
Il mourut le 1er septembre 1894 à Waltham et repose au Grove Hill Cemetery (Waltham).

Bien que le titre ne fasse pas directement partie du texte coranique, la tradition musulmane a donné comme nom à cette sourate La Vallée des pierres, nom d'une partie de l'Arabie du Nord.


== Période de proclamation ==
Selon la tradition musulmane, cette sourate a été proclamée pendant la période mecquoise, c'est-à-dire schématiquement durant la première partie de l'histoire de Mahomet avant de quitter La Mecque. Les savants musulmans s'accordent pour dire que cette sourate occupe la 54e place dans l'ordre chronologique.
D'après l'exégèse scientifique cependant cette distinction en deux ensembles de sourates est peu probante puisque qu'elle fait reposer l'organisation du Coran suivant un ordre chronologique de proclamation, hypothèse hautement spéculative car elle repose sur les « convictions que le Coran n’a qu’un seul auteur, qu’il n’a aucun rédacteur, et qu’il reflète l’expérience d’une communauté ayant existé autour de Muḥammad, à la Mecque et à Médine, entre 610 et 632 ».Le « relatif consensus des spécialistes » admettant une élaboration du Coran « jusqu'à plus d'un demi-siècle après la mort du Prophète » principalement sur la mise en forme du texte mais pouvant aussi concerner les contenus, de ce fait la datation du Coran n'est pas formellement admise comme remontant à la fin de vie de Mahomet.
Le Coran est constitué de 114 sourates de longueurs inégales, présentées dans un ordre de longueur assez sensiblement décroissant, et non dans l'ordre chronologique des révélations. Dans l'ordre traditionnel, An-Nisa est la 4e sourate. Les manuscrits anciens montrent des variations dans l'ordonnancement des sourates. Pour M.-A. Amir-Moezzi, « En sus de quelques variantes orthographiques et lexicographiques mineures, 22 % des 926 groupes de fragments étudiés présentent un ordre de succession de sourates complètement différent de l'ordre connu ». Certains versets supprimées dans la forme canonisée du Coran ont été rajoutés au corpus des hadiths.


== Résumé ==
Cette sourate relate les bienfait d'Allah sur l'humanité. Elle parle aussi d'Iblis (Satan) et du sursis qui lui est accordé avant sa défaite finale.

754,"Un train routier est un ensemble routier constitué, selon les pays et la réglementation, d'un véhicule tracteur routier tractant une ou plusieurs remorques se déplaçant sur le sol sans l'aide de rails. Dans le cas de deux véhicules remorqués il est parfois appelé train double.
Lors du développement du transport routier, il est apparu économiquement intéressant d'accroître la charge transportée par l'ajout de remorques de façon analogue à celle du chemin de fer.
En effet, la charge est limitée par la structure du véhicule et par la charge maximale par essieu autorisée par les réglementations, selon les pays concernés.


== Le problème des trajectoires ==
Au contraire d'un train ferroviaire dont tous les véhicules sont guidés par les rails, un ensemble de remorques routières ordinaires (à un ou plusieurs essieux, dont, parfois un ou plusieurs directeurs) ne restent pas dans les traces du véhicule tracteur, selon la courbe de la trajectoire. Plus la remorque est éloignée du tracteur, plus celle-ci se déplace sur une courbure inférieure à celle du tracteur : elle a tendance à avoir une courbe plus courte dans un virage, sauf si elle bénéficie d'un ou plusieurs essieux directeurs.
Dans la plupart des pays européens, les remorques multiples sont interdites à la circulation : sauf exemption en « convoi exceptionnel » ou selon la réglementation en vigueur, des exceptions peuvent être faites pour un tracteur à (semi-)remorque et remorque(s) supplémentaire(s), comme dans le cas fréquent des convois des professionnels forains ou du cirque.


== Le train Renard ==
Le colonel Charles Renard et son frère Paul étudient une solution pour les transports militaires, déposant un brevet, en 1903, d'un système assurant une trace unique pour tous les véhicules. De plus, un système d'arbre de transmission continu rend toutes les remorques motrices[réf. nécessaire].
Sous le nom de train Renard, ce système complexe est réalisé et utilisé aussi bien pour le transport de fret que de voyageurs ; mais même en plusieurs dizaines d'exemplaires, il reste à l'état de curiosité[réf. nécessaire].


== Aujourd'hui ==

Le train routier est autorisé sous certaines conditions et hors agglomération en Australie, dans l'ouest du Canada, au Québec, au Nouveau-Brunswick, en Nouvelle-Écosse et aux États-Unis[réf. nécessaire].
Il est très répandu sous le nom de road train sur les routes rectilignes de l'Australie, convoyant jusqu'à trois ou quatre remorques.
En France, l'appellation officielle d'un train routier est « un ensemble constitué d'un véhicule à moteur auquel est attelée une remorque ou une semi-remorque dont l'avant repose sur un avant-train ». Autrement dit, un camion remorque est un train routier au même titre qu'un train double ou un bi-train. La longueur maximale d'un train routier, en France, est limitée à 18,75 mètres.
En longueur, le record est détenu par un train routier à Toulouse de 373,95 m, pesant 120 tonnes (à vide)[réf. nécessaire].
En masse, le record est détenu par un train routier de 350 t, mesurant 358,6 mètres de long[réf. nécessaire].

756,"L'église Saint-Christophe est une église située en France sur la commune de Sauveterre-de-Rouergue, dans le département de l'Aveyron en région Midi-Pyrénées.
Cet édifice fait l'objet d'une inscription au titre des monuments historiques depuis le 3 février 1999.


== Localisation ==
L'église est située sur la commune de Sauveterre-de-Rouergue, dans le département français de l'Aveyron.


== Historique ==


=== L'église paroissiale ===

La bastide de Sauveterre-de-Rouergue a été fondée par Guillaume de Mâcon et de Vienne, sénéchal du roi Philippe le Hardi en Rouergue. La décision a été prise par le roi à la Pentecôte 1280 pour contrôler le Ségala. La bastide a été implantée entre Naucelle et La Salvetat sur la terre de Luzefre appartenant au seigneur de Villelongue, au sud de Sauveterre. En 1251, la famille qui tenait le château de Luzefre avait cédé sa part du château à l'abbaye de Bonnecombe. La famille de Saint-Privat est entrée en possession du château en 1259. Cette terre, comme celle de Villelongue appartenait au comte de Toulouse. En 1261, Bernard Brenguier de Malemort reconnaît tenir du comte son château et domaine de Villelongue, le village de Gramond et trois parts du château de Luzefre. En 1280 est signé le traité de paréage entre le roi et l'abbé de Bonnecombe sur la fondation de Sauveterre. Les seigneurs locaux doivent s'engager à aider la fondation de cette nouvelle bastide. Mais cette fondation va se heurter à l'opposition de Bégon de la Barrière, seigneur de Castelnau-Peyralès, qui se prétendait suzerain de Bernard Brenguier de Malemort. Mais le sénéchal de Rouergue Pierre Bouche (ou Bochi) passe outre à cette opposition en 1281 et entreprend les travaux de construction. La ville nouvelle reçoit sa charte de franchises et de libertés en 1284. La charte précise aussi les limites du terroir. En 1301 la ville est dotée d'un bailliage allant de l'Aveyron au Viaur.
Le clocher de l'église a dû être construit sur une tour du château de Luzefre. Il a fait partie du rempart de la ville quand l'enceinte de la ville est construite en 1319. Le château de Luzefre a ensuite disparu. de la tour du Roi,« tor del Rey », de Sauveterre. Le 29 juin 1369, les troupes anglaises sont battues à Compeyre par Jean d'Armagnac.
La première église est construite en 1313 hors de l'enceinte de la ville, sur l'« Oratoire », à l'est du clocher actuel. On peut voir l'ogive de la porte de l'ancienne église sur le mur oriental du clocher. Sauveterre devient le siège d'une paroisse vers 1330 sous le patronage de saint Vital.
Le 13 février 1362, Sauveterre passe sous la souveraineté du roi d'Angleterre, duc d'Aquitaine. Jean Chandos reçoit du maréchal Boucicaut les clefs de la tour du Roi,« tor del Rey », de Sauveterre. Le 29 juin 1369, les troupes anglaises sont battues à Compeyre par Jean d'Armagnac. La garnison anglaise quitte Sauveterre en 1369 qui a été rachetée. Les fortifications sont renforcées par les Anglais et se poursuivent après 1369. La tour du Roi est rasée pour ne pas servir d'appui aux Anglais ou aux grandes compagnies. La ville va connaître une période de paix, entre 1380 et 1415. Les consuls de Sauveterre participent aux États de Rouergue. Ces États se sont réunis à l'intérieur de l'enceinte de Sauveterre de 1375 à 1378 et en 1386.
Le 21 janvier 1384, « sage homme Guilhem Vernhas », marchand de Montpellier, donne le reliquaire de saint Christophe à l'église. Ce don va entraîner le changement de dédicace de l'église.
Elle est déplacée à son emplacement actuel, à l'intérieur des remparts de la ville, en 1388. Sa construction a été faite dans le style gothique méridional. Les trois niveaux du clocher ont servi de grenier communautaire.


=== Les confréries et la collégiale ===
À partir de 1330, des confréries charitables et des confréries de métier, des chapellenies et des fondations pieuses vont être créées. Une fraternité des prêtres existe à Sauveterre.


==== Fraternité des prêtres ====
La Fraternité ou Université des prêtres de la communauté compte 14 membres en 1450, tous natifs de la ville et non bénéficiers. La Fraternité est ouvert aux cadets des familles de la ville qui souhaitaient entrer dans la prêtrise. Elle leur permet d'exercer leur ministère en ayant gîte et revenus. La fonction des prêtres est d'assurer le service des fondations et des offices pour les vivants et les morts. Ce rôle est rappelé dans les status de 1700 : « assurer des messes successivement pour augmenter le culte de Dieu et contribuer à la piété des habitants ». Ils reçoivent les revenus des fondations pieuses, obits et chapellenies. Les rentes de la Fraternité se sont étendues dans un rayon de 15 km autour de Sauveterre. En 1620, les revenus pour chaque prêtre sont de 18 livres, 4 ou 5 quintaux de seigle, de l'avoine, 2 poules, un livre de cire, et 7 à 8 de pitance selon leur présence aux offices.
On note qu'à la fin du XVIe siècle il y a un prêtre organiste, Johan Esquieu. Il meurt en 1598. En 1605, les consuls et conseillers de la ville discutent de l'embauche d'un organiste présent dans la ville, Guillaume Valiech qui a fait « soner l'orgue de la présente ville, les jours de dimanche et festes solempnelles et autres jours que sera besoing ... » jusqu'à sa mort. Le conseil de la ville a accepté de porter ses gages annuels à 50 livres.
Les prêtres sont au nombre de 25 avant l'épidémie de peste de 1628 qui tue la moitié de la population de Sauveterre. Il n'y a plus que 9 prêtres en 1629. Ils sont 15 en 1715, encore 9 en 1789.
La vie commune reste en vigueur jusqu'à la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Les assemblées de partage se tiennent dans la sacristie.


==== Confréries charitables ====
Confrérie du Copus-Christi qui regroupe les prêtres filleuls de Sauveterre.
Confrérie Sainte-Eutrope est fondée en 1406. Elle est reconnue par l'évêque de Rodez qui accorde 40 jours d'indulgence aux fidèles qui l'intègrent, et 40 jours aux fidèles qui assistent à la messe de Saint-Eutrope.
Confrérie Saint-Christophe, existante avant 1416, et qui compte 402 confrères en 1421.
En janvier 1416 est entreprise la construction d'une maison de la Confrayrie, « affin de fere là ung disner solempnel aux confrayres de la confrayrie institué al honeur de dieu et de monsieur sanct Christophe ».
Au printemps 1416, Vincent Ferrier vient prêcher dans la ville à la demande des consuls.
En 1470, les confréries du Corpus-Christi, de la Vierge Marie et de Saint-Christophe sont regroupées sous la direction de la confrérie du Corpus-Christi. C'est la seule confrérie charitable qui a subsisté au XVIe siècle. Elle a 77 membres en 1551. Les temps forts de la confrérie sont les messes solennelles, les processions et le banquet annuel. Le banquet a disparu au XVIIe siècle.


==== Confréries de métier ====
La plus ancienne confrérie de métier est celle des forgerons-couteliers, fondée le 24 juillet 1456, à la veille de la Saint-Éloi, dans la forge de Géraud Ferrières. Cette confrérie Saint-Éloi comprend alors 20 membres, 19 couteliers et un fabricant de fourreaux.
La confrérie Saint-Jacques des chapeliers est fondée le 13 mai 1585. Elle comprend 22 membres.
La confrérie Saints-Crépin-et-Crépinien des cordonniers est créée le 25 octobre 1595 avec 12 membres.


==== Collégiale Saint-Christophe ====
L'importance des fondations pieuses dans l'église amène l'évêque François d'Estaing à faire de l'église une collégiale de 25 prêtres, en 1514. Antoine d'Estaing, évêque d'Angoulême, frère de François d'Estaing, a été prieur de Sauveterre, en 1514.
L'édifice est inscrit au titre des monuments historiques en 1999.


== Description ==

L'église est du type gothique méridional. Elle se compose d'une nef unique de 25 mètres de long, 10 m de large et 13 m de hauteur. Elle est voûtée en berceau ogival divisé sur la longueur en 6 parties de largeurs inégales par 4 arcs-doubleaux saillants reposant sur des colonnes engagées dans les murs. Les colonnes ne descendent pas jusqu'au sol, mais à 3 mètres du pavé, et sont terminées en cul-de-lampe.
Il y a six chapelles, trois de chaque côté, placées entre les contreforts, communiquant avec la nef. Une rosace est percée dans le mur ouest.
La première chapelle située côté de l'épître (côté droit en regardant l'autel), appelée la Sardonne, est dédiée à Notre-Dame-de-Pitié, aujourd'hui saint Joseph. Elle a été fondée par un riche marchand de Sauveterre, Guillaume Sardon, le 15 juillet 1455. La deuxième chapelle est dédiée à Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, la troisième à saint Roch.
Du côté de l'évangile (côté gauche en regardant l'autel), la première chapelle est appelée chapelle de fer, dédiée aujourd'hui à Notre-Dame de Lourdes, la deuxième est dédiée au Sacré-Cœur de Jésus, la troisième est dédiée à saint Jean-Baptiste.
La sacristie se trouve derrière le maître-autel.


== Décor ==
Plusieurs éléments du décor de l'église sont protégés au titre des Monuments historiques.


=== Retable du maître-autel ===
Le retable du chœur est appliqué contre le mur oriental. Au-dessus du tabernacle, il se compose de quatre colonnes cannelées supportant l'entablement, deux colonnes de chaque côté du tableau représentant le Calvaire De chaque côté, entre les colonnes, se trouve une statue. Côté de l'évangile (gauche), saint Christophe à l'Enfant Jésus assis sur ses épaules, côté de l'épître (côté droit), saint Loup évêque. Au-dessus de l'entablement a été placée dans une riche décoration une statue de la Vierge tenant l'Enfant sur son bras gauche et un sceptre de sa main droite. De part et d'autre se trouvent des statues, de sainte Catherine martyre, à droite, de sainte Reine, à gauche, portant chacune les instruments de leur martyre.
La hauteur de l'ensemble atteint les 10 mètres. Il date du XVIIe siècle. Il a été classé au titre d'objet en 1979.


=== Stalles ===
Il y a 26 stalles dans le chœur, rangées à droite et à gauche, sur deux lignes. Le rang supérieur comprend 7 stalles, le rang inférieur, 6. On peut y voir les armoiries de la famille d'Estaing. Plusieurs de ses membres ont été prieurs de la collégiale Saint-Christophe.
Elles datent du XVIe siècle et ont été classées au titre d'objet en 1979.
À l'origine, le chœur des prêtres fraternisants était séparé de la nef des fidèles par « un grand balustre de bois entouré de sièges à double rang », comme le note Bernardin de Corneillan lors de sa visite de 1635. En 1741, le secrétaire de l'évêque Jean d'Ise de Saléon indique qu'il y a un jubé à l'entrée du chœur. C'était du haut de cette chaire que le diacre disait les premiers mots de la prière latine, « Jube, Domine, benedicere » (« daigne, Seigneur, me bénir »).


=== Retable de la Vierge à l'Enfant ===
Retable richement décoré de colonnes torsadées à pampres encadrant une statue de la Vierge à l'Enfant, dans la chapelle Notre-Dame du Rosaire.
Il date du XVIIIe siècle et a été classé au titre d'objet en 1981.

758,"Le Wassmer WA-30 Bijave est un planeur biplace français, conçu et fabriqué par Wassmer Aviation à Issoire.


== Conception et développement ==
Le WA-30 Bijave est la version biplace du Wassmer WA-21 Javelot II. Le premier Bijave a volé le 17 décembre 1958 à partir de l'Aérodrome d'Issoire. Le Bijave est un monoplan cantilever à aile haute avec un fuselage en tube d'acier soudé entoilé avec quelques éléments en composite résine-fibre de verre. L'aile est fabriquée en bois, coffrée en bouleau à l'avant du longeron et entoilée à l'arrière, elle est équipé d'aérofreins rétractables en bois perforé. L'aile est constituée de trois éléments : un plan central sans dièdre et de corde constante et deux plans latéraux amovibles fixés avec un dièdre de 4.5° par 3 axes mis en place par un système de biellettes et de renvoi. Les jonctions plan central / plans latéraux sont recouvertes d'une bande métallique, Le pilote et le passager sont assis en tandem dans un cockpit fermé par deux verrières individuelles. Le train d'atterrissage fixe comporte une roue suspendue freinée hydrauliquement complétée par un patin en bois monté sur des amortisseurs en caoutchouc, et une béquille métallique sous la queue.


== Historique opérationnel ==
Retenu à la suite d'un concours comme planeur école standard des clubs français pour remplacer les Caudron C800 et Castel C25s il a eu une longue carrière hélas ternie par plusieurs accidents mortels dus à deux problèmes de conception. Le premier souci a concerné les verrous de fixations des bouts d'ailes qui pouvaient se déboîter à la suite d'une descente rapide avec usage continu des aérofreins. Une simple cale en bois fixée sur la bande métallique recouvrant la jonction entre plan central et bout d'aile a suffi à empêcher tous risque de déverrouillage intempestif. Le problème avait quand même fait deux morts.
A partir d’août 1968 une épidémie de casse de plans centraux de Bijave se produisit. Les premiers cas furent imputés à des séquelles d’atterrissages durs et donnèrent lieu à des modifications de longerons. Les ruptures continuant à se produire le Secrétariat Général de L'Aviation Civile interdisait de vol tous les Bijave le 21 août 1970. Après deux années de tests, d'essais de modifications, une solution fut adoptée. Tous les plans centraux furent envoyés à Bernay chez CAARP/AMC ou les semelles de longerons reçurent un renfort en fibre de verre unidirectionnelle imprégnée de résine époxy logé dans une rainure fraisée. Au printemps 1972 tous les Bijave avaient été modifiés et pouvaient revoler.

=== Hydrographie ===

La Veyle traverse le nord de Saint-Julien et forme une partie de la frontière nord avec Vonnas.
Le Bief Bourbon prend sa source dans la commune voisine de Sulignat avant de passer à l'ouest du bourg du village. Il forme une partie de la frontière avec Biziat, commune dans laquelle finit le cours du ruisseau dans la Petite Veyle.
Le Bief Berthelon prend sa source dans la même commune mais passe à l'est du bourg avant de se jeter dans le Bief Bourbon près de la frontière avec Biziat.


=== Climatologie ===
Le climat de Saint-Julien-sur-Veyle est un climat tempéré à légère tendance continentale. La station la plus proche est celle de Mâcon qui lui confère donc les données climatiques de la ville-préfecture qui sont les suivantes pour la période entre 1981 et 2010.


=== Voies de communication et transports ===


==== Réseau routier ====
La route départementale D2 traverse le sud-ouest et passe par La Mitaine et dévie Le Logis, elle relie Pont-de-Veyle à Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne.
La route départementale D2e commence à La Mitaine et traverse le bourg du village puis Les Brosses et Potet avant de rejoindre la route D96 qui mène à Vonnas.
La route départementale D96 traverse le nord de la commune. Elle fait le lien entre Vonnas et Biziat.


==== Voies ferroviaires ====
Aucune voie ne traverse la commune mais la ligne de Mâcon à Ambérieu, desservie par les TER de la région Rhône-Alpes, passe à proximité. Les trains TER de la ligne s'arrêtent à la gare de Vonnas.


==== Transport aérien ====
La chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Saône-et-Loire gère un petit aéroport à Charnay, au sud-ouest de Mâcon.
Les habitants de la commune doivent se rendre à l'aéroport de Lyon-Saint-Exupéry distant de 69 kilomètres ou bien à l'aéroport de Genève distant de 144 kilomètres pour effectuer des vols vers l'international.


== Toponymie ==


=== Origine du nom ===

La commune doit pour partie son nom à Saint Julien, celui qui a donné son nom à l'église du village. Elle doit son nom aussi à la Veyle, rivière traversant le nord de Saint-Julien et qui est aussi utilisé pour le village de Saint-Jean-sur-Veyle.


=== Anciens noms ===
La première mention du village date de 1272 où le village porte le nom de Sanctus Julianus juxta Bisiacum, Bisiacum étant le nom de Biziat à cette époque. 1492 marque la première apparition de la rivière dans le nom de la commune, les archives de l'Ain mentionnant Sanctus Jullinus supra Velam.
Ensuite, le pouillé du diocèse de Lyon cite Sanctus Julianus supra Velam en 1587. On a toutefois la disparition de la Veyle avec Sainct Julin en 1617. Saint Jullien sur Veyle est cité en 1656, et en 1671, on trouve dans certaines sources le nom de Saint Julin sur Vele. La description de Bourgogne mentionne Saint Julien sur Veile en 1734, le nom actuel prend effet durant ce siècle.
Or, durant la Révolution française, dans le but d'effacer toute référence à la religion, on renomme le village Bourban ou Bourban-sur-Veyle jusqu'en 1801 où Saint-Julien-sur-Veyle redevient le nom de la commune.


== Histoire ==
En 1601, après la fin de la guerre franco-savoyarde qui se termine par le Traité de Lyon, Saint-Julien intègre la France avec l'acquisition de celle-ci de la Bresse, du Bugey, du Valromey et du pays de Gex. Elle est par la suite intégrée à la province bourguignonne.
Entre 1790 et 1795, elle devient un municipalité du canton de Châtillon-les-Dombes, et dépend du district de Châtillon-les-Dombes.

L'évolution du nombre d'habitants est connue à travers les recensements de la population effectués dans la commune depuis 1793. À partir de 2006, les populations légales des communes sont publiées annuellement par l'Insee. Le recensement repose désormais sur une collecte d'information annuelle, concernant successivement tous les territoires communaux au cours d'une période de cinq ans. Pour les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants, une enquête de recensement portant sur toute la population est réalisée tous les cinq ans, les populations légales des années intermédiaires étant quant à elles estimées par interpolation ou extrapolation. Pour la commune, le premier recensement exhaustif entrant dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif a été réalisé en 2007.
En 2014, la commune comptait 760 habitants, en augmentation de 7,95 % par rapport à 2009 (Ain : +6,33 %).

762,"L'orchestre national d'Iran (en persan: ارکستر ملی ایران) est un orchestre formé en 1998 par Farhad Fakhreddini qui s'est dissous en 2012. Il était surtout formé d'instruments à cordes et d'instruments à vent, dont un certain nombre d'instruments traditionnels persans. Pendant les quatorze années de son existence, il a interprété surtout des morceaux de compositeurs classiques iraniens.
Son concert d'inauguration qui s'est tenu à la salle Roudaki de Téhéran a donné des œuvres d'Ali Tadjvidi, de Farhad Fakhreddini et d'Hossein Alizadeh (le père d'André Hossein), chantées par Mohammad Reza Shadjarian.
L'orchestre national d'Iran a donné des concerts à l'étranger, notamment en Suisse et au Koweït. Il s'est dissout en octobre 2012, officiellement pour des raisons budgétaires.

763,"Frank’s Wild Years, sous-titré Un Operachi Romantico in Two Acts, est un album de Tom Waits sorti en 1987 sur le label Island Records.


== Historique ==
Les chansons de l'album ont été écrites par Waits et certains collaborateurs (principalement sa femme, Kathleen Brennan) pour une pièce portant le même nom. Le titre, à la fois de l'album et de la pièce dont il est issu, est inspiré d'une chanson de Tom Waits, Frank's Wild Years, sortie en 1983 sur l'album Swordfishtrombones, traitant d'un Frank Leroux, pseudonyme inspiré du prénom du père de Tom.
La pièce est une comédie musicale dont Tom Waits tient le rôle principal. Présentée en première par la Steppenwolf Theatre Company (en) au Briar St. Theatre de Chicago dans l'Illinois en 1985, elle n'eut pas de grand succès : Le New York Times lui reproche ses clichés, et Rolling Stones Magazine, sa longueur de trois heures. L'idée vint à Tom d'en faire un album.
Les morceaux furent retravaillés. Les chansons Temptation et Cold Cold Ground ont été utilisées dans le film Léolo de Jean-Claude Lauzon, sorti en 1992.
Les chansons Temptation et Straight to the Top (Vegas) ont été utilisées dans le film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, sorti en 2005.
Plusieurs versions de la chanson Way Down in the Hole ont été utilisées comme chanson thème de la série télévisée américaine The Wire, incluant une version par Waits lui-même lors de la seconde saison.

764,"La santé de l’économie wallonne dépend pour une large part de la capacité d’innover et de la recherche et développement des entreprises. La part des dépenses totales en R&D atteint environ 2 % du PIB wallon, mais l’objectif est de tendre vers les 3 % d’ici 2010. L’objectif n’est pas seulement budgétaire : il s’agit aussi de mieux articuler les différentes actions menées par les acteurs de la recherche, et surtout d’afficher sans tarder une volonté politique claire.


== 13 000 chercheurs en Wallonie ==
Selon les chiffres ministériels, les huit institutions universitaires wallonnes occupent plus de 7 000 chercheurs, sans compter ceux qui œuvrent dans les centres de recherche associés aux instituts supérieurs industriels. En outre, 1 000 scientifiques travaillent dans une trentaine de centres de compétence technologique implantés dans la région. Si l'on y ajoute plus de 4 000 scientifiques actifs dans les entreprises innovantes, l'effectif des sciences et des techniques en région wallonne approche les 13 000 chercheurs. La plupart de ces chercheurs disposent d'un statut médiocre et d'un avenir loin d'être assuré.
Ce potentiel devrait être renforcé, car la résolution européenne de Barcelone doit amener la Wallonie à augmenter d'ici 2010 ses moyens de recherche de 50 % dans le secteur public et de 40 % dans les entreprises, ce qui se traduira, à condition bien sûr que les promesses soient tenues, ce qui reste largement à voir, par le recrutement de plusieurs milliers de chercheurs supplémentaires. Pour la ministre, « seul un investissement massif dans la recherche et la valorisation de ses résultats permettra de créer les activités nécessaires à la satisfaction des besoins économiques et sociaux de la Wallonie (et) cette dynamique ne pourra être enclenchée et menée à bien que si elle emporte l'adhésion de tous.»


== Participation wallonne aux programmes de recherche européens ==
Principal instrument de financement de la recherche mis en œuvre par l'Union européenne, le programme-cadre de recherche européen (PCRD) s'adresse tant aux universités et centres de recherche qu'aux entreprises (petites, moyennes ou grandes). Le programme actuel (7e PCRD) se clôturera le 31 décembre 2013. Il est doté d'un budget global de 50 milliards d'euros et a pour principaux objectifs de renforcer la compétitivité de l'industrie européenne et de contribuer à construire l'Espace européen de la Recherche.
Le NCP-Wallonie informe sur les développements du 7e PCRD. Il conseille les acteurs wallons de la recherche et leur fournit une aide personnalisée pour leur projet de recherche européen.


== C.R.I.W. : Centre Relais Innovation de Wallonie ==
Le CRIW fait partie d'un réseau européen de 71 Centres Relais Innovation mis en place depuis 1995 par la Commission européenne. Ce réseau est intégré dans le programme spécifique ""Structurer l'espace Européen de la Recherche"" du 6e Programme-cadre. Le principal objectif du C.R.I.W. est de promouvoir auprès des entreprises, et particulièrement les PME, l'Innovation, l'exploitation des résultats de la recherche et, surtout, le transfert de technologie transnational. Le Centre Relais Innovation de Wallonie (C.R.I.W.) est un consortium formé par :
la Direction Générale des Technologies, de la Recherche et de l’Énergie (D.G.T.R.E.) du Ministère de la Région Wallonne. Elle assure la coordination et agit comme catalyseur des potentiels présents dans le consortium. Son rôle consiste notamment à définir les actions à mener en fonction des besoins et des intérêts exprimés par les entreprises et aussi, à définir les créneaux porteurs du tissu industriel wallon ;
le Groupement d’Intérêt Économique des Centres d’Entreprises et d’Innovation wallons (G.I.E.-C.E.I.). Spécialisé dans le montage et l’accompagnement de projets. Il prend en charge notamment les dossiers émergents recueillis à la suite des enquêtes chez les PME, des visites en entreprises et des contacts téléphoniques. Il les accompagne ensuite dans la démarche d’assistance à la préparation et à l’élaboration de projets d’innovation ou de transfert de technologie, à caractère transnational.
Le C.R.I.W. s'adresse aux entreprises wallonnes de manière générale mais, plus particulièrement, aux PME du tissu industriel wallon désireuses d'accéder à l'Innovation technologique (capacité de produire, d'assimiler et d'exploiter avec succès une nouveauté technologique) sur la scène européenne ou d'établir des transferts de technologie (cession de licence, intégration de nouvelles technologies, valorisation de résultats de recherche…) au niveau transnational. Sa stratégie se caractérise par une prise en compte systématique de la recherche d'opportunités technologiques transnationales (offres ou demandes), en relation avec la composition du tissu industriel et la situation économique wallonne.


== Compétences scientifiques et technologiques ==
Deux grandes catégories d'institutions participent, en Région wallonne, au développement des connaissances scientifiques et aux progrès technologiques nécessaires au développement économique et social régional.
Les universités et hautes écoles au sein desquelles la Wallonie dispose d'équipes de recherche internationalement reconnues.
Les centres collectifs de recherche qui réalisent des travaux de recherche de base et développent des activités de veille scientifique et technologique orientés vers les besoins d'un ensemble d'entreprises.
La Région wallonne confie également aux opérateurs de recherche la mission de promouvoir, diffuser, valoriser les nouvelles connaissances scientifiques et technologiques et de les rendre ainsi plus accessibles aux utilisateurs potentiels, principalement les entreprises. Tant dans les universités et hautes écoles que dans les centres collectifs de recherche agréés, des ""portes d'accès"" aux ressources scientifiques et technologiques disponibles ont été mises en place.
En ce qui concerne les universités et hautes écoles, la valorisation économique des résultats de la recherche est prise en charge par les cellules de valorisation et d'interface. Chaque université francophone dispose d'une telle structure tandis qu'une interface unique, l'ADISIF, assure la valorisation des compétences détenues par l'ensemble des Hautes écoles implantées en Wallonie.
Au sein des centres de recherche, la promotion des nouvelles technologies est assurée par des guideurs technologiques. Ingénieurs de haut niveau, ils ont notamment pour mission de sensibiliser les entreprises, et les PME en particulier, à l'intérêt que représentent les nouveaux développements technologiques dans leur domaine de compétences.

== Les clusters wallons ==
Le clustering est une forme innovante d'organisation entrepreneuriale basée sur le principe de la mise en réseau. Elle vise à permettre qu'un nombre significatif d'entreprises d'un secteur déterminé puisse répondre de manière adéquate, rapide et compétitive aux défis de leur environnement industriel. C'est-à-dire que le Cluster met à disposition des services et des compétences et qu'il favorise la rencontre de PME et les positionne par rapport à la concurrence ; c'est donc un état d'esprit pour développer les affaires.
Pour renforcer sa compétitivité dans des secteurs pour lesquels la Région wallonne dispose déjà d'un potentiel, le Gouvernement wallon a décidé, dans le cadre du Plan Marshall, de développer une politique de pôles de compétitivité. Cette politique vise à développer un secteur d'activité porteur pour la Région afin qu'il puisse atteindre un niveau d'excellence tel qu'il génère une dynamique de croissance nouvelle et permette de positionner la Wallonie sur le plan international.
Les pôles de compétitivité :
Le pôle Aéronautique et Spatial
Le pôle Agro-industrie
Le pôle Sciences du vivant
Le pôle Transport et logistique
Ensuite des clusters ont été définis :
Le cluster aéronautique
Cluster Auto-Mobilité
Cluster Céramique
Cluster Déchets Solides
Cluster éco-construction
Cluster espace
Cluster nutrition
Cluster recherche clinique
Cluster TIC (Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication)
Cluster Transport & Logistique


=== Quelques exemples de projets ===
Projet 3WSA du pôle Aéronautique et spatial visant le développement des applications au sol des informations spatiales (satellites de télédétection et satellites de géo positionnement (GALILEO)). Le pôle de compétitivité Aérospace, constitué par les clusters Espace et Aéronautique, veillera à structurer le positionnement de l'ensemble des acteurs wallons dans ce champ d'activités très porteur.
Projet Biowall du pôle agro-industrie : le but de ce projet de recherche est de développer des plastiques identiques ou aux propriétés identiques aux pétroplastiques mais à partir de matières premières renouvelables et aptes à se dégrader après utilisation.
Projet « Translogistic » du pôle transport-logistique : ce pôle, qui s'est résolument appuyé sur le cluster « transport et logistique Wallonie, a voulu centrer un de ses projets-phares sur la multimodalité dont chacun s'accorde à reconnaître l'importance pour la croissance économique. Leur projet porte sur le développement d'un système intégré pour la gestion temps réel du trafic fret multimodal (essentiellement à partir du transport ferroviaire via le développement des corridors de fret).
Projet « Keymarker » du pôle sciences du vivant. Centré sur les pathologies du cancer, des maladies inflammatoires et des maladies du cerveau, le but du projet KEYMARKER est d'identifier de nouveaux types de molécules (gènes ou protéines) dont la présence est étroitement liée à la maladie et à son évolution. La présence de ces biomarqueurs sera mise en évidence et suivie par les techniques les plus récentes d'imagerie médicale (PET scan par exemple).


== Les guideurs technologiques ==
La guidance technologique, nouvelle tarte à la crème du jargon techno-scientiste[non neutre], a pour objet la réalisation, pour des entreprises qui sollicitent l'expertise scientifique ou technique du centre de recherche, de prestations de service qui consistent en des audits technologiques de problèmes liés à des procédés ou produits, et en des conseils d'orientation vers des compétences technologiques. Elle vise donc la promotion de l'innovation technologique dans les entreprises.
La guidance est supportée par une activité de veille technologique consiste à permettre au centre de recherche de se tenir en permanence informé des progrès scientifiques et techniques survenus, en Belgique et à l'étranger, dans des domaines qui sont de sa compétences et qui présentent un haut potentiel d'innovation industrielle.
Actuellement, la Région wallonne subventionne environ quarante guideurs, chacun spécialisé dans une technologie pointue. Ces guideurs sont des ingénieurs seniors de haut niveau.
À l'heure actuelle, les services de guidance technologique soutenus par la Région portent sur les domaines suivants : la transformation du bois, la céramique et le verre, la technique des plasmas, les revêtements organiques, le recyclage des déchets industriels, l'utilisation et le développement des technologies de l'information et de la communication, l'e-business via l'utilisation de systèmes ouverts, l'application innovante de matériaux polymères, la mise au point de microdamiers d'ADN, l'identification et le traitement des polluants émis par les matériaux en milieux confinés, l'instrumentation optoélectronique, l'identification et la caractérisation de géosmines dans l'alimentation, la captation d'énergie solaire par les micro-algues, les textiles techniques et les paratextiles, la prévention et la maîtrise des risques liés aux contaminants chimiques, la qualité des produits textiles, l'extraction et la purification d'extraits naturels, l'emballage et le conditionnement, la conception et la réalisation d'outils et de matériel hydroélectroniques, l'interprétation physique des champs de contraintes rencontrés dans les processus industriels, l'assemblage d'éléments métalliques minces, la conception, réalisation et réparation d'assemblages soudés, la mise en œuvre des matériaux métalliques, monolithiques et composites, l'esthétique et l'économie des matériaux métalliques, la rénovation des bâtiments, les techniques de mise en œuvre en menuiserie, la mise en œuvre des bétons spéciaux, la climatisation et le confort intérieur de bâtiments, l'E-collaboration dans le processus de construction, la réparation du béton, l'acoustique dans le bâtiment, le verre dans le bâtiment, les travaux d'infrastructure (géotechnique, sols industriels), les technologies de traitement des matières solides primaires et secondaires, le prototypage rapide, la conception de produits et engineering des matériaux, l'injection de pièces techniques, Smart mechanics & processus, la productique intégrée, la traçabilité des produits, les traitements de surface, l'égouttage.


== Les aides ==
Les aides financières constituent un des principaux leviers mis en œuvre par la Région wallonne pour atteindre ses objectifs en matière de recherche, de développement et d'innovation technologique. Les dispositifs d'aide mis en place s'adressent à trois grandes catégories d'acteurs :
Pour les entreprises, il s'agit de les aider à innover sur le plan technologique en soutenant la mise au point de nouveaux produits, procédés et services, l'acquisition de nouvelles technologies et le renforcement de leur potentiel scientifique et technologique.
Pour les opérateurs de recherche — universités, hautes écoles, centres de recherche — il s'agit de permettre aux équipes de chercheurs de développer leurs compétences et leur expertise scientifiques et technologiques au service du tissu industriel wallon, de promouvoir les échanges entre monde scientifique et monde industriel et d'aider les acteurs wallons à s'insérer dans les réseaux européens et internationaux de recherche.
Pour les organisations de diffusion des sciences et des techniques, il s'agit les aider à mettre en œuvre des projets destinés à sensibiliser le grand public, et les jeunes en particulier, à l'évolution des sciences et des techniques et à valoriser les métiers qui y sont associés.


== Prométhée ==
Dans le cadre des fonds structurels européens 1995-1999, le programme Prométhée visait à définir les actions prioritaires et les réformes à mettre en œuvre pour stimuler la dynamique d'innovation en Wallonie et comportait trois chantiers dont les objectifs peuvent être définis comme suit :
Chantier 1 : mieux connaître le potentiel d'innovation de la Wallonie ;
Chantier 2 : favoriser les partenariats et les synergies par la mise en œuvre de grappes d'innovation ;
Chantier 3 : organiser un réseau d'offres de compétences adapté aux besoins des entreprises et un cadre porteur d'innovation. Il s'agissait dans ce cadre de mener une réflexion en profondeur sur trois thèmes :
L'organisation de la recherche et des structures d'appui qui ont pour mission de soutenir l'innovation dans la région (centres de recherche collectifs et assimilés, interfaces…) ;
La valorisation des résultats de la recherche universitaire
L'accès au financement public et privé pour les projets à risque.


== Prométhée II ==
Via le Fonds FEDER, la Commission européenne a décidé de cofinancer le Programme d'actions innovatrices de la Région wallonne intitulé Prométhée II, pendant une période minimale de deux ans couvrant les années 2004 et 2005. Le budget du programme, d'un montant de six millions d'euros, est financé pour moitié par la Région wallonne et pour moitié par l'Union européenne. Le cadre du programme Prométhée II est de permettre la réflexion sur la R&D (Recherche et Développement) en Wallonie.
Deux thèmes stratégiques ont été choisis pour leur importance particulière dans la politique de reconversion économique du Gouvernement wallon : « L'économie régionale fondée sur la connaissance et l'innovation technologique » et « eEuropeRegio, la société de l'information au service du développement régional ».
En effet, dans la « Déclaration de politique régionale 2004-2009 » (rien depuis ?), le Gouvernement wallon a rappelé sa volonté de soutenir une politique de recherche et d'innovation efficace et intégrée d'une part, tout en renforçant d'autre part, l'accessibilité de tous aux outils de la société de l'information.
L'objectif général du programme est de contribuer à l'intégration de la Région wallonne dans la société de l'information par la mise en œuvre de mesures innovantes visant à accroître la valorisation du potentiel scientifique et technologique wallon en faveur du développement économique de la Région et de permettre l'accès aux TIC à un plus grand nombre de TPE/PME, de demandeurs d'emplois, de travailleurs et de citoyens.
Prométhée II vise à mieux inscrire la Wallonie dans la société de l'information en promouvant l'utilisation des TIC par les citoyens et les entreprises. Il s'attache plus particulièrement aux objectifs suivants :
renforcer la compétitivité des entreprises en les incitant à davantage recourir aux TIC ;
réduire la fracture numérique tant sociale que territoriale par une action de proximité auprès des publics défavorisés et une action de coaching auprès des entreprises.


== Prix wallon de l'innovation technologique ==
Le prix wallon de l'innovation technologique est l'héritier du grand prix de l'innovation en Wallonie, initié dans les années 1980 et relancé au printemps 2005 à l'initiative du Conseil wallon de la politique scientifique (CPS), cette récompense entend souligner le dynamisme et la créativité d'entreprises innovantes. Il est soutenu par le ministre de la Recherche, des technologies nouvelles et des relations extérieures de la Région wallonne, et la Direction générale des Technologies, de la recherche et de l'énergie (DGTRE). Désormais bisannuel, le concours est doté d'un montant global de 7 500 euros. Les prix de l'innovation sont ouverts à toute entreprise ayant au moins un siège d'exploitation en Région wallonne.


=== Des leaders mondiaux ===
En remettant leur prix respectif aux entreprises lauréates à Namur le 10 octobre 2005, le ministre a souligné que celles-ci avaient quelques points communs entre elles et les autres entreprises nominées : d'être des leaders mondiaux dans leur branche, d'être financées par du capital à risque, de bénéficier des services de l'Agence wallonne à l'exportation (AWEX) et, pour la plupart, de participer au 6e programme-cadre européen de recherche-développement.


=== Trois lauréats en 2005 ===
La société KitoZyme gagne le prix dans la catégorie spin-off. Cette entreprise de Herstal, près de Liège, qui fêtera son cinquième anniversaire en décembre prochain, est née de l'Université de Liège et a maîtrisé un processus de production de biopolymères végétaux d'origine fongique, respectueux de l'environnement et utilisables dans plusieurs applications à haute valeur ajoutée, tels que les systèmes d'administration de médicaments, les produits cosmétiques, l'aide à la lutte contre l'obésité ou le cholestérol ou encore la clarification du vin.
Delta Services industriels (Dsi) emporte la palme de la jeune entreprise innovante. Située à Orcq, près de Tournai, et créée au printemps 2000, Dsi a mis au point des techniques de radiotraçages qui permettent d'optimaliser les moteurs à combustion interne, les lubrifiants et leurs additifs en analysant leur fonctionnement en temps réel. Cette mesure en continu permet aussi le suivi de la dégradation des systèmes de dépollution des gaz d'échappements. Les centres de recherches de grandes marques automobiles figurent parmi ses clients.
Free Field Technologies est couronnée comme entreprise chevronnée alors qu'elle n'est guère plus âgée que ses deux colauréates, puisqu'elle a été fondée en 1998 à Louvain-la-Neuve. Son produit phare est un logiciel de simulation acoustique qui permet de reproduire les mécanismes complexes de génération et de propagation du bruit et des vibrations. Ce logiciel, baptisé Actran, est utilisé notamment dans l'industrie automobile et aéronautique — c'est ainsi qu'il a servi à optimiser le comportement de l'Airbus A380.


=== Les autres projets nominés ===
La société Delphi Genetics (Charleroi) : produits innovants et des services originaux – gestion des brevets – dans le domaine des biotechnologies. Elle a développé une innovation unique au monde, Staby-Express, commercialisée sous formes d'une dizaine de kits de biologie moléculaire qui permettent notamment de produire par fermentation des protéines recombinantes d'une manière beaucoup plus efficace qu'avec les technologies existantes. L'ambition de la firme est de conquérir une place privilégiée sur le marché de production de protéines et d'ADN recombinant, en croissance soutenue.
La société Nanocyl (Sambreville) : nanotubes de carbone, un matériau du futur qui présente des propriétés extraordinaires. Ils sont utilisés dans une large gamme d'applications : écrans plats, protection anti-feu, blindages balistiques, etc. La société, qui est le plus grand producteur européen de nanotubes d'une pureté élevée avec une production quotidienne de quinze kilos, cherche de nouveaux débouchés dans l'industrie chimique, dans le secteur de l'aérospatiale, de l'automobile et de l'électronique, entre autres.
La société Belrobotics (Genval) : tondeuse Bigmow qui est à la fois autonome, silencieuse et non polluante et qui recharge ses batteries sans intervention humaine.
La société Intelligent Software Company (Arquennes) : système de planification avancée qui s'est concrétisé par le progiciel Li3 commercialisé depuis 2003 après avoir été testé dans une douzaine de sociétés de différents secteurs. Construite sur des concepts novateurs et des algorithmes originaux, la suite Li3 permet aux gestionnaires de planifier, de gérer et de contrôler les ressources et les activités de leur entreprise, avec une véritable aide à la prise de décision. Le progiciel a déjà séduit Janssen Pharmaceutica, le groupe 4 Falck et les Aéroports de Paris.
La société C.P. Bourg (Court-Saint-Étienne) : développement et fabrication de machines de finition pour l'imprimerie, particulièrement dans le secteur de l'automatisation du traitement du papier. Une de ses dernières innovations est une thermorelieuse de feuilles à dos carré qui permet la fabrication de livres de format et d'épaisseur variables à très haute cadence — plus de 500 exemplaires à l'heure — sans aucun réglage manuel préalable. Commercialisée depuis 2004, cette machine a déjà été vendue à 172 exemplaires dans le monde entier.
MACtac Europe (Soignies) : auto-adhésifs destinés à l'imprimerie, la décoration, le marquage, la photo, l'imagerie numérique et diverses autres industries, comme l'ameublement, l'électronique et l'automobile.

765,"La Triumph TR2 est une voiture de sport des années 1950 produite par la marque Triumph. Elle est équipée d'un moteur de tracteur Standard Vanguard à double carburateur de 1 991 cm3, qui développe 90 chevaux. Elle peut atteindre 172,7 km/h.


== Historique ==

Triumph lance le premier modèle de sa gamme TR, la Standard Vanguard 20TS (ancêtre de la TR2) au Salon automobile de Londres de 1952 en même temps que sa concurrente directe l’Austin-Healey 100 tout en étant beaucoup plus sobre et moins chère.
Après une période de mise au point placée sous l'autorité de Ken Richardson et visant à rigidifier le châssis du prototype, la TR2 (TR pour Triumph Roadster) est commercialisée en juillet 1953. Offrant le meilleur rapport prix/performances du moment, elle connaît un succès immédiat, notamment aux États-Unis qui vont absorber plus de 70 % de la production.
Construite par le groupe Standard Motor Co, la Triumph TR2 est née de la volonté de son propriétaire, sir John Black, qui avait assisté au succès de Jaguar et sa XK120, qui connaissait le succès aux USA.
Sir John Black proposa à la famille Morgan de racheter leur marque (auquel il livrait des moteurs pour les modèles Four-four (4/4) et Plus-Four) et, devant leur refus, décida de se lancer avec sa propre marque Triumph dans la fabrication d'un roadster pour viser la même cible de clientèle américaine (souvent des anciens « Boys » qui avaient passé quelque temps en Angleterre durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale).
L'objectif de Sir John Black était d'arriver à proposer un véhicule à un prix très compétitif tout en permettant à ses propriétaires de gagner des rallyes en fin de semaine. Cet objectif s'est traduit par deux contraintes : atteindre une vitesse minimale de 107,3 mph (plus de 172,7 km/h), avec un prix initial de 500 livres sterling maximum.


== Caractéristiques techniques ==
Dans le but de réduire les coûts, la ""Triumph Sports"" devra se contenter d'éléments mécaniques piochés dans la banque d'organes du groupe. Ainsi, le châssis sera celui de la berline Standard Nine d'avant-guerre, la mécanique sera celle de la berline Standard Vanguard (qui équipe aussi un tracteur Massey Ferguson), et le train avant et le pont arrière seront tirés de la Triumph Mayflower.
Le moteur sera toutefois muni de 2 carburateurs SU, d'un arbre à cames plus pointu, et sa diminution de l'alésage à 1991 cm² permettra à la voiture d'être éligible à la catégorie « moins de 2 litres » en compétition. Ce moteur plein d'allant mais affichant aussi une grande souplesse, économe à l'usage, robuste et facile à entretenir, procure au roadster des performances très honorables pour l'époque.

Ce quatre cylindres va se révéler l'atout majeur de la voiture.[réf. nécessaire]
Le dessin de la carrosserie est confié à Walter Belgrove qui doit composer avec des formes simples (pas de double courbure) afin de réduire les couts d'outillages. L'objectif est lui aussi de ressembler à la Jaguar XK120 avec ses phares globuleux à demi intégrés, des portières échancrées dépourvues de vitres, une jolie poupe effilée et une absence de calandre (les Anglais appelleront la calandre bomb hole (trou de bombe) par dérision).

766,"L'évangélisme en Suisse est un mouvement chrétien, issu de divers réveils spirituels, qui représente 250 000 personnes et plus de 1 500 communautés différentes.


== Évangéliques en Suisse ==
La désignation « évangélique » provient du grec evangelion, « bonne nouvelle ». L'évangélisme en général, mais singulièrement dans son développement helvétique, tire ses racines de la Réforme protestante avec une prédilection pour le refus du baptême des nouveau-nés, ainsi qu'un militantisme pour une séparation de l'Église et de l'État.
On parle de «chrétiens évangéliques» pour décrire les croyants au sein du christianisme caractérisés par les 4 éléments suivants :
La valeur essentielle de la Bible comme référence de la foi évangélique. Elle est considérée comme la norme autant sur le plan théologique que pratique.
Le rôle central de Jésus. Fils de Dieu, injustement condamné à mort sur la croix pour réconcilier le monde avec Dieu.
L'importance de la conversion personnelle. On ne naît pas chrétien, on le devient par choix personnel et engagement individuel. C'est ce qui explique l'importance accordée au baptême adulte.
L'universalité du message de l'évangile et l'importance, pour les chrétiens évangéliques, de le faire connaître autour d'eux, dans le respect de la liberté individuelle.
Fondée par les apôtres du Christ, il y a près de 2 000 ans, l'Église chrétienne s'est basée sur l'enseignement de Jésus formulé dans les évangiles. La prépondérance de la Parole de Dieu et la mise en pratique de l'évangile caractérisent l'Église du Ier siècle. C’est ce que désirent aussi vivre les Églises évangéliques d'aujourd'hui.
Les racines du courant évangélique en Suisse remontent au XVIe siècle. Les valeurs fondamentales des évangéliques viennent de réformateurs tels que Martin Luther ou Jean Calvin.


== Répartition des évangéliques en Suisse ==
En Suisse, on dénombre plus de 1 500 communautés évangéliques. 1 000 d'entre elles sont attachées à l'une des 40 fédérations ou associations d'Églises. En 2014, 250'000 évangéliques sont recensés, ce qui représente 3 % de la population. 42 000 d'entre eux sont en Suisse romande.
Le nombre d'évangéliques en Suisse n'a de cesse d'augmenter. Selon l'office fédéral de la statistique, le nombre d'évangéliques en Suisse était de 36 945 en 1970. En 2000, 150 000 évangéliques sont recensés en Suisse, dont 136 000 dans le cadre d'une fédération et 20 000 dans des communautés indépendantes et ethniques. Ce qui faisait 2,2 % de la population suisse rattachée à une Église évangélique, toutes dénominations confondues. Les Églises catholiques et réformées, elles, ont perdu de leur monopole.
La taille médiane des communautés évangéliques est de 80 participants réguliers. Un tiers des personnes qui se rendent à un office religieux en Suisse sont évangéliques, soit plus de 200 000 personnes par week-end.
En Suisse romande, plus de 300 communautés évangéliques sont présentes, pour une population de 2 millions d'habitants, soit environ une communauté pour 7 000 habitants. L'arrondissement du Jura bernois compte à lui seul près de 30 communautés, soit plus d'une communauté pour 2 000 habitants.
Dans le monde entier, sur 2,2 milliards de chrétiens, 600 millions sont évangéliques. En Europe, il y en a 18,4 millions.


== Principales dénominations évangéliques de Suisse ==
Parmi les principales Églises évangéliques de Suisse, nous retrouvons :
Églises Action Biblique Suisse : 14 communautés locales (11 en Suisse romande)
Églises du Plein évangile : 10 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande
Association vaudoise d'Églises évangéliques : 6 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande
Église libre de Genève : 6 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande
Association des Églises baptistes francophones : 6 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande
Mission pentecôtiste suisse (SPM) : 72 communautés locales (1 en Suisse romande)
Église pour Christ : 54 communautés locales (10 en Suisse romande)
Fédération romande d'Églises évangéliques (FREE) : 50 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande
Union des Associations missionnaires (UAM) : 46 communautés locales (7 en Suisse romande)
Union des Églises Chrischona : 95 communautés locales (8 en Suisse romande)
Union des Églises évangéliques libres (FEG): 90 communautés locales (aucune en Suisse romande)
Église évangélique méthodiste : 120 communautés locales (4 en Suisse romande)
Armée du salut : 74 communautés locales (17 en Suisse romande)
Églises adventistes de Suisse romande et Tessin : 20 communautés locales (18 en Suisse romande)
Union des Églises Évangéliques du Réveil de Suisse : 16 communautés locales (14 en Suisse romande)
Association évangélique (ex-darbystes) : 20 communautés locales (15 en Suisse romande)
Églises mennonites : 14 communautés locales (6 en Suisse romande)
Églises apostoliques romandes: 11 communautés locales, toutes en Suisse romande


== Engagement social et politique des évangéliques en Suisse ==
En Suisse romande, plus de cent organisations associatives sont évangéliques. Indépendantes de l'état, ces associations s'impliquent dans différents domaines humanitaires et sociaux. Une des œuvres les plus connues est l'Armée du Salut, qui aide les démunis et les marginalisés dans de nombreux pays.
Henry Dunant, fondateur de la Croix-Rouge, était de confession protestant évangélique. Il fut le premier secrétaire de l'Alliance évangélique de Genève, aujourd'hui appelé Réseau évangélique suisse
Sur le plan politique, les évangéliques défendent la liberté de conscience et la liberté de religion pour tous. Ils s'opposent au prosélytisme et soutiennent le droit de chacun à exprimer et à partager sa foi publiquement ou en privé, dans le respect du choix d'autrui.
Les évangéliques ne votent pas plus à un extrême ou à un autre de l'échiquier politique, ils se situent dans la même moyenne que le reste de la population (la grande diversité au sein des évangéliques en est la raison principale).
En Suisse, il existe deux partis politiques se fondant sur des valeurs évangéliques : le Parti évangélique suisse (PEV) et l'Union démocratique fédérale (UDF).


== Réseau évangélique suisse ==
L'instance qui représente les évangéliques en Suisse s'appelle le Réseau évangélique suisse (RES). Son siège romand est à Genève.
Le rôle du RES est d'offrir une plateforme aux évangéliques de Suisse.


== Dérives sectaires ==
En Suisse, les Églises évangéliques portent souvent, à tort, une image extérieure de secte. Elles ne sont pas des sectes, même si elles ne sont pas reconnue comme religions officielles, ce qui crée un flou autour de ses formes et ses appellations. Cette image est due à plusieurs raisons. Tout d'abord, il y a la nature de ces Églises qui sont indépendantes de l'État, a contrario des Églises officielles, soit l'Église catholique romaine et les Églises évangéliques réformées, c'est-à-dire, les Églises protestantes. Cette séparation d'avec l'État a marqué, surtout au XIXe siècle, une certaine méfiance qui est restée marquée comme une empreinte jusqu'au XXIe siècle. Le contrôle de la vie des fidèles et des positions conservatrices dans le domaine de la vie en société, pour le droit à l'avortement, par exemple, rendent les Eglises peut attrayante, et même repoussantes. L'intolérance qu'elles ont subie a provoqué, durant le XXe siècle, un repli sur elles-mêmes, les rendant un peu plus distantes encore du reste de la population suisse, et accentuant cette image sectaire.
Néanmoins, si ces Églises ne sont pas des sectes, il y a eu, dans les plus charismatiques ou exaltées d'entre elles, des dérives sectaires. Dans les années 1970, Jean-Michel Cravanzola fonde le mouvement Jean-Michel et son équipe. En son sein, il y pratique une application ultra-rigoriste des évangiles et exige de ses membres une soumission totale et un dépouillement financier. En 1979, il est condamné par le tribunal correctionnel de Lausanne pour escroquerie en bande organisée. Néanmoins, son mouvement va perdurer jusqu'en 1992.
Ce genre de personnes accentue, à nouveau, l'image sectaire de l'ensemble des Églises évangéliques, bien qu'elles ne soient absolument pas représentatives du mouvement évangélique suisse. Ceci n'étant toutefois pas le propre des Églises évangéliques, puisque de telles dérives sectaires se sont aussi produites, durant la même période post-1968, dans les Églises « officielles ». C'est notamment le cas de l'Église catholique avec la communauté des Béatitudes en France voisine. Le Réseau évangélique suisse reconnaît toutefois qu'aucun de ses membres et de ses communautés n'est à l'abri de dérives sectaires.

767,"Malleval est une commune française située dans le département de la Loire en région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Elle fait partie du parc naturel régional du Pilat.


== Géographie ==
Malleval est située dans l'aire urbaine de Vienne et dans son unité urbaine. C'est une petite cité médiévale accrochée à un éperon rocheux dominant les gorges du Batalon dans le massif du Pilat.
La commune possède un micro-climat méditerranéen et possède de fait des cactus Opuntia humifusa à l'état sauvage.


== Histoire ==
Le château de Malaval est mentionné dès 1157 et le village est à la fin du XIIIe siècle une châtellenie, possession de la maison de Forez. Renaud de Forez, fils cadet de Jean de Forez, se destine d'abord à devenir prêtre mais en 1324, il épouse Marguerite de Savoie. Devenu riche par son mariage, il agrandit son domaine par l'achat des paroisses de Chavanay et de Pélussin. À cette époque le château s'embellit et Malleval se développe. Cette période est de courte durée car Renaud ne laisse pas d'héritier et devient fou après avoir été fait prisonnier à la bataille de Brignais.
À la fin du XVIe siècle, lors des guerres de religion, le Baron de Bressieu ravagea le village et le vida de tous ses habitants.


== Politique et administration ==


== Démographie ==
L'évolution du nombre d'habitants est connue à travers les recensements de la population effectués dans la commune depuis 1793. À partir du 1er janvier 2009, les populations légales des communes sont publiées annuellement dans le cadre d'un recensement qui repose désormais sur une collecte d'information annuelle, concernant successivement tous les territoires communaux au cours d'une période de cinq ans. Pour les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants, une enquête de recensement portant sur toute la population est réalisée tous les cinq ans, les populations légales des années intermédiaires étant quant à elles estimées par interpolation ou extrapolation. Pour la commune, le premier recensement exhaustif entrant dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif a été réalisé en 2007,.
En 2014, la commune comptait 580 habitants, en augmentation de 6,62 % par rapport à 2009 (Loire : 1,48 % , France hors Mayotte : 2,49 %)


== Lieux et monuments ==

Malleval, cité médiévale, garde un héritage important de son passé comme l'église, le petit-château, le grenier à sel ou la commanderie.
L'église possède une abside du XIIe siècle, des chapelles des XVIe et XVIIIe siècles et un clocher daté de 1614.
Le « saut de Laurette » ou « saut de Lorette » est une cascade de dix mètres de haut qui est à l'origine d'une légende locale, selon laquelle une jeune bergère prénommée Lorette refusait les avances du seigneur romain local. Un jour, alors que celui-ci la poursuivait, elle préféra s'élancer du haut de la cascade pour lui échapper, mais le seigneur et son cheval la suivirent dans sa chute, s'écriant « Mal va ! », qui deviendrait l'étymologie de Malleval. Une version raconterait que Laurette survécu, une autre que les trois périrent,.

768,"Timothy Eugene « Legs » Legler (né le 26 décembre 1966 à Washington D.C.) est un joueur américain professionnel de basket-ball de NBA puis consultant sur ESPN.


== Université ==
Legler rejoint l'Université La Salle, où il devient Academic All-American et inscrit 1 699 points en quatre saisons. Il est l'un des 17 joueurs de l'histoire de l'école à marquer au moins 1 000 points en carrière, et l'un des trois à être nommé Academic All-American. Legler mène La Salle au titre du National Invitation Tournament 1987 au Madison Square Garden, et à la qualification du tournoi NCAA 1988. Il est intronisé au Philadelphia Big 5 Hall of Fame en 1995.


== Sa Carrière (1988-2000) ==
Legler joue en NBA au poste d'arrière shooteur de 1989 à 2000 avec entre temps quelques passages en Continental Basketball Association (CBA), United States Basketball League (USBL) et même en France. Tim Legler effectue un passage au CSP Limoges en 1992. Mais sa période la plus marquante fut probablement à Washington, où il joue quatre saisons, avec les Washington Bullets - franchise qui prend le de nom de Washington Wizards lors de ses deux dernières années - de 1995 à 1999. Il dispute sa meilleure saison en 1995-1996 où il termine premier de la ligue au pourcentage de réussite à 3-points, second au ratio de balles perdues, et il remporta le Three-point Shootout lors du NBA All-Star Game 1996. Il y détient le record de points inscrits sur trois tours (23, 22 et 20 sur un total possible de 30) soit 65 points (sur un total possible de 90).
Legler est réputé comme très bon shooteur à 3-points, en en réussissant 260 sur 604 tentés en carrière, soit une moyenne de 43 %. Cela le place au quatrième rang de l'histoire de la ligue des joueurs ayant terminés leur carrière, derrière Steve Kerr, Hubert Davis et Drazen Petrovic, et dans le Top 10 en comptabilisant les joueurs encore en activité. Legler évolue également sous les couleurs des Phoenix Suns, des Denver Nuggets, des Utah Jazz, des Dallas Mavericks et des Golden State Warriors. Sa carrière se termine à cause d'une blessure récurrente au genou.


== ESPN ==
Legler apparaît régulièrement dans les programmes de ESPN NBA Shootaround, NBA Fastbreak, NBA Coast to Coast et en tant que consultant pour SportsCenter et dans diverses émissions sur ESPN Radio. Il travaille sur cette chaîne depuis 2002.

772,"Dans le monde de la tauromachie, afeitado (« rasage » en espagnol) désigne l’épointage des cornes du toro de lidia, et leur « arrangement » de façon à leur redonner une forme arrondie.


== Description et conséquences ==
C’est une pratique frauduleuse, interdite par le règlement taurin espagnol sur lequel s’appuie le règlement taurin français. Ce règlement était celui de l'Union des Villes Taurines de France que l'on peut lire en grande partie dans l'annexe de « Histoire et dictionnaire de la tauromachie », et qui précise : « En France l'Union des villes taurines, lors de son assemblée générale à Orthez en date du 25 janvier 1998, a édicté un règlement qui se base sur les textes espagnols et qui est applicable dans toutes les arènes adhérentes ». Outre la supercherie indigne de l’art du toreo, l’afeitado, en ôtant le diamant ou partie dure de la corne, entraîne l’éclatement des cornes au moindre choc. Ceci explique le nombre de toros astillados qui sortent du toril avec les cornes éclatées en forme de plumeau. D’autre part, ces manipulations qui fatiguent l’animal sont souvent la cause de la faiblesse de ses pattes.


== Historique ==
Le règlement taurin espagnol confie la vérification des cornes au Service Vétérinaire de la Police, mission qualifiée de « délicate » par Paul Casanova et Pierre Dupuy, qui signalent que cette pratique n’est pas récente. La plus grave blessure que le torero Domingo Ortega ait reçue dans les années 1930 venait d’un taureau afeité. La fraude était encore assez rare à cette époque-là. Mais elle a pris une ampleur considérable après la guerre civile espagnole. Manolete a d’ailleurs été tué par un taureau diminué, .
Les divers règlements précisés depuis le 10 février 1953 punissent sévèrement cette fraude sans toutefois parvenir à y mettre fin. Le dernier mot reste au public qui, par ses protestations, peut exiger un changement de taureau lorsqu’il constate que l’animal n’est pas complet.

773,"La Ligue mondiale 2007 s'est déroulée du 25 mai au 15 juillet 2007. La phase intercontinentale a duré jusqu'au 8 juillet. Seront qualifiées pour la phase finale les premières équipes de chaque poule, ainsi que le pays organisateur, soit la Pologne, et une équipe invitée par la FIVB


== Tour intercontinental ==
Chaque poule se joue en formule « championnat », où chaque équipe rencontre les trois autres en double aller-retour (deux matches à l'aller, deux matches en retour, chaque paire de match en un week-end). Chaque équipe joue donc douze matches. Se qualifient pour le tour suivant les vainqueurs des quatre poules et une équipe désignée par une wild-card. Si la Pologne, organisatrice qualifiée d'office pour la phase finale participant au tour intercontinental, remporte sa poule, est qualifiée l'équipe ayant obtenu la deuxième place dans la même poule.

778,"En architecture, le mot appareil, ou opus en latin, est un terme qui désigne la façon dont les moellons, les pierres de taille ou les briques sont assemblés dans la maçonnerie.
L'appareilleur est le principal ouvrier chargé de l'appareil des pierres d'un bâtiment. C'est lui qui trace les épures par panneaux ou par équarrissement, qui préside à la pose au raccordement, etc..
L’appareillage désigne l'action d'appareiller les murs.


== Définition ==
On appelle appareil en architecture le dessin, la taille et la pose des pierres d'un édifice. On dit d'une muraille qu'elle est d'un bel appareil lorsque les pierres taillées avec précision, toutes de même épaisseur et quelquefois de même longueur, sont placées de manière a ce que les joints de maçonnerie soient égaux et disposés convenablement « pour la solidité de l'ouvrage et l'agrément de la vue ». Les matériaux bien choisis et bien ajustés indiquent toujours un art très avancé.
Bien qu'il existe une multitude d'appareils on peut toujours les rapporter à des types principaux qui ont été désignés selon des noms grecs ou latins. L’usage s’est imposé dans la littérature archéologique de donner le nom d’« opus » aussi bien à la structure considérée dans son ensemble (« opus caementicium ») qu’à ses faces parementées (« opus incertum ou opus reticulatum »), ce qui prête inévitablement à confusion dans la dénomination définitive des appareils. L'appareil est pour l'archéologue un élément de datation d'un mur.


== Classement ==
Dans les constructions romaines et dans celles des premiers siècles du Moyen Âge jusques et y compris le XIe siècle qui n'ont guère été que des modifications plus ou moins altérées des premières on trouve fréquemment le mélange de la pierre et de brique ou celui de pierres de diverses couleurs, etc.. Ces mélanges ainsi que la forme de divers appareils ont été souvent mis à profit par les anciens pour animer la surface des murs.


=== Appareils rectangulaires (à joint vif) ===
L'appareil antique grec est constitué de pierres rectangulaires, de taille précisément ajustée, souvent reliées entre elles par des agrafes de bronze ou de plomb coulés. Les éléments sont disposés en assises alternées.
Dans l'architecture romaine, cet assemblage de pierres rectangulaires taillées à joint vif est appelé opus quadratum.
Les trois appareils rectangulaires qui se montrent ordinairement soit dans les constructions romaines soit dans celles des premiers siècles du Moyen Âge sont le grand appareil, le moyen appareil et le petit appareil. Le grand appareil en pierres de 61 cm à 1,60 m posées horizontalement par assises régulières jointes intérieurement, par des crampons de fer ou de bronze ou de simples queues d'aronde ou d'hironde en bois ou en métal auxquels on substitue quelquefois des os de bœuf ou de mouton. Le moyen appareil formé de pierres ordinaires assemblées comme celles du grand appareil par des queues d'arondes ou liées par le ciment. Le petit appareil formé de petit moellons cubiques de 8 à 10 centimètres ou de 10 à 13 centimètres posés par assises sur un épaisse couche de mortier et à joints verticaux également larges tantôt par files longitudinales, tantôt par recouvrement. Quelquefois vers l'époque romano-byzantine le moellon au lieu d'être cubique devient cunéiforme et s'engage par sa pointe dans la maçonnerie.
D'autres sources rapportent les dimensions suivantes[réf. nécessaire]:
petit appareil : appareil constitué de moellons, pierres ou briques d'une dimension (hauteur d'une assise) inférieure à 20 cm;
appareil moyen : appareil constitué d'éléments ayant une dimension entre 20 cm et 30 cm;
grand appareil : appareil constitué d'éléments de plus de 30 cm;
appareil cyclopéen : appareil constitué de pierres énormes comme les murs de Mycènes (Mur cyclopéen).


=== Opus caementicium romain ===

L'opus caementicium constitue le massif, le noyau, la partie structurelle de la maçonnerie romaine qui succède à l'opus quadratum. Les parements appareillés de différentes façons, sont désignés séparément. Ce massif de remplissage est constitué d'un mortier de chaux mêlé de caementa, qui désignent des pierres, des moellons tout venant. Les parements, servent de coffrage perdu. Selon le parement, on distingue, par ordre chronologique d'apparition:
Dans l'architecture de la Rome antique
l'opus incertum, il n'y a pas de régularité;
l'opus quasi reticulatum, les pierres sont disposées en damier diagonal irrégulier;
l'opus reticulatum, les pierres sont carrées et de même taille, elles constituent un damier parfait en lignes diagonales;
l'opus mixtum, un chaînage de briques alterne avec un appareil de pierres régulier;
l'opus latericium, aussi appelé opus testaceum;
l'opus vittatum;
l'opus sectile, qui se rapproche de la mosaïque.
Dans l'architecture pré-romane
Dans l'architecture préromane s'ajoute l'opus spicatum (« appareil en épi de blé »), constitué d'éléments posés sur leur champ, en lignes inclinées alternativement à droite et à gauche, figurant un motif en épi de blé ou en branche de fougère ou encore en arêtes de poisson. C'est un appareil de brique utilisé pour les sols. On le trouve également dans les murs carolingiens;
l' appareil en arête-de-poisson , constitué de pierres plates inclinées à environ 45°, en changeant de sens à chaque strate successive, de manière à donner un aspect d'« arête de poisson ».
Dans l'architecture romane

l'opus monspelliensis est réalisé en alternant assises de « boutisses » (pierres dont la plus petite face forme parement) et assises de « carreaux » (pierres dont la plus grande face forme parement)
Dans l'architecture byzantine
l'appareil cloisonné, réalisé en cloisonnant chaque pierre avec des briques plates.


=== Classement en fonction de la régularité des pierres ===
On distingue appareil régulier et appareil irrégulier.
Appareil régulier à assises réglées
Selon le Dicobat (dictionnaire général du bâtiment), une maçonnerie en liaison, ou réglée désigne un appareillage dans lequel chaque joint vertical tombe exactement au milieu du bloc ou de la pierre du lit inférieur (syn.: appareil plein-sur-joint). Autrement dit, il s'agit d'une maçonnerie assisée (équarrie), dans laquelle chaque joint vertical tombe au milieu du lit horizontal du bloc de l'assise inférieure.
Toujours selon le Dicobat, un appareil plein-sur-joint se dit d'un appareil réglé dans lequel chaque joint montant est exactement au milieu des éléments des assises inférieure et supérieure.
Selon le Larousse, un appareil plein-sur-joint se dit d'un appareillage de pierre ou de brique à joints contrariés, où chaque élément d'une assise est à cheval sur deux éléments de l'assise inférieure.
Ces différentes définitions recouvrent de fait la même réalité constructive et renvoient aux Règles de l'art et aux bonnes pratiques en matière de techniques de construction.


== Position des éléments dans l'appareil ==
On distingue cinq types d'élément de maçonnerie taillé ou moulé (pierres de taille, moellon, brique, etc.) en fonction de leur position dans l'appareil :
panneresse : Élément de maçonnerie dont la face intermédiaire entre la plus grande et la plus petite forme parement, par opposition au carreau dont la plus grande face est en parement, et à la boutisse dont la plus petite face est vue.
carreau : Élément de maçonnerie dont les dimensions de parement sont importantes par rapport aux faces de joint ou de queue (partie d'un moellon noyée dans la maçonnerie, dont la longueur se mesure depuis le parement). Le carreau de plâtre ou de béton cellulaire est destiné à la construction des cloisons ou de doublages, ces éléments normalisés mesurent 666 × 500 mm, pour des épaisseurs de 4 à 10 cm.
boutisse : Élément de maçonnerie dont la plus petite face forme parement. Si elle traverse le mur, on parle de boutisse parpaigne ou traversante ou encore traversière.
parpaing : Élément de maçonnerie qui présente un parement sur chacune des deux faces opposées d'un mur. Le parpaing assure la fonction de chaînage (cohésion d'ensemble) de la maçonnerie, il est important d'en mettre suffisamment (pour un mur en moellon, en prévoir un par m²). Par métonymie, on appelle souvent « parpaing » les blocs de béton, qui s'appareillent effectivement en parpaing.
blocaille, bloquaille ou blocaux : Pierres sans forme précise de format moyen, trop petites pour être assisées en parement mais utilisées en blocage (noyées dans un bain de mortier entre deux parois appareillées).


== Maçonnerie de brique ==


=== Appareil courant ===
L'arrangement des briques pour obtenir de bonnes liaisons varie suivant l'épaisseur des murs.
Dans les murs composés dans le sens de leur épaisseur d'une seule brique posée de champ ou à plat les briques s'arrangent par lits horizontaux les joints verticaux d'un lit portant toujours sur le milieu ou le tiers des briques du lit inférieur.
L'appareil courant tout panneresse (à mi-brique, demi-brique ou à la grecque) présente des briques à plat où les joints verticaux alternent avec la moitié de la longueur de la brique.

L'appareil courant ou en boutisse:


=== Appareils composés ===
Dans les murs d'une brique boutisse d'épaisseur, les briques peuvent être déjà combinées d'un grand nombre de manières. Il faudrait aussi citer les maçonneries en relief. Nom de différents appareils :
appareil anglais,
appareil à mi-brique (demi-brique, tout panneresses ou à la grecque),
appareil en carrelage,
appareil en chaîne,
appareil en croix ou croisé,
appareil debout,
appareil flamand,
appareil français,
appareil hollandais,
appareil en quart de brique,
appareil sauvage,
maçonneries en relief, etc.


== Appareils de décoration ==

Appareils moins courants en parement, plus employé comme dessous de voute ou en revêtement de sol.
Appareil en arête-de-poisson
appareil en épi (Opus spicatum),
appareil anglais ou bâtard,
appareil à bâtons rompus,
appareil mixte, etc.

780,"Mohammad Dinah Salifou Camara, mort le 21 octobre 1897, est le dernier roi des Nalous, un peuple de Guinée. Il est souvent présenté comme l'une des grandes figures de la résistance à la pénétration coloniale en Afrique subsaharienne, mais doit aussi une certaine notoriété à sa participation remarquée à l'Exposition universelle de 1889 à Paris. À la fin de sa vie il fut exilé à Saint-Louis-du-Sénégal, assigné à résidence où il mourut, dans la misère. Dinah Salifou était titulaire de la Légion d'honneur.


== Biographie ==
Dinah Salifou est née vers 1830 dans le Fouta Djallon. Elevé dans la tradition musulmane, il est le fils du premier roi des Nalous, Boya Salifou et de Makoumba. Après avoir été le digne ministre de son prédécesseur et oncle le roi Youra Tawel, Dinah Salifou lui succéda à sa mort (désigné par l'autorité coloniale française) et régna à partir du 31 août 1885 sur le royaume Nalou (rives du rio Nunez en Guinée). Il fut l'un des seuls rois africains des Rivières du Sud, si ce n'est le seul, à être invité à Paris pour l'Exposition universelle de 1889. Il embarqua avec sa suite (composé de 32 personnes) sur le Goéland et après un voyage de plusieurs jours arriva le 25 juin à Marseille.
Accueilli avec les honneurs à la gare de Lyon, il fut logé pendant plus d'un mois dans un hôtel particulier de la rue Fabert à Paris et devint une personnalité importante et convoitée par les parisiens. Le 7 juillet 1889 Dinah Salifou fait la une de plusieurs journaux, donc le supplément illustré du Petit Parisien, entouré de sa jeune femme Philis et de l'un de ses fils, Ibrahima.
Choyé par le gouvernement colonial, il fut invité à la Tour Eiffel, à l'opéra de Paris (ou il rencontra le Sha de Perse, qui lui offrira plus tard un sabre ornée de pierres précieuses) et enfin à l'Elysée, invité par le président Sadi Carnot.
Mais avant sa mésaventure à Paris, il réussit ce que personne avant lui n'avait pu faire : réconcilier tous les peuples de la région de Boké (du cap Verga au rio Nunez allant jusqu'aux îles Tristao). Toute le Kakandé reconnaît en lui le guerrier qu'il a été et le grand roi qu'il fut.
C'est de son voyage à Paris que tous ses problèmes s'enchaînèrent. En effet, pendant son absence, les troubles reprirent de plus belle dans le Rio Nunez, à l'instigation de son cousin Tocba. Allant de trahisons en rébellions, il conclut une alliance avec le roi du Fouta Djallon pour se débarrasser une fois pour toutes de tous ses ennemis du Naloutaye, du Landoumataye, jusqu'au Bagataye, « tout le Victoria et au delà », qui, par jalousie et en semant la terreur, souhaitaient lui succéder. Le temps de la désillusion arriva avec le colon français. Car il faut le savoir, le roi Dinah Salifou était grand ministre et grand roi parce qu'il respectait tous les traités (ou presque) signés avec les colons. Trahi, c'est d'ailleurs pour avoir combattu, et perdu sans l'accord total du colon (mais sous ordre officieux du commandant français Opigez) que le roi fut déporté en 1890 à Saint-Louis-du-Sénégal et assigné à résidence.
Multipliant les demandes de bienveillance auprès du gouvernement colonial, Dinah ne fut jamais entendu, les autorités décidant juste de lui verser une pension (qui sera diminué de moitié au fil de son exil). Sa famille le retrouva par la suite dans son exil forcé dont il ne revint jamais, puisqu'il mourut à l'hôpital militaire de Saint-Louis le 21 octobre 1897.
Décrit comme très intelligent, fier et redoutable guerrier, assoiffé d’ambition et fidèle aux français, Dinah avait été un roi respecté de tous, et avait convertit de nombreux Nalous à l’Islam.
Acclamé et respecté par les plus hautes instances, c’est son voyage à Paris, sous couvert de gloire qui lui valut sa chute. Naïf quelques fois, trahit par les français, jalousé par quelques membres de sa famille, il est aujourd'hui considéré comme un héros dans son pays, à l'instar de Samory Touré ou Alpha Yaya.


== Postérité ==

Son fils, formé à l'École des fils de chefs de Saint-Louis, fut lieutenant d'infanterie de marine au 8e, puis 58e régiment d'infanterie coloniale. Blessé à deux reprises en Champagne ainsi qu'aux Dardanelles, il gagna ses galons sur le front et fut cité pour son mérite à l'ordre des armées. Il reçut à son tour, la légion d'honneur le 20 janvier 1916 lors d'une prise d'armes aux Invalides, ainsi que la croix de guerre.

Wilier Triestina a été fondé en 1906 à Bassano del Grappa par Pietro Dal Molin. Dans le passé ont couru sur un vélo Wilier des champions comme Fiorenzo Magni et Marco Pantani. Wilier est l'acronyme de « W l’Italia liberata e redenta » qui signifie en français: « Longue vie à l'Italie libre et rachetée » puisque W remplace Viva.
Actuellement, l'équipe Lampre-ISD utilise un vélo Wilier, qui a comme athlètes les plus représentatifs Marco Pantani ,Damiano Cunego, Alessandro Petacchi et Michele Scarponi.
Au mois de novembre 2012, la direction annonce un accord avec la formation sud-américaine Colombia pour leur fournir les bicyclettes de la marque. L'entreprise de la province de Vicence parie sur les jeunes coureurs colombiens et leur affirmation sur la scène internationale. Du point de vue commercial, Andrea Gastaldello, administrateur délégué, montre le côté stratégique de la collaboration, l'Amérique du Sud étant un marché avec une croissance potentielle importante.

795,"Christian Saint-Roch, né le 1er avril 1948 à Montréal, et mort le 6 avril 2014 à Châteauguay, est un musicien et compositeur québécois. Il est connu comme batteur de rock progressif québécois aussi bien que comme compositeur pour de célèbres chanteurs québécois, principalement durant les années 1970.


== Biographie ==
Christian Saint-Roch provient d'une famille artistique : il est le fils de André « Tom » Saint-Roch, saxophoniste de jazz montréalais et de Hélène Gagnon-Saint-Roch, danseuse et professeur de français-théâtre ; son frère, Frantz Saint-Roch, est aussi saxophoniste et chef d'orchestre,.
Multi-instrumentiste et batteur de jazz depuis sa tendre enfance, il entreprend une brève carrière, de chanteur de variété. [réf. souhaitée]. Dans les années soixante[évasif] il se retrouve à la batterie, son instrument de prédilection, accompagnant le groupe Les Baronets dans lequel chante alors René Angélil. Il se retrouve ensuite dans le monde des chansonniers québécois en devenant le batteur de Jean-Pierre Ferland sous la direction artistique de Franck Dervieux. Ferland ayant abandonné son chef d'orchestre pour l'écriture de l'album Jaune, Saint-Roch se retrouve à la batterie pour l'album Dimension M de Dervieux, disque culte considéré par certains comme premier album de rock progressif québécois de calibre international.
Dervieux souffrant du cancer, Saint-Roch est batteur sur le premier disque du groupe Contraction formé avec d'autres musiciens de l'album Dimension M sous l'influence de Dervieux, mais il est alors embauché par Robert Charlebois, alors « au zénith de sa gloire » avec son orchestre composé de Christian St-Roch à la batterie, Bill Gagnon à la basse, Marcel Beauchamp et Michel Robidoux aux guitares, ainsi que Michel Séguin aux percussions,; ils feront les disques Fu Man Chu et Solidaritude.
Simultanément il compose Le monde est fou, avec des paroles de Luc Plamondon, pour Renée Claude qui paraîtra avec trois autres compositions avec Plamondon sur l'album Ce soir je fais l'amour avec toi en 1973. Diane Dufresne décidera en 1979 de reprendre la conclusion de cette pièce, L'hymne à la beauté du monde, et d'en faire une chanson à part entière. L'œuvre est aussi ré-enregistrée en 1998 par Isabelle Boulay, et est reprise en spectacle par plusieurs interprètes.
Il participe ensuite à la création du Ville-Émard Blues Band, dont les autres musiciens de Charlebois, de Contraction et quelques autres forment le noyau dur. Il joue ou partage alors la batterie avec Denis Farmer et Marcel Huot. Il joue aussi de l'orgue, compose et chante dans ce groupe qui se rendra jusqu'au forum de Montréal et qui marquera la musique québécoise dans son ensemble, formant « le chaînon manquant entre Robert Charlebois et Harmonium ».
Il signe encore quelques compositions marquantes pour Renée Claude dont la « très jolie » Si tu viens dans mon pays et Je recommence à vivre, compose quelques succès pour Julie Arel (C'est bon, Nos amours) et Véronique Béliveau (L'été) mais il gagne surtout le concours de la chanson officielle des Jeux olympiques d'été de 1976 avec la chanson Je t'aime, sur des paroles de Jean Robitaille et interprétée par Estelle Sainte-Croix, . En 1979, encore une fois sur des paroles de Luc Plamondon, Saint-Roch compose les chansons Fellini et Le Parc Belmont qui paraîtront sur l'album Strip Tease de Diane Dufresne, qui inclut aussi L'hymne à la beauté du monde.
En 1981 il lance son premier et seul disque solo, Romance, un instrumental.
Christian Saint-Roch a composé aussi pour les chanteurs québécois,,,, : Emmanuëlle, Mario Pelchat, René Simard, Fabienne Thibeault et Francesca Gagnon (en).
Il décède d'un cancer généralisé en 2014 à l'âge de 66 ans. Peu après sa mort, en mai 2014, L'hymne à la beauté du monde fait partie des « chansons qui ont marqué le temps » au sein de l'exposition Musique: le Québec de Robert Charlebois à Arcade Fire au musée McCord à Montréal.

798,"La Question du grenier au parchemin de l'Université de Paris est un épisode du XVIe siècle concernant l'université de Paris.


== Histoire ==
Une fois par an, au mois de juin, la foire au parchemin avait lieu pendant les fêtes du Lendit, dans la plaine Saint-Denis.
L'Université partageait avec les parcheminiers du roi le privilège de choisir, la première, la quantité qui lui était nécessaire. C'est seulement lorsque l'Université était pourvue que les débitants ordinaires pouvaient faire leur provision.
Le recteur de l'Université touchait encore un droit sur la vente du parchemin. Il fallait qu'il pût la contrôler et estampiller les feuilles, car les parcheminiers, pour se soustraire à cet impôt, faisaient souvent entrer des liasses en fraude; une halle au parchemin avait donc été complaisamment offerte à l'Université par les Mathurins.
Cette servitude fit l'objet de contestations: en effet, après avoir longtemps donné une hospitalité gratuite au parchemin universitaire, les moines avaient demandé en 1537 qu'on leur payât un loyer. Leur réclamation fut entendue, et ce débours fut pris sur les fonds publics de l'Université. Mais en dépit de cette satisfaction, les religieux voulurent définitivement se débarrasser de ce bail.
Ces religieux n'étaient plus également sensibles à l'honneur de donner l'hospitalité à un corps tel que l'Université. Les pourparlers traînant en longueur, ils y mirent fin en fermant un beau jour la halle au parchemin.
À cette nouvelle, Jean Filesac de concert avec André Mellé convoqua en toute hâte l'Université. On décida d'abord que le parchemin serait logé dans les bâtiments de la Nation à laquelle appartiendrait le recteur ; mais le recteur changeait tous les trois mois, c'eût été faire trop de déménagements. On se résolut donc à louer une salle à cet effet dans un des collèges de l'Université.
Le 20 mai 1586, les quatre Nations chargèrent le trésorier et le recteur de chercher un local et de payer sur les fonds communs les frais du déménagement ; c'est le collège de Justice qui abrita désormais la précieuse denrée.

800,"Adrien Mentienne, né le 23 mars 1841 et mort le 4 octobre 1927 à Bry-sur-Marne (Val-de-Marne), est un historien et archéologue français et ancien maire de Bry-sur-Marne.


== Biographie ==
Adrien Mentienne est né à Bry-sur-Marne en 1841 d'une famille de cultivateurs et entrepreneurs, dont plusieurs membres avaient auparavant occupé des fonctions municipales, tels son père Armand-Louis (premier magistrat de la commune) ou son grand-oncle Louis-Alexandre (1726-1811) qui fut le premier maire de la municipalité fondée en 1790. Il devint lui-même maire de Bry à 27 ans, et a laissé sur cette période des écrits très précis qui sont autant de témoignages importants pour l'histoire de l'Île-de-France d'une part et sur la guerre de 1870 d'autre part..
Entrepreneur de maçonnerie, il fut un passionné d'histoire et d'archéologie, et ses recherches permirent de découvrir un cimetière gallo-romain, alors que d'autres fouilles mirent au jour de nombreux vestiges et ossements dont certaines pièces furent longtemps exposées au musée Carnavalet à Paris, et aujourd'hui dans le musée municipal.
Cofondateur de la Compagnie des Chemins de fer nogentais, il fut l'auteur de plusieurs ouvrages sur l'histoire de la région, ce qui lui valut d'être membre de la Commission du Vieux Paris et de plusieurs sociétés savantes. En tant qu'ami de la famille de Louis Daguerre, il a également écrit sur l'histoire de la photographie. Il est fait Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur en 1919.
Vice-Président du Conseil d'administration des Tramways Nogentais.
Vice-Président de la Société d'Enseignement Moderne de Leopold Bellan.
Membre de la Chambre consultative d'agriculture du Département de la Seine depuis 1877.
Membre de la Société de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'Ile de France.
Membre de la Société pour l'avancement des Sciences.
Il a donné son nom au musée de Bry-sur-Marne, dont il a été maire de 1868 à 1881 puis Conseiller municipal de 1883 à 1892 et de 1908 à 1912.
Il mourut à Bry en 1927 à l'Hôtel de Malestroit dont il était propriétaire.

801,"La rivière Chassé est un affluent de la rive est de la rivière Chaudière laquelle coule vers le nord pour se déverser sur la rive sud du fleuve Saint-Laurent.
La rivière Chassé coule dans les municipalités de Sainte-Marguerite et de Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce, dans la municipalité régionale de comté (MRC) de La Nouvelle-Beauce, dans la région administrative de Chaudière-Appalaches, au Québec, au Canada.


== Géographie ==
Les principaux versants hydrographiques voisins de la rivière Chassé sont:
côté nord: rivière du Moulin, ruisseau du Moulin Bernier, ruisseau Doyon, rivière Etchemin;
côté est: ruisseau Dumont, rivière Desbarats, rivière Etchemin;
côté sud: rivière Chaudière, rivière du Domaine, rivière chez Binet, rivière Morency;
côté ouest: rivière Chaudière.
La rivière Chassé prend sa source en zone forestière et agricole, sur la rive droite de la rivière Chaudière, dans la municipalité de Sainte-Marguerite à 3,1 km à l'est du village. La rivière Chassé s'écoule presque entièrement dans les limites de l'ancienne seigneurie Sainte-Marie en Beauce.
À partir de sa source, la rivière Chassé coule sur 20,5 km répartis selon les segments suivants:
3,5 km vers le sud-ouest, jusqu'à la route 275;
3,9 km vers le sud-ouest, puis le nord-ouest, en recueillant les eaux du cours d'eau Tracy (venant du sud-est), jusqu'à la route 216;
1,7 km vers le nord-ouest, en recueillant les eaux du ruisseau du Rang Sainte-Marguerite (venant du nord-est), jusqu'à une route de campagne;
2,8 km vers l'ouest, jusqu'à une route de campagne;
4,8 km vers le sud-ouest, en recueillant les eaux du ruisseau Audesse (venant du nord), jusqu'à la confluence de la rivière du Domaine;
1,0 km vers l'ouest, jusqu'au chemin du rang Saint-Gabriel-Nord;
0,9 km vers le sud-ouest, jusqu'à l'autoroute 73, soit l'autoroute Robert-Cliche;
1,1 km vers le sud-ouest, jusqu'à la route 173, soit le boulevard Vachon Nord;
0,8 km vers le sud-ouest, en coupant la rue Notre-Dame-Nord, jusqu'à sa confluence.
La rivière Chassé se jette sur la rive est de la rivière Chaudière à 1,9 km en aval du pont du village de Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce, en amont du pont de Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce, à 2,9 km en aval de l'île Perreault et à 6,1 km en amont du pont de Scott. À sa confluence, la rivière Chassé coule dans une vallée qui, en période de hautes eaux, se confond avec le lit de la rivière Chaudière. Les inondations, surtout printanières, sont fréquentes dans ce secteur. Dans l'histoire de la Beauce, les inondations ont causées maints inconvénients à la circulation routière et ferroviaire, particulièrement en 1917 et en 1929.


== Toponymie ==
Jadis, ce cours d'eau était désigné ""rivière du Domaine"", lequel évoque le domaine seigneurial attribué en 1735 au premier seigneur Thomas-Jacques Taschereau. Ce domaine comportait l'ensemble des terres que Taschereau s'était réservées à son propre usage. Ce domaine mesurait 12 arpents de front sur la rivière Chaudière et s'étirait sur 40 arpents en s'éloignant dans les terres. Le domaine comportait un premier manoir ainsi un second moulin banal; le premier moulin avait été construit sur la rive ouest de la rivière Chaudière, sur l'actuelle rivière Vallée laquelle a longtemps été désignée ""Rivière de l'Ancien Moulin"".
Une chapelle dédiée à Sainte-Anne a été érigée à même le domaine sur un terrain cédé par le seigneur Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau, en 1778; l'objectif étant d'éviter les accidents causées par les débordements de la rivière Chaudière. Même au XXIe siècle, l'ensemble des industries établies depuis la fin du XIXe siècle par Charles Chassé et sa famille sont situées au bord de cette rivière: moulins à scie et à carde, complétés avec le temps par des usines fabriquant des boîtes à beurre, des couvertures de laine et autres produits. Le toponyme de la rivière évoque la mémoire de cet homme d'affaires. La première mention cartographique connue date de 1937, soit peu après le mandat à la mairie de Charles Chassé, fils (1927-1933).
Le toponyme rivière Chassé a été officialisé le 5 décembre 1968 à la Commission de toponymie du Québec.

806,"L’Exécutif de la 3e législature de l'Assemblée d'Irlande du Nord (en anglais : Executive of the 3rd Northern Ireland Assembly) est le deuxième Exécutif d'Irlande du Nord entre le 8 mai 2007 et le 16 mai 2011, durant la troisième législature de l'Assemblée.


== Historique du mandat ==
Dirigé par le nouveau Premier ministre unioniste Ian Paisley et le nouveau vice-Premier ministre nationaliste Martin McGuinness, cet exécutif est constitué et soutenu par une coalition consociationaliste entre le Parti unioniste démocrate (DUP), le Sinn Féin (SF), le Parti unioniste d'Ulster (UUP) et le Parti social-démocrate et travailliste (SDLP). Ensemble, ils disposent de 98 députés sur 108, soit 90,7 % des sièges de l'Assemblée.
Il est formé à la suite des élections législatives du 7 mars 2007.
Juridiquement, il succède à l'Exécutif de la 2e législature, mais les institutions dévolues étaient en réalité sous administration directe du gouvernement britannique depuis le 14 octobre 2002.
Au cours du scrutin parlementaire, le DUP conforte sa position de premier parti du territoire et de principale force unioniste, tandis que le SF devient la deuxième formation politique nord-irlandaise et confirme sa position de premier parti nationaliste. Le 26 mars, date limite fixée par la loi sur l'Irlande du Nord pour établir la répartition des portefeuilles ministériels, le Parti unioniste démocrate et le Sinn Féin annoncent vouloir gouverner ensemble et former un nouvel Exécutif à compter du 8 mai. Dans la journée, une loi du Parlement du Royaume-Uni approuve ce délai de six semaines et l'Exécutif de la 3e législature est constitué à la date prévue.
Paisley annonce le 4 mars 2008 qu'il compte démissionner de la direction du DUP et abandonner celle du gouvernement dévolu. Le ministre des Finances Peter Robinson est élu pour lui succéder comme chef de parti le 17 avril 2008 et de l'Exécutif le 5 juin, ce qui occasionne quatre jours plus tard un remaniement ministériel.
Robinson fait savoir le 11 janvier 2010 qu'il suspend ses activités pendant six semaines, afin que sa fonction ne soit pas affectée par le scandale financier impliquant son épouse Iris, députée à l'Assemblée et à la Chambre des communes. Lavé de tout soupçon par le conseiller juridique de ses services, il reprend ses responsabilités dès le 3 février.
Le 12 avril suivant, le chef du Parti de l'Alliance de l'Irlande du Nord (APNI) David Ford est élu par l'Assemblée ministre de la Justice. Ce poste étant très sensible puisqu'il exerce la tutelle du Service de police d'Irlande du Nord (PSNI), il est attribué à une personnalité qui ne se trouve pas identifiée comme unioniste ou nationaliste. À cette occasion, l'APNI rejoint la majorité parlementaire. L'Exécutif dispose donc 105 députés sur 108, soit 97,2 % des sièges de l'Assemblée.
À la suite des élections législatives du 5 mai 2011, la répartition des forces politiques est confirmée. L'Exécutif de la 4e législature est formé moins de deux semaines plus tard, toujours sous la direction partagée de Robinson et McGuinness.

807,"La gare d'Évry - Courcouronnes est une gare ferroviaire française de la ligne de Grigny à Corbeil-Essonnes, située dans la commune d'Évry (département de l'Essonne).
C'est une gare de la Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF) desservie par les trains de la ligne D du RER. Elle se situe à une distance de 30,9 km de Paris-Gare de Lyon.


== La gare ==

La gare, située au point kilométrique (PK) 7,008 de la ligne de Grigny à Corbeil-Essonnes, est desservie par les trains de la ligne D du RER. La gare est souterraine et comporte quatre points de sortie : sortie de nuit, sortie par le hall principal (où se trouvent les guichets Île-de-France, Grandes lignes et quelques commerces), sortie cours Blaise-Pascal ou sortie desserte Paul-Sabatier complètement à l'est.
Cette gare est assez fréquentée, située en centre-ville, non loin de la préfecture de l'Essonne, de la cathédrale d'Évry, de l'université d'Évry-Val d'Essonne, du centre commercial régional Évry 2 et de la mosquée d'Évry-Courcouronnes.
À l'occasion de l'inauguration du nouveau pôle intermodal d'Évry - Courcouronnes, l'annonce officielle du changement de nom de deux des trois gares de la ville d'Évry a été faite. La gare d'Évry-Courcouronnes s'appellera désormais Évry-Centre et la gare d'Évry s'appellera Évry-Val-de-Seine. Ce changement était attendu tant la confusion et les erreurs étaient nombreuses entre les deux gares qui ne sont pas sur le même tronçon de la ligne. Beaucoup de voyageurs sont descendus à la petite gare d'Évry-Val-de-Seine en pensant être à la gare d'Évry-Courcouronnes.
Le renommage de la gare s’effectue progressivement. Depuis le mois d'octobre 2009, des autocollants ont été posés sur les panneaux de quais pour remplacer le mot « Préfecture » par « Centre ». La gare s’appelle pour le moment « Evry-Courcouronnes Centre ». C’est ainsi d’ailleurs que cette gare est énoncée dans le Système d'information voyageurs embarqué. Son nom définitif sera Évry-Centre.
En 2014, selon les estimations de la SNCF, la fréquentation annuelle de la gare est de 8 741 664 voyageurs.


=== Architecture ===
L'architecte de la gare est Bernard Hamburger, fils de Jean Hamburger et Annette Haas et frère de Michel Berger,.


== Le pôle intermodal ==
Après plusieurs mois de travaux, de mai 2007 à décembre 2008, la rénovation de la gare est terminée et le nouveau pôle intermodal d'Évry - Courcouronnes est inauguré le 23 mars 2009 par Jacques Reiller préfet de l'Essonne, par Manuel Valls maire d'Évry et Stéphane Beaudet maire de Courcouronnes et par les représentants du Conseil général de l'Essonne, du STIF, de la SNCF et de RFF.

La rénovation de la gare concerne principalement le bâtiment de la gare : extérieurs et intérieurs, ainsi que ses accès et les cheminements à l'intérieur du bâtiment. L'éclairage, la signalitique, les dispositifs d'informations tels que les écrans ont été modernisés.
La rénovation a été réalisée dans le cadre du Plan de déplacements urbains en Île-de-France. Les travaux ont été principalement réalisés sous les maîtrises d'ouvrage de :
la SNCF pour le réaménagement du bâtiment de la gare ferroviaire ;
la DDE pour le renforcement de la structure du bâtiment ;
la Communauté d'agglomération Évry Centre Essonne pour le réaménagement des deux gares routières ;
la Communauté d'agglomération, le SMITEC et la société d'économie mixte TICE pour la construction de l'Agence de Bus Centre Essonne ;
Réseau ferré de France pour les accès aux quais.
La partie souterraine de la gare n'est pas concernée et devrait faire l'objet d'une rénovation qui n'est pas encore planifiée ni financée.
Des travaux de rénovation de la gare annexe sont en cours de réalisation et seront livrés en octobre 2009.
Le nouveau pôle intermodal comprend sur trois niveaux :
la gare SNCF desservie par 192 trains par jour, avec 8 trains par heure et par sens aux heures de pointe ;
deux gares routières desservies par 23 lignes de bus et de cars desservants 20 communes du département ;
un parking de 440 places (payant depuis le 1er juin 2009) ;
une station de taxis ;
une aire de dépose minute ;
des services liés aux transports.
En décembre 2014, a été inaugurée la mise en accessibilité de la gare. Les travaux ont consisté notamment à rehausser les quais, à mettre aux normes les ascenseurs, à poser quatre nouvelles rampes d’accès pour les usagers en fauteuil roulant.


== Correspondances ==
La gare est desservie par les lignes 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 407, 408, 414, 414D, 415, 416 et 453 du réseau de bus TICE, par les lignes 91.01, 91.04, 91.05 et 91.09 de la société de transport Albatrans, par les lignes 24.11 et 24.12 de la société de transport Keolis Seine Essonne, par les lignes 7001 et 7002 de la société de transport Cars Sœur, par la ligne 50 de l'établissement Transdev de Lieusaint et, la nuit, par les lignes N135 et N144 du réseau Noctilien.


== Projets ==
En 2017, cette gare devrait être desservie par la ligne 4 du T Zen. En 2018, elle devrait être le terminus sud-est du Tram Express Sud.

Omara se trouve dans le district de Waitaki dans l'ancienne province d'Otago. Le fleuve Ahuriri se trouve à courte distance du nord du village.
Omarama offre divers services aux paysans et autres habitants. En particulier, on trouve des magasins d'alimentation, un bureau de poste et des stations-service. Ces services sont en expansion à cause de l'augmentation de la population et du nombre de touristes. Le nombre d'auberges de jeunesse et de chambres d'hôtes s'est accru considérablement en raison de l'afflux de randonneurs. Ce village attire aussi les pêcheurs, artistes, astronomes, vélivoles, skieurs et autres.
Une proportion significative des habitants sont employés par la compagnie Meridian Energy Limited qui est une compagnie d'État assurant la fourniture d'électricité hydraulique.
Omarama est le nom Mâori signifiant « Endroit lumineux » à cause des ciels exceptionnellement clairs de la région.


== Vol à voile ==
À cause des excellentes conditions aérologiques et de la beauté du paysage, ce village héberge un centre de vol à voile de renommée mondiale. Il a hébergé en 1995 les championnats du monde de vol à voile organisés par la Fédération aéronautique internationale.
Les pilotes viennent à Omarama pour effectuer des vols d'onde, vols de pente ou tout simplement exploiter les thermiques de la région.
Dans de bonnes conditions, les pilotes peuvent effectuer des vols de plus de 1 000 km. Plusieurs records nationaux et mondiaux ont été battus et les conditions aérologiques locales ont attiré des chasseurs de records comme Steve Fosset.
Le club de vol à voile d'Omarama et d'autres structures commerciales sont basées à Omarama qui fournissent toute une palette de services aux pilotes locaux, aux pilotes visiteurs et au grand public comme de l'école, des baptêmes de l'air ou tout simplement des remorqués.

« L'an mille sept cent cinquante deux le vingt deuxième jour du mois d'Août... entre Jean Baptiste Noël avocat à la cour exerçant à Remiremont, fils d'honnête Joseph Noël, marchand bourgeois au dit lieu et d'Anne Marie Durand ses père et mère de cette paroisse d'une part et demoiselle Thérèse Sabine Jacquel, fille de défunt sieur Jean Robert Jacquel ancien receveur des domaines de la prévôté d'Arches et de Barbe Catherine Vanesson ses père et mère... »

En novembre 1750, il est reçu avocat en la Cour souveraine de Lorraine (parlement de Nancy). Le 12 octobre 1753, ses parents donnent l'ensemble de leurs biens à leur fils, qui vient d'être « nommé Procureur fiscal de la ville de Remiremont par la Dame Abbesse », charge qu'avait tenue son beau-père et à laquelle il renonce en septembre 1756 en faveur de son beau-frère François Delorme (1724-1808). Le 3 avril 1754, il est choisi comme Grand Chancelier de l'Insigne Chapitre Noble de Remiremont » avec le titre de « Seigneur de Bains »[réf. insuffisante],,[réf. insuffisante] par l'abbesse Christine de Saxe, tante du roi Louis XVI. Dans ces fonctions, il a à gérer les intérêts complexes du chapitre, notamment dans ses rapports avec le pouvoir ducal, et à en restaurer les finances, gravement compromises. « Cet emploi était un des plus honorables de cette province et peut-être celui qui attirait le plus de considération à raison des rapports multipliés qu'il nécessitait avec les seigneurs, le clergé, le chapitre... et même avec le Souverain dont les officiers tentaient sous cape à empiéter sur les droits du chapitre »[réf. insuffisante]. Il dirige tout ce qui concerne les biens, revenus, droits seigneuriaux et prérogatives tant ecclésiastiques que féodales du chapitre.
Noël est également conseiller-solliciteur puis conseiller intime de Madame l'Abbesse,,.
Élu député à l'Assemblée provinciale de Lorraine en 1788, il est nommé en 1789 procureur-syndic du district de Remiremont, poste qu'il conserve lors du renouvellement de 1791, puis, le 7 février 1790, officier municipal de Remiremont,.


== Député de la Convention ==
Le 2 septembre 1792, alors qu'il ne s'est pas présenté à l'élection, il est élu par l'assemblée électorale du département des Vosges, le cinquième sur huit, avec 210 voix sur 366 votants, député à la Convention nationale. Siégeant sur les bancs du Marais, il est nommé au Comité de législation, où il exerce les fonctions de président pendant deux mois, conformément au règlement de l'Assemblée[réf. insuffisante], avant de laisser la place à Cambacérès.
Durant les douze mois où il participe effectivement au travail de la Convention, il se fait remarquer par son œuvre de jurisconsulte, notamment par la rédaction des articles relatifs aux successions (le Projet de loi sur les successions par J.B. Noël, député du département des Vosges, membre du Comité de Législation, imprimé par ordre de la Convention Nationale, en juillet 1793), qui ont été repris dans le Code civil en 1804, et par différentes interventions, notamment son Discours sur la situation et la politique générale et sa Défense de Roland contre Danton. Sa Motion d'ordre contre les concussionnaires, son Projet de décret contre les provocateurs au meurtre et surtout sa Réaction contre la prépondérance de la Commune de Paris lui attirent de grandes inimitiés[réf. insuffisante].


== Le procès du roi ==
Lors du procès du roi, il se récuse, aux quatre questions posées. À la première question (« Louis Capet est-il coupable de conspiration contre la liberté publique et d'attentats contre la sûreté générale de l'État, oui ou non ? »), il commente ainsi sa décision :

« J'ai l'honneur d'observer que mon fils était grenadier dans un bataillon du département des Vosges ; il est mort sur la frontière en défendant la patrie ; ayant le cœur déchiré de douleur, je ne puis être juge de celui qu'on regarde comme le principal auteur de cette mort, la délicatesse me force à ne pas voter. »

Aux questions suivantes, il se borne à confirmer ses premiers propos, précisant à la deuxième question (« Le jugement de la Convention nationale contre Louis Capet sera-t-il soumis à la ratification du peuple, oui ou non ? ») :

« Je me récuse d'après les motifs que j'ai énoncés dans le premier appel nominal. »

Par ailleurs, il rédige un discours — Opinion de Jean-Baptiste Noël député du département des Vosges, sur le jugement de Louis XVI — développant son point de vue, imprimé à huit cents exemplaires :

« Citoyens,
Dois-je opiner dans ce grand procès, je ne le crois pas. Mon fils était grenadier dans un bataillon de mon département ; il était en garnison à Landau. Le traître, qui y commandait avant le brave Custine, envoya sa compagnie à 4 à 5 lieues en avant sur les terres de l'ennemi avec environ 30 chasseurs. À peine furent-ils arrivés au lieu indiqué que fatigués et n'ayant pas mangé depuis la veille, ils furent assaillis par quatre ou cinq cents uhlans : ils perdirent quelques hommes. Mon fils est du nombre. Au retour, il fut mis, de même que plusieurs de ses camarades, à l'hôpital où il mourut dix ou douze jours après, le 18 août dernier. Cette perte est d'autant plus cruelle pour moi, que ce fils était un jeune homme de la plus belle espérance ; la preuve en est qu’il s’était tellement acquis l’estime de ses camarades que, peu de jours avant sa mort, il avait été élu lieutenant-colonel de l’un de nos plus beaux bataillons, quoique âgé de vingt et un ans seulement.
Eh bien, Citoyens, ayant le cœur déchiré de douleur, puis-je être juge de l'homme que vous regardez comme le principal auteur de ces meurtres. Si la Convention trouve cette cause de récusation insuffisante et m'oblige à opiner, je le ferai avec toute l'impartialité que la plus austère probité exige de quiconque veut remplir cette terrible fonction. »

Donnant ensuite son avis juridique et politique, Noël estime, concernant le roi :

« Jusque-là il n'était que suspendu. Il doit donc être jugé aujourd'huy comme il eût pu et dû l'être alors. C'est donc comme roi et à raison des crimes qu'il a pu commettre étant Roi que vous allez le juger. Ses crimes sont la violation de ses serments et ses conspirations contre la Nation, conspirations qui ont causé le massacre de nombre de citoyens, l'incendie et le pillage, en un mot des maux affreux dont le terme ne nous est pas encore connu [...]. Il n'est pas le seul coupable, sans doute, mais s'il eut été franc et loyal, s'il eut sincèrement accepté et voulu la Constitution il les aurait empêchés ; il en avait tous les pouvoirs. Loin de là, il a donné les mains à tout; je l’en crois convaincu.
Je cherche dans le Code Pénal quelle peine peut être appliquée à un roi coupable de ces crimes et je ne l’y trouve pas. Je cherche dans la Constitution et ne trouve que la déchéance de la Royauté. Je demande aux principes et je me dis : en matière criminelle nulle peine arbitraire ne peut être prononcée ; le juge n'est que l'organe de la loi et ne peut appliquer que la peine prononcée par la Loi. Je ne puis donc prononcer que la déchéance [...]. La Royauté étant abolie, il serait dérisoire de prononcer la déchéance, j'en conviens et j'en conclus qu'il n'y a plus de peine à prononcer et que tout ce que l'on peut et doit faire, c'est prendre contre lui les mesures de sûreté générale que l’on croira le plus convenable au salut de la République. »

Suit une argumentation politique, dans laquelle il dénonce d’obscurs calculs et des intrigues :

« L’exécution du roi ne règle nullement le problème monarchique ; elle présente même les plus graves dangers. Louis est plus redoutable mort que vivant : haï de la Nation, pauvre et sans armée. Sa mort excitera d'abord les ennemis de la République. Ensuite ses héritiers : un fils innocent ou des frères plus hostiles que lui à la réforme du régime, d’autres encore ne manqueront pas de faire valoir un jour leurs prétentions et rétabliront l’ancien ordre de chose. »

Il attaque d'autres ambitions :

« Ces héritiers du pouvoir monarchique, ambitieux liberticides, ont des partisans nombreux au sein même de la Convention et au-dehors parmi ces ""orateurs de guinguette"" [...]. Ils seraient vraisemblablement les premiers à relever la tyrannie [...] Tout cela annonce des desseins perfides. »

Noël conclut :

« Le grand nombre du peuple a l’esprit républicain. »

« Une consultation populaire, une fois la paix rétablie ne devrait aboutir qu’à un consentement général à cet ordre à condition qu’on n’inquiète pas ce peuple dans cette liberté même qu’il vient d’acquérir, liberté religieuse, liberté économique, légalité. »

Pour mémoire, les cinq autres députés vosgiens et le suppléant présents au procès du roi ont voté ainsi : Poullain-Grandprey, Souhait et Perrin ont demandé la mort, Bresson, Couhey et Balland ont demandé l'exil ou l'internement.


== L'affaire Léonard Bourdon ==
Le 16 mars 1793, le représentant en mission Léonard Bourdon est blessé à Orléans lors d'une rixe opposant des membres de la « Société des amis de la Liberté et de l’Égalité » (désignation générique d'un club affilié aux Jacobins de Paris après le 10 août 1792, « sans préjudice d'appellation locale »), qui accompagnent les commissaires de la Convention, et des hommes en armes — factionnaires de la garde ou citoyens volontaires, selon les versions. Avertie de l'événement, présenté comme une rébellion de la municipalité d'Orléans, la Convention prend un décret déclarant la ville en rébellion, instaurant l'état de siège, suspendant la municipalité, ordonnant l'arrestation du maire et du procureur de la commune et chargeant trois commissaires d'enquêter sur l'affaire. Chargé le 13 mai par la Convention, au nom des comités de législation et de sûreté générale, d'un rapport sur le conflit opposant les représentants en mission à la municipalité, le Rapport sur la pétition des maires, officiers municipaux et procureur de la commune d'Orléans, Noël monte le jeudi 30 mai 1793 à la tribune pour proposer un projet de décret blanchissant la municipalité et la rétablissant dans ses fonctions, mais Bourdon s'y oppose, et la Convention vote l'ajournement de la lecture du rapport jusqu'à la séance de mardi,. Selon Étienne Noël, Bourdon, l'occasion se présentant, fait ajouter le nom de Jean-Baptiste Noël à celui des 29 députés et deux ministres girondins placés en résidence surveillée à l'issue de la séance du 2 juin.


== La fuite et l'arrestation ==
Proscrit, Noël se cache à Paris jusqu'au[réf. nécessaire] rapport d'Amar du 3 octobre, qui aboutit au vote d'un décret renvoyant plusieurs chefs girondins devant le Tribunal révolutionnaire, auquel il est mêlé, et ordonnant l'arrestation des protestataires des 6 et 19 juin. Le lendemain, le Tribunal révolutionnaire rend un jugement de prise de corps à son encontre. Toutefois, le même jour, il s'enfuit de Paris et, le 8, l'huissier chargé de lui notifier son arrestation annonce ne l'avoir trouvé dans aucun de ses logements successifs.
Arrêté au Russey (Doubs) le 2 frimaire an II (22 novembre 1793) alors qu'il s'apprête à rejoindre la Suisse, Noël présente un faux passeport, obtenu par complaisance au nom de Jean-Baptiste Morel, cultivateur et officier municipal au Tillot (district de Remiremont), mais il est emmené à Saint-Hippolyte où il avoue sa véritable identité,.
Son collègue, le girondin Dulaure, indique dans ses Mémoires :

« Ce fut alors que j'appris la nouvelle de l'arrestation d'un de mes collègues, nommé Noël. Ce vieillard respectable, décrété d'accusation, était déjà parvenu à l'extrême frontière du côté de Montbéliard, et n'avait plus qu'une heure de chemin pour arriver en Suisse. »

Le 5 frimaire (25 novembre), Bernard de Saintes, envoyé en mission dans le Jura, annonce depuis Montbéliard son arrestation au président de la convention : « On m'avait demandé à Saint-Hippolyte une voiture pour le conduire ici ; je l'ai refusée parce que je n'ai pas cru qu'un traître, qui avait trouvé des jambes pour désobéir à la loi, dût en manquer pour s'y soumettre ; il est donc venu à pied ; il couchera ce soir sur la dure et soupera frugalement en prison ; demain il partira pour Paris à cheval pour y être plus tôt rendu ; je remettrai à la gendarmerie ses papiers, qui prouvent qu'il s'est donné un nom supposé, qu'il a surpris un faux passeport et travaillé à se frayer le chemin de la Suisse,. »
Toujours à la même date, il envoie Noël au Tribunal révolutionnaire avec une lettre à Fouquier-Tinville indiquant : « Je t'envoie, citoyen, les papiers trouvés sur le député Noël, décrété d'accusation, et les procès-verbaux de sa capture et interrogatoire. Je le fais conduire dans les prisons de Paris. Je n'ai pas besoin de te le recommander. Tu as trop bien travaillé ses camarades et tu aimes trop l'égalité pour ne pas lui donner les mêmes soins. Et voilà encore un ennemi de moins. »


== L'interrogatoire ==
Extrait de la conciergerie et interrogé par Armand Verteuil le 18 frimaire an II en présence de Fouquier Tinville, Noël est d'abord questionné sur les motifs de sa fuite.

« Le Tribunal Révolutionnaire ayant condamné à la peine de mort tous les députés qui avaient été traduits devant lui sans aucune exception, je me décidai de rechercher une retraite dans les monts Jura...
Observé au prévenu que ces excuses n'ont jamais dispensé un Représentant du Peuple de donner l'exemple de l'obéissance due aux lois et qu'il devait obéir sur le champ au décret d'accusation.
A répondu que tout citoyen peut se laisser juger par contumace, sans qu'on puisse lui en faire un crime et qu'il serait inouï qu'un député fut traité plus rigoureusement à cet égard que tout autre citoyen, la loi étant la même pour tous. »

Noël refuse ensuite d'indiquer les noms des personnes qui ont bien voulu lui donner retraite « de crainte de compromettre ceux qui (lui) ont rendu ce service ».
À la question « Quelle route avez-vous suivi de Paris à l'endroit de votre arrestation? », il assure :

« De Paris à Belfort, en droiture et de là également en droiture jusqu'au lieu de mon arrestation. »

Il refuse ensuite de nommer le particulier qui lui a remis un « passeport supposé ».

« Comme Représentant du Peuple vous ne pouviez ignorer la loi qui défend semblable contrefaçon ainsi que les peines qui y sont portées.
Répond qu'il ne connait pas de loi qui prononce des peines à cet égard ; que d'ailleurs il était impossible de s'évader sans se procurer des moyens d'évasion ; qu'on ne peut pas faire un grief à un décrété d'accusation d'user des moyens qui peuvent lui procurer une retraite... »

S'ensuit un échange sur les « assemblées particulières » auxquelles Noël auraient pu assister chez Valazé — Noël nie avoir participé à de telles réunions — ; sur ce qu'il aurait tramé contre la « Souveraineté et l'Indivisibilité de la République » — fidèle à ses convictions Noël confirme qu'il a toujours dit que la « France ne pouvait se sauver contre tant d'ennemis qu'en restant parfaitement unie ».
Le Conseil de la commune de Remiremont avait depuis longtemps témoigné à décharge :

« Le citoyen Noël, député des Vosges n'a jamais durant la session de la Convention rien adressé au Conseil en vue de soulever soit contre la commune de Paris soit contre l'unité de la République, ni rien qui puisse porter atteinte à la liberté et à la sureté du peuple français. »

Cette attestation de civisme n'est pas présentée à l'audience.


== La condamnation et l'exécution ==
Le tribunal condamne le prévenu le 18 frimaire an II à la peine de mort pour avoir conspiré contre « l'unité et l’indivisibilité de la République, contre la liberté et la sûreté du peuple français » et déclare ses biens acquis à la République, ordonnant l'exécution dans les 24 heures, place de la Révolution. Le jugement est signé du président Claude-Emmanuel Dobsen, des juges David et Armand Verteuil et du greffier Filleul[réf. insuffisante].
En 1862, dans le livre Mémoire des Sanson, sept générations d'excécuteurs écrit par le fils du bourreau Henri-Clément Sanson d'après les carnets de son père Henri Sanson se trouve le passage suivant:

« 18 frimaire. Ce jour nous avons guillotiné Jean-Baptiste Noël, député des Vosges, hors la loi. Dans la route, il m'a demandé si c'était vrai que madame Dubarry avait eu si grand peur ; et, une autre fois, si on avait bien essuyé le couteau, parce qu'il ne convenait pas que le sang d'un républicain fût souillé par le sang d'une prostituée. »

Quelques années plus tard, en 1883, évoquant la mort de la favorite de Louis XV, Charles Vatel raconte: « Pendant que les anciens banquiers s'efforcent de rassurer Madame du Barry, Noël, le conventionnel, philosophe doucement sur la vanité des choses humaines, l'impossibilité de vivre sous un régime de terreur et le bonheur de quitter le monde. »
En 1946, Henri Gaubert écrit qu'il est conduit à l'échafaud dans la même charrette que Madame du Barry et qu'il tente vainement de haranguer la foule. Ses paroles furent couvertes par de retentissants « Vive la République ».
Son corps et celui de ses compagnons de supplice sont jetés au cimetière de la Madeleine. C'est là que s'élève aujourd'hui, rue Pasquier, dans le square Louis-XVI, la chapelle expiatoire.

813,"Beech Bend Park est un parc d'attractions, camping et circuit de courses automobiles situé dans le Comté de Warren, dans le Kentucky, aux États-Unis, non loin de la ville de Bowling Green.
À l'origine, la zone qu'occupe aujourd'hui le parc était composée de parcs et d'aires de pique-nique. Charles Garvin acheta le terrain au début des années 1940 et y installa d'années en années des attractions. La première d'entre elles fut un pony ride, suivit d'une piste de patins à roulettes, un hall de danse, un bowling et une piscine.
Peu après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, Garvin commença à ajouter des attractions mécaniques comme la grande roue rachetée à l'Exposition universelle de 1933 (Century of Progress) de Chicago. Les courses de moto commencèrent à la même époque.
Dans les années 1970, le parc était en déclin, largement à cause de la compétition avec des parcs comme Opryland USA. À la mort de Garvin, en 1979, le parc fut fermé, bien que les courses aient continuées. Le parc fut racheté par un groupe d'investisseurs, dont le chanteur de musique country Ronnie Milsap qui dirigea le parc sans succès de 1981 à 1982. Le parc ferma une seconde fois.
En 1984, Dallas et Alfreda Jones rachetèrent la piste de course et commencèrent à organiser des courses de dragsters sous l'aile de la National Hot Rod Association. Trois ans plus tard, le couple acheta le reste du parc et rénova le camping. La piscine fut rouverte et d'autres attractions furent ajoutées.
En 2006, le parc a installé ses quatrièmes montagnes russes, le Kentucky Rumbler.

818,"Philippe-Sirice Bridel (également appelé Philippe Cyriaque ou le Doyen Bridel), né le 20 novembre 1757 à Begnins dans le bailliage bernois de Nyon et mort le 20 mai 1845 à Montreux, dans le canton de Vaud, est un écrivain et poète suisse, qui a contribué au développement de l'identité nationale de son pays.


== Biographie ==
Bridel exerce la profession de pasteur protestant dans les villes de Bâle, Château-d'Œx et Montreux. Il se tourne ensuite vers la littérature, et commence à écrire des poèmes à partir de 1782 ; il est à ce titre considéré comme le premier poète vaudois. L'invasion de la République helvétique par les troupes françaises en 1798, et les impôts établis par le commissaire des guerres Rapinat sur les grandes villes suisses, lui inspire ce quatrain:

Il devient célèbre pour son travail sur l'histoire et la langue suisses, en particulier pour son Glossaire du patois de la Suisse romande, publié à titre posthume en 1866.

819,"La Législature du Nebraska (Nebraska Legislature) constitue le pouvoir législatif dans l'État américain du Nebraska. Cette législature a la particularité d'être le plus petit Parlement du pays, le seul Parlement unicaméral du pays et le seul où les élus ne sont pas répartis dans la salle par affiliation politique.
Le Parlement du Nebraska siège au Capitole situé à Lincoln.


== Historique ==
À l'origine, le Nebraska avait adopté le système bicaméral.
S'inspirant du parlement de Queensland en Australie, le sénateur George Norris fit campagne en 1931 pour réformer le pouvoir législatif du Nebraska et adopter un système unicaméral, estimant que le bicaméralisme était inefficace et un vestige du parlementarisme britannique. En 1934, un amendement constitutionnel fut adopté, supprimant la chambre des représentants et conférant ses pouvoirs au Sénat.
Le nouveau parlement siégea pour la première fois en 1937. Les élus de la législature gardèrent néanmoins le titre de sénateur.


== Composition ==

La Législature du Nebraska comprend 49 sénateurs, élus pour 4 ans et dont les sièges sont renouvelables par moitié tous les deux ans. Chaque sénateur représente un district général de 35 000 électeurs.
Le Nebraska a abandonné le système des élections primaires et organise une élection générale à deux tours permettant aux deux candidats arrivés en tête au premier tour de se présenter au second tour. L'élection est non partisane, c'est-à-dire que les partis n'interviennent pas dans le choix des candidats et que ceux-ci n'ont pas à faire valoir obligatoirement leur appartenance politique.
Les sénateurs n'ont pas à s'organiser ensuite en fonction de groupes politiques et des coalitions ad hoc sont le plus souvent formées sur des bases géographiques, philosophiques ou autres. Dans les faits, les sénateurs du Nebraska ont tous une affiliation politique et les partis politiques ne manquent jamais de soutenir des candidats lors des élections bien que celles-ci soient non partisanes.
En conséquence, la répartition non officielle des sénateurs accorde, en 2008, une nette domination de la représentation politique aux Républicains (31 républicains, 15 démocrates et 3 indépendants).
Les sessions de la législature durent de 60 à 90 jours. Elle est présidée par un Speaker en l'absence du lieutenant-gouverneur. L'administration de législature est organisée par le Speaker, un directeur, un vice-directeur et 6 sénateurs.
La législature vote les lois et peut outrepasser un veto du gouverneur par la majorité des deux tiers des voix.

822,"Crysis est un jeu vidéo de tir à la première personne futuriste développé par Crytek Studios et édité par Electronic Arts le 16 novembre 2007 sur Windows.
Le 31 janvier 2008, lors d'une conférence avec ses actionnaires, Electronic Arts a annoncé que Crysis s'était vendu à plus d'un million d'exemplaires dans le monde.
Le jeu peut être considéré comme une suite spirituelle de Far Cry. En effet, bien que leurs histoires ne soient pas reliées, les deux opus sont des jeux de tir à la première personne se déroulant sur une île du Pacifique et mêlant réalisme et science-fiction. Crysis utilise l'évolution du moteur CryENGINE utilisé pour Far Cry, le CryENGINE2.
Un stand-alone, baptisé Crysis Warhead, est sorti en 2008. Il permet au joueur de revivre les évènements de Crysis en incarnant le lieutenant Michael Sykes (alias Psycho), l'un des coéquipiers de Nomad, le héros du premier opus. Une suite est sortie en 2011. Les événements suivent l'histoire de l'épisode 1 avec le personnage Prophète (un coéquipier de Nomad)


== Scénario ==
En 2020, la Corée du Nord prend possession de l'archipel Lingshan Islands, îles fictives situées quelque part en mer de Chine méridionale et en interdit l'accès. Un groupe d'archéologues américains présents sur place, mené par le Dr. Rosenthal, envoie un message de détresse indiquant qu'ils ont découvert là-bas quelque chose qui pourrait changer le monde. Afin d'enquêter sur place et évacuer les civils, les États-Unis décident d'envoyer une unité d’élite des forces spéciales, l'équipe Raptor dont fait partie Nomad, le personnage que l'on va incarner.
Au cours de leur parachutage, un problème de parachute survient et les membres de l'équipe se retrouvent séparés sur l'île. Tandis qu'ils affrontent les forces de l'APC chacun de leurs côtés, l'un d'entre eux est tué par une force inconnue avant qu'ils aient pu tous se regrouper et le reste de l'équipe découvre le bateau des otages complètement gelé en plein milieu de l'île tropicale. De plus, il apparait vite que l'APC est aux prises avec un ennemi inconnu.
Acte 1 : Une équipe d'archéologues découvre, en faisant des fouilles, une sorte de temple vieux de plusieurs millions d'années. Les forces militaires nord-coréennes assiègent l'île et évacuent la population. En tant que membre de l'équipe Raptor, Nomad est amené à effectuer une chute opérationnelle sur l'île afin de secourir les otages, des ressortissants américains, et en parallèle dresser un rapport au gouvernement sur le test d'une nouvelle combinaison de combat nanotechnologique portée par toute l'équipe Raptor. Durant cette phase du jeu, le joueur se retrouve dans un environnement exotique, et doit progresser d'objectif en objectif en contournant ou en affrontant les patrouilles et les bases nord-coréennes. Durant l'aventure, de mystérieux phénomènes apparaissent et plusieurs membres de l'équipe sont tués par un Scout Ceph. Au bout d'un moment, la présence américaine est confirmée par les nord-coréens, et l'urgence force les troupes américaines à débarquer sur l'île pour appuyer Nomad, faisant passer la mission d'une infiltration à une escarmouche ouverte. Le joueur passe alors par des phases en tank, doit assister les opérations au sol en démolissant des sites stratégiques en œuvrant en tant que commando grâce à ses capacités surhumaines... Finalement, le joueur retrouve les otages et le chef militaire nord-coréen. Ce que les archéologues croyaient être un temple millénaire issu d'une ancienne civilisation se révèle être un vaisseau Ceph enfoui depuis des millions d'années sous terre, réactivé par les fouilles nord-coréennes.
Acte 2 : Après avoir évacué la seule survivante de l'équipe archéologique, Nomad est pris au piège dans l'éboulement d'une mine. Il pénètre alors dans les entrailles du vaisseau mère pour tenter de trouver une issue. Lorsque le joueur entre dans le vaisseau mère, il combat des Cephs dans un environnement dénué de gravité. Le joueur découvre alors que les Scouts qu'il a pu apercevoir n'est qu'une machine contenant un Ceph, et que les véritables entités Ceph sont des êtres translucides qui demeurent tapis dans leur vaisseau. Il doit les combattre dans un level design complexe car sans gravité et autant vertical qu'horizontal. Enfin, le joueur trouve une sortie qui débouche à flanc de montagne.
Acte 3 : A sa sortie à l'air libre, Nomad s'aperçoit que tout a gelé sur l'île. Ses supérieurs l'informent que le vaisseau mère a créé une bulle d'énergie autour de l'île, et qu'ils n'ont aucun moyen de savoir ce qui se passe. Nomad se rend compte que toute ce qui est dans la bulle a été congelé à des températures extrêmes, tuant tout être humain normalement constitué. Nomad a pu survivre uniquement grâce à sa nano-combinaison. Il remarque également que son intrusion dans le vaisseau a réveillé la colère des Cephs, qui se lancent à l'assaut de l'île par le biais de leurs machines et vaisseaux. Nomad doit alors fuir l'île pour rejoindre la côte. Les nord-coréens et les américains s'enfuient lorsqu'ils viennent à réaliser que le temple est en fin de compte un vaisseau Ceph. Au début de cet acte, le joueur retrouve soudainement son chef d'unité, Prophet, qu'il croyait mort. Ce dernier a survécu et a su adapter une arme Ceph à l'énergie de sa nano-combinaison pour la faire fonctionner. Après de rudes combats, Nomad, Prophet et les marines restés en dehors de la sphère d'énergie parviennent à quitter l'île en compagnie d'Helena Rosenthal, seule scientifique survivante. Regagnant la flotte américaine qui entoure l'île, ils font leur débriefing. Les scientifiques s'aperçoivent que le vaisseau émet une transmission jusqu'à une galaxie lointaine (la galaxie M33). Les militaires craignent une invasion, mais Helena suggère un appel de détresse de ""naufragés spatiaux"" écrasés sur Terre il y a des millions d'années. Un conflit éclate sur la manière de régler cette histoire, mais la hiérarchie militaire l'emporte et un missile nucléaire est tiré par un avion sur l'île sous l'aval du gouvernement américain. Prophet de son côté s'empare d'armes et d'un ADAV et retourne sur l'île ""pour en finir"". L'explosion nucléaire échoue, puisqu'elle renforce les Cephs (l'énergie et la puissance de choc est la principale source d'énergie des Cephs), qui fondent sur les navires et les attaquent. La dernière séquence du jeu oblige le joueur à aider à l'évacuation de son porte-avions pris d'assaut par les Cephs, avant d'affronter sur le pont deux boss finaux, un Hunter et en fin, un Warrior. Durant l'épilogue, on apprend que Prophet est toujours vivant et a contacté les survivants par radio : il est toujours sur l'île. Nomad décide d'aller le chercher.


== Système de jeu ==
Crysis est un jeu de tir à la première personne qui se déroule dans un décor comprenant : jungle, jungle gelée, mines à ciel ouvert et souterraine, plages, village autochtones, montagnes, vallées etc.
Crysis offre au joueur une expérience dans laquelle il doit adapter stratégies, armement, défenses et styles de jeu pour survivre et venir à bout de l'invasion extraterrestre. Le joueur dispose pour cela d'un équipement de nouvelle génération comprenant une nano-combinaison utilisant la nanotechnologie disposant de quatre modes de fonctionnement qui sont :
Le mode armure : la résistance aux balles et aux chocs est améliorée. Chaque choc consomme de l'énergie. Ce mode augmente de 1.5 X la santé du joueur.
Le mode force : la puissance musculaire est grandement améliorée, les coups de poings et de crosse sont plus puissants, et permettent de tuer en un ou deux coups les ennemis humains, la hauteur de saut est quadruplée et il est possible de projeter des objets et les ennemis plus loin, ce qui les tue instantanément - contrairement aux autres modes ou l'on doit les lancer d'un surplomb ou les maintenir (pour les étrangler) avant de lancer. Lorsque les munitions se feront rares, le joueur disposera toujours de la possibilité de lancer divers objets sur les ennemis tels que des caisses (en bois ou en métal), des bidons d'essence explosifs ou même d'autres ennemis. Le mode force permet également de concentrer et de stabiliser sa visée, notamment lors de tirs au fusil de sniper, ce qui en améliore grandement la précision. Certaines armes lourdes nécessitent également fortement l'emploi du mode force, afin de contenir leur recul important et pouvoir se déplacer vite malgré leur poids (La grosse mitrailleuse Gatling par exemple). En ""force maximum"", la distance des tirs à la grenade est fortement améliorée.
Le mode vitesse : la vitesse de sprint est presque multipliée par trois (cependant cela est modifiable via une ligne de code), cependant la barre d'énergie diminue extrêmement rapidement lors du sprint. Associé aux poings de Nomad, ce dernier peut effectuer des charges fulgurantes suivies d'un coup qui est le plus souvent fatal.
Le mode camouflage : la combinaison utilise de petit cristaux de diamant courbant la lumière en produisant une indice de réfraction négatif sur la combinaison, donnant au joueur une forme d'invisibilité. Ce mode est utile pour les modes facile, normal et difficile, mais il est très peu efficace en difficulté delta, surtout la nuit. Également associé à la force des poings, le joueur peut s'improviser assassin en frappant l'ennemi par derrière. Cependant, tout tir ou lancement d'objet épuise instantanément l'énergie de la nano-combinaison et fait repasser le joueur en mode armure. Il est à noter que le pointeur laser de certaines armes, lorsqu'il est activé, alerte parfois les ennemis de votre présence et leur dévoile rapidement votre position.
Le mode de modification des armes : ce menu permet de modifier des armes en temps réel pour ajouter ou enlever à la guise du joueur un silencieux, une lunette parmi les trois disponibles (reflex, assaut, sniper), des munitions incendiaires, un laser, une lampe torche, et bien d'autres accessoires.
Tous les paramètres sont modifiables depuis un fichier texte.
Le jeu offre une expérience non-linéaire où la liberté d'action est primordiale. Pour cela, le joueur possède l'armure et les armes personnalisables, de plus aucun parcours à travers les niveaux n'est prédéfini. Mais le joueur doit cependant accomplir des objectifs fixes. D'ailleurs la progression se déroule en trois actes.


== Personnages ==
Nomad : c'est le personnage que le joueur incarne tout au long du jeu. Son visage n'est jamais montré.
Psycho : c'est un autre membre de l'équipe d'intervention spéciale. Il aide Nomad jusqu'à la fin du jeu. Il est le personnage que le joueur incarne dans Crysis Warhead.
Prophet : c'est le chef de l'équipe, il est attaqué et attrapé par les Cephs mais Prophet réussie à s'enfuir. Nomad le retrouve à sa sortie du vaisseau. C'est lui qui découvre la nouvelle arme Ceph. Pendant la dernière mission, il retourne dans la sphère d'énergie Ceph protégeant l'île ; tout le monde le pense mort mais dans la dernière cinématique on entend qu'il est toujours en vie et que Nomad part le secourir.
Jester : un autre membre de l'équipe ; il se fait tuer assez rapidement par les Cephs lorsqu'ils découvrent le bateau des chercheurs.
Aztec : un membre de l'équipe, qui n'apparaît qu'une seule fois et meurt éventré par un Scout Ceph.
Docteur Rosenthal : il est le chef de l'équipe d'archéologue qui découvre les Cephs. Il a une fille, Héléna, qui travaille parmi les membres de l'équipe. Il est capturé par l'armée nord-Coréenne et réalise des expériences pour elle. Lorsque Nomad le retrouve, il parle de ses recherches avec le chef militaire coréen, le général Kyong. Nomad tente de s'échapper avec lui, mais le fossile Ceph qu'il était en train d'étudier explose, le transformant en statue de glace et de givre. Il meurt sur le coup.
Héléna Rosenthal : son père est le chef des scientifiques. Elle est prise en otage par l'armée nord-coréenne. Elle quitte l'île avec les forces spéciale américaines venues la libérer une fois les Cephs réveillés.
Général Ri-Chan Kyong : officier nord-coréen qui dirige les troupes de l'APC sur l'île. Il est l'antagoniste principal pendant une partie du jeu. Il retient en otage les scientifiques américains dans la montagne de l'île, en réalité un vaisseau mère Ceph. Il a la particularité de porter une nano-combinaison, comme certains de ses hommes. Il est tué par Nomad comme un boss vers la fin du jeu.
Major Strickland : officier américain qui mène l'opération de l'équipe à nano-combi. Il donne leurs objectifs de mission. Il apparaît vers la fin du jeu, où il se fait écraser par un Hunter Ceph en voulant couvrir la fuite de ses troupes hors de l'île.


== Développement ==


=== Moteur du jeu ===
Crysis utilise Direct3D, l'API de Microsoft pour le rendu graphique, et inclut le même éditeur que Crytek a utilisé pour concevoir le jeu. Le jeu s'exécute sur le nouveau moteur, le CryEngine 2, qui est le successeur de la première version du moteur utilisé pour le jeu Far Cry. CryEngine 2 a été parmi les premiers moteurs à utiliser Direct3D 10 de Windows Vista, mais qui a été conçu pour fonctionner avec DirectX 9 sur Windows Vista et Windows XP.
Roy Taylor, Vice-Président des relations publiques chez Nvidia, a parlé sur le thème de la complexité du moteur, indiquant que Crysis a plus d'un million de lignes de code, de 1 Go de données de texture, 85.000 shaders et près de trois mille pages de code.
Juste après la sortie du jeu, en 2008, Crysis est souvent utilisé comme référence dans les tests informatiques, à la suite de ses demandes en ressources et ses réglages lors de sa sortie. Lors de sa sortie, le jeu était tellement exigent en configuration matériel que le slogan ""Oui, mais peut-il exécuter Crysis ?"" a été souvent utilisé lors des critiques sur les tests de carte graphique.


=== Sortie d'une démo ===
Le 27 août 2007, Crytek annonce la sortie d'une démo solo pour le 25 septembre, toutefois, la date a été repoussée au 26 octobre. La démo présente le premier niveau en totalité, Contact, ainsi que l'éditeur bac à sable,. Le 26 octobre, Crytek a annoncé que la démo serait repoussée, d'au moins, une journée. La démo sera rendue disponible le 27 octobre. Cependant, sur de nombreux sites, il a été prévu un jour plus tôt, et un oubli a permis aux publics d'obtenir le fichier directement sur le serveur d'EA plutôt que prévu.
Peu de temps après la sortie de la démo, certains amateurs ont constaté que, en manipulant les fichiers de configuration, la plupart des paramètres graphiques ""Très élevée"" (normalement réservés aux détenteurs de DirectX 10), pouvaient être activés sous DirectX 9. Le mode sous DirectX 9 est quasiment identique au mode DirectX 10, avec certaines caractéristiques graphiques qui ne peuvent être reproduites sous DirectX 9, comme le flou cinétique.


=== Versions console ===
En juillet 2011, il a été révélé que l'organisme coréen de classification de jeux ont évalué Crysis pour une les consoles Xbox 360 et PlayStation 3.
Le 8 septembre 2011, une bande-annonce comprenant des phases de gameplay du jeu a été publiée sur la page Twitter de Crytek. Il est montré de nouvelles fonctionnalités pour les consoles, de nouveaux éclairages, de nouveaux effets spéciaux et de nouveaux contrôles pour la Nanosuit avec des combats de précision et un support de la 3D stéréoscopique. La version pour console serait uniquement proposée en téléchargement. À la suite de cette annonce, Cevat Yerli, PDG de Crytek, a déclaré : «  Nous sommes extrêmement fiers de ce que nous avons pu accomplir avec Crysis. Nous avons décidé de créer une nouvelle génération de FPS et de livrer une expérience sur PC qui est devenu une référence pour la qualité technique et qu'il l'est encore pour beaucoup de joueurs, même quatre ans plus tard. En portant la campagne solo sur console, nous croyons que nous sommes à nouveau sur une norme de qualité dans le domaine du jeu téléchargeable. Cependant, contrairement à la version originale, les versions Xbox 360 et PlayStation 3 ne contiennent pas de multijoueurs ainsi que les extensions Warhead et Wars. ».
La version console a été rendue disponible le 4 octobre 2011.

La bande son du jeu a été composé par Inon Zur et est sortie le 27 novembre 2007.

=== Critiques ===
Le jeu a été unanimement acclamé pour ses graphismes parfois proches du photoréalisme. Parmi les points négatifs, Game One cite une intelligence artificielle parfois « accablante », un moteur graphique pas totalement optimisé, quelques erreurs d'affichage et un doublage des personnages nord-coréens « horripilant ».


=== Ventes ===
Début 2008, Electronic Arts annonce que Crysis s'est écoulé à un million d'exemplaires depuis son lancement le 16 novembre 2007, chiffre en soi décevant compte tenu de la considérable médiatisation du titre.


=== Récompenses ===

== Configuration ==

Les graphismes sont produits par le moteur graphique CryENGINE2. Le jeu utilise DirectX 10 dans son mode Very High qui nécessite une configuration haut de gamme à la sortie du titre. Les machines sous XP n'ont pas accès au dernier niveau de détails car ce système d'exploitation n'est pas compatible avec DirectX10. La puissance du jeu donne un nouvel aperçu du Cinematic Computing. Ce jeu est considéré comme le plus beau de sa génération : sur le plan de la qualité et de la finition, il peut encore rivaliser avec certains autres FPS, à près de 6 ans d'écart.
Crysis est devenu une référence en matière d'exigence informatique dans son utilisation vidéoludique du fait du matériel recommandé pour pouvoir le faire fonctionner en qualité maximale sans problèmes, à tel point que les développeurs se sont efforcés d'améliorer l'accessibilité du jeu suivant.

824,"Dans l'exégèse des textes (sacrés ou non), une péricope désigne un extrait formant une unité ou une pensée cohérente. La péricope doit avoir un sens, lue indépendamment de son contexte. Le terme provient du grec περικοπή signifiant « découpage ». Les principaux usages de ce mot concernent la liturgie, en général dans le cadre d'une lecture publique, et l'étude et le commentaire d'un texte.
Les lectionnaires, contenant les lectures bibliques sur un cycle donné (par ex. tous les dimanches de l'année), ne sont rien d'autre que des recueils de péricopes.
Un ensemble de péricopes placées à la suite les unes des autres de façon que leur ensemble ait un sens s'appelle une chaîne (littéraire), ou plus savamment une concaténation (de péricopes).

== Biographie ==
Diplômé d'ESCP Europe (1988), de l'Institut Multimédias (1992) et de Harvard Business School (2000), Arnaud de Puyfontaine commence sa carrière au Figaro où sa mission va consister à développer les liens du journal avec les Grandes écoles. Il y travaillera trois années tout en continuant ses études. Après un passage comme consultant chez Arthur Andersen, il se rend en Indonésie effectuer son service national. Il retourne au journal Le Figaro en tant qu'éditeur du quotidien et de ses suppléments, sous la houlette de Philippe Villin avec qui il travaille étroitement.
En 1995, il rejoint le groupe Emap. Il dirige d'abord Télé Poche et Studio Magazine. Il gère l'acquisition de Télé Star et de Télé Star jeux. Il crée le pôle Emap Star dont il devient directeur délégué avant d'être nommé en juillet 1998 directeur général du groupe Emap France après le départ de Kevin Hand à Londres à la maison mère. La création du pôle Star, devenu très vite un poids lourd de la presse télé, lui ouvre la présidence du groupe avec, en 1999, sa nomination au poste de président-directeur général. Il est également membre du management board d'Emap plc, d'Emap Digital Worldwide (1999-2006) et administrateur d'Emap Metro en Grande-Bretagne. Parallèlement Arnaud de Puyfontaine devient administrateur (1998) et Président (2004-2007) d'Audipresse et de l'Association pour la promotion de la presse magazine (APPM). Il devient également administrateur du Syndicat de la presse magazine et d'information (1998).
En 2006, Emap plc décide de céder sa filiale française. Au terme d'un processus de cession mené par Arnaud de Puyfontaine, Emap France rejoint le giron du groupe Mondadori. À travers cette acquisition, le groupe de media italien s'ouvre le marché français de la presse magazine. Confirmé dans ses fonctions, Arnaud de Puyfontaine est nommé en avril 2007 président de la holding Mondadori France qui, parallèlement à l'activité magazine, a vocation à accueillir de nouvelles activités. Dans cette optique, Arnaud de Puyfontaine est également nommé directeur général des activités numériques pour l'ensemble du groupe Mondadori. Il démissionne de ses mandats en août 2008 et devient « senior advisor » auprès de Maurizio Costa, vice-président et administrateur délégué du groupe Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. En octobre 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy lance les « États généraux de la presse écrite » et nomme Arnaud de Puyfontaine en qualité de président du pôle « Imprimer, transporter, distribuer, financer : comment régénérer le processus industriel de la presse écrite ? ». Au terme du processus, Arnaud de Puyfontaine se voit confier par le Président de la République une mission de suivi et d'implantation des recommandations adoptées qui ont inspiré en grande partie les récentes mutations du secteur.
Le 15 mai 2009, il est nommé CEO (chief executive officer) de Hearst UK, la filiale britannique de Hearst Corporation et devient « Monsieur Europe » pour l'un des tous premiers groupes media américains. En 2011 il prend la tête des opérations pour l'acquisition des quelque cent titres publiés par Lagardère dans une quinzaine de pays hors de France. Dans la foulée, il est nommé, en juin 2011, Vice-président exécutif de Hearst Magazine International.
En mai 2012, Arnaud de Puyfontaine rejoint le Conseil d’Administration de Schibsted, principal groupe de Media scandinave.
En janvier 2014, Arnaud de Puyfontaine rejoint le groupe Vivendi en tant que directeur général des activités médias et contenus. Le 24 juin 2014, il est nommé président du directoire de Vivendi. Le 27 avril 2016, il rejoint le Conseil d'Administration de Telecom Italia en qualité de Vice-président. Depuis le 1 juin 2017, il est Président Exécutif de Telecom Italia, en complément de ses fonctions chez Vivendi.
Arnaud de Puyfontaine est membre du Siècle et précédemment Président de ESCP Europe Alumni.
Arnaud de Puyfontaine est chevalier de l'Ordre de la Légion d'Honneur, de l'Ordre National du Mérite et de l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres. Il a également reçu les insignes de OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire).
Son grand-père maternel, André-Marie Gerard, fut rédacteur en chef de L'Aurore de 1957 à 1960. Il prit ensuite la direction des journaux télévisés de la RTF avant de devenir inspecteur général de l'ORTF.

833,"La Ferme du Caillou est la ferme dans laquelle fut établi le dernier Quartier Général de Napoléon la veille de la bataille de Waterloo.
Elle abrite un musée provincial connu sous le nom de Musée du Caillou qui constitue le seul musée napoléonien de Belgique,.
Ce musée abrite des pièces uniques, comme le lit de camp de l'Empereur ou la table utilisée à l'époque.
Il est géré par la Province du Brabant wallon, qui gère également sur le site de la bataille des monuments comme la colonne Victor Hugo et l'Aigle blessé.


== Localisation ==
La Ferme du Caillou se situe au hameau du Caillou à Vieux-Genappe, section de la commune belge de Genappe dans la province du Brabant wallon.
Elle se trouve à 4 km au sud du Lion de Waterloo, au numéro 66 de la chaussée de Bruxelles qui relie Genappe à Braine-l'Alleud et Waterloo.


== Historique ==

La ferme du Caillou est, à l'origine, une exploitation rurale construite en 1757.
Après sa victoire contre les Prussiens lors de la bataille de Ligny le 16 juin 1815, Napoléon Ier installa son dernier Quartier Général à la ferme du Caillou le 17 juin. Il y passa la nuit et y établit ses plans de bataille pour la bataille de Waterloo le matin du 18 juin 1815. La ferme fut ravagée par un incendie le matin du 18 juin 1815, les Prussiens ayant mis le feu dans une grange qui y attenait.
Le propriétaire de 1815, le fermier Boucquéau, transforma la maison en estaminet.
En 1862, celle-ci fut vendue à Émile Coulon, architecte provincial du Brabant, qui transforma le bâtiment en 1889, lui conférant son aspect actuel.
La veuve de l'architecte vendit la ferme en 1905 à la comtesse de Villegas, dont le mari, l'historien Lucien Laudy, rassembla dans la ferme une collection de souvenirs militaires et érigea dans le jardin un petit ossuaire en briques.
En 1951, à la mort de l'historien, la ferme passa à la Société belge d'études napoléoniennes (SBEN) qui aménagea le bâtiment (reconstruit depuis la bataille) en musée napoléonien.
La même année, plus précisément le 14 juin 1951, la ferme, son jardin et ses dépendances sont classés comme monument historique.
Le musée est géré par la province du Brabant depuis 1972 (et par la province du Brabant wallon depuis l'éclatement de la province du Brabant en 1995).
En 2015, le Dernier Quartier Général de Napoléon est modernisé à l'occasion du bicentenaire de 1815,.


== Architecture ==

Le bâtiment, peint en blanc et recouvert de tuiles orange, présente une façade légèrement asymétrique de sept travées percées au rez-de-chaussée et à l'étage de grandes fenêtres rectangulaires à meneau et traverse de bois.
La porte d'entrée, légèrement décentrée, occupe la troisième travée à gauche. Abritée sous un petit porche protégé par une fenêtre d'imposte ornée d'une lettre N en fer forgé inscrite dans un ovale, elle est surmontée du drapeau français et d'une plaque affichant :

Le Caillou
C'est Dans Cette Maison Que
Napoléon
Passa
La Nuit du 17 au 18 juin 1815


== Musée ==
Les collections du musée sont réparties sur cinq salles qui reconstituent l'atmosphère de l'époque : une collection d'armes, de médailles et de maquettes à la gloire de l’empire, des meubles et des objets de l'époque (effets personnels, vaisselle de voyage de Napoléon), des documents d'archives et des diaporamas retracent la campagne de Belgique de 1815.
La salle des aides de camp présente une exposition d'armes et de plans de bataille de Waterloo. La chambre montre un modèle du lit de camp pliable utilisé en campagne par Napoléon, son bureau, ses portraits et bustes en marbre. La salle à manger expose des documents et une reproduction de son masque mortuaire. Dans une salle annexe, une vitrine présente le squelette d'un hussard français tué à la bataille et un grand tableau de François Flameng représentant le maréchal Ney chargeant à la tête de la cavalerie. La cinquième salle accueille des expositions temporaires.
Sa fréquentation en 2012 a été de 7829 entrées.
En vue du bicentenaire de la bataille, des travaux de rénovation sont en cours et un projet de nouvelle scénographie est à l'étude.


== Jardin, statue et ossuaire ==
Dans le jardin du musée, se dresse une statue de Napoléon, œuvre du sculpteur Luigi di Quintana Bellini Trinchi en 2002.
Le jardin abrite également un petit édifice de brique, ossuaire édifié en 1912 pour rassembler des ossements retrouvés dans les champs avoisinants lors de travaux et de fouilles. Il s'agit d'un des très rares édifices funéraires du site de Waterloo.


== Reconstitutions ==


=== Bivouac napoléonien ===
Chaque année, le verger de la Ferme du Caillou accueille un bivouac regroupant un millier de figurants en uniforme venant de huit pays différents, reproduisant celui du 1er bataillon du 1er régiment de chasseurs à pied de la Garde impériale.
Les « Français » s'installent au verger du Caillou tandis que les « Alliés » sont basés au pied de la butte du Lion ou dans le verger de la ferme d'Hougoumont.
Ce bivouac se déroule le week-end du 18 juin ou le week-end le plus proche de cette date.
En 2013, le site accueillait son 14e bivouac napoléonien.


=== Scène du dernier repas de l'empereur ===
Le 21 juin 2014, la scène du dernier repas pris par Napoléon à la veille de la bataille de Waterloo a été reconstituée au domaine provincial du Dernier Quartier général de Napoléon.
Sous la tente impériale, l'état-major de Napoléon a pris un repas composé d'une soupe, d'une bouchée à la reine, d'une friture de rougets et de poulet Marengo.

En 1526, les moines de l'Aubrac (de la domerie) viennent en aide à François Ier pour payer une rançon due aux Italiens après la défaite de Pavie. En signe de reconnaissance, le roi aurait fait remplir le lac de carpes pour que les habitants puissent profiter de cette pêche.

Si sa forme circulaire a pu laisser supposer un temps qu'il s'agissait du cratère d'un ancien volcan, aujourd'hui, il est clairement établi que le lac de Born est un lac de surcreusement glaciaire (comme tous les autres lacs de l'Aubrac). Sa faible profondeur (une dizaine de mètres environ) l'atteste de manière indiscutable. En effet, les lacs de cratère sont en général bien plus profonds (voir le lac Pavin).

Deux poèmes orphiques ont été attribués à Brontinos : Sur la nature (Physika) et un autre, La robe et le filet a également été attribué à Zopyre d’Héraclée, l’un des Homérides.
Sa renommée était suffisante pour qu'une œuvre apocryphe lui fût attribuée dans la littérature néo-pythagoricienne. Syrianos se réfère à Brontinos comme un auteur posant que la monade, ou cause première, « transcende toutes sortes de raison et d'essence en puissance et en dignité », tentative permettant d'insérer un élément de platonisme dans le pythagorisme.

842,"Le Colorado Midland Railway (sigle de l'AAR: CM), était un chemin de fer américain de classe I qui fut créé en 1883. Il fut le premier chemin de fer à écartement standard à franchir la ligne continentale de séparation des eaux dans le Colorado grâce à l'Hagerman Tunnel. Traversant les Rocheuses, il reliait Colorado Springs à Grand Junction via Leadville, avec un embranchement vers Aspen. Il fut successivement contrôlé par les compagnies Santa Fe et Rio Grande. La compagnie financièrement à bout, et en compétition avec le Rio Grande fut la première des grandes compagnies de classe I à cesser ses opérations dès 1918 après 35 ans de service.


== Histoire ==

Le Colorado Midland Railway fut créé le 23 novembre 1883 pour relier Colorado Springs à Aspen où se trouvaient des mines d'argent. John J Hagerman prit le contrôle de la compagnie en juin 1885. En 1886, il était prévu de lancer la construction à partir de Leadville, mais face aux coûts élevés réclamés par le Rio Grande pour le transport des matériaux de construction, Hagerman décida de partir de Colorado Springs en direction de Ute Pass et de Leadville. Dans le même temps, il lança les travaux de percement de l'Hagerman Tunnel (3 514 m) près du col d'Hagerman Pass (3 635 m), à l'ouest de Leadville entre le Turquoise Lake et l'Ivanhoe Lake. La ""High Line"" avec son tunnel de 659 m qui franchissait la ligne de séparation des eaux, fut ouverte le 30 août 1887. La même année, la ligne fut achevée vers Glenwood Springs ainsi que l'embranchement vers Aspen. Mais son concurrent, le Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, parvint à relier Aspen 1 semaine plus tôt.
Pour traverser le Colorado, la compagnie réussit la prouesse de franchir 3 sommets : à Hayden Divide (à l'ouest de Colorado Springs), à Trout Creek Pass, et à Hagerman Pass. Le Colorado Midland sut s'affranchir du problème posé par la topographie, mais il fut incapable de résoudre seul celui posé par son terminus de Grand Junction qui ne permettait qu'une connexion avec son rival le Rio Grande, alors que s'il avait prolongé sa ligne jusqu'à Ogden, Utah, il aurait pu correspondre avec l'Union Pacific Railroad et le Southern Pacific Railroad.
L'exploitation de la « High Line » était ingrate et les accidents fréquents. Le déneigement en hiver grevait sérieusement les revenus. Il était évident que la compagnie connaitrait des difficultés financières dans un avenir proche. C'est pourquoi en 1888, la compagnie lança des études pour un nouveau tunnel de 1 189 m entre Busk et l'Ivanhoe Lake qui serait percé 183 m plus bas.


=== Le Santa Fe et le Colorado Midland Railroad ===
En 1890, Hagerman vendit le Colorado Midland Railway à l'Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway qui le rebaptisa Colorado Midland Railroad. Le Santa Fe décida de lancer le percement du Busk - Ivanhoe Tunnel. Faute d'argent, le chantier fut confié à une compagnie indépendante appelée Busk Tunnel Railway qui prévoyait de louer le tunnel au Colorado Midland. Pour faciliter l'exploitation, la construction du contournement de Leadville, d'une longueur de 11 km avec une rampe plus douce, fut confié à l'Aspen Shortline Railway, car la santé financière du Colorado Midland n'inspirait aucune confiance.
Le premier train emprunta le nouveau tunnel en 1893. Cette même année, un arrangement fut trouvé avec le Rio Grande pour construire une ligne commune jusqu'à Grand Junction et permettre une connexion vers Salt Lake City et Ogden. Il y avait plusieurs raisons à la création de cette compagnie commune baptisée Rio Grande Junction Railway, dont l'une était l'étroitesse du canyon qu'il fallait emprunter. Le 23 décembre 1893, le Santa Fe et sa filiale Colorado Midland furent placés en redressement judiciaire. En 1895, un administrateur judiciaire fut attribué spécifiquement au Colorado Midland.


=== Le Rio Grande et le Colorado Midland Railway ===
En 1897, la compagnie fut réorganisée sous le nom de Colorado Midland Railway, à l'exclusion singulière du Busk Tunnel Railway (exploitant du Busk – Ivanhoe Tunnel).
Les rails de la vieille « High Line » via le Hagerman Tunnel furent remis en état, et les trains reprirent le service. Mais l'hiver 1899 fut particulièrement rigoureux et démontra combien le choix de la highline avait été désastreux: l'Hagerman Pass fut fermé 78 jours d'affilée à cause du blizzard, les fraises de déneigement se bloquaient, un train chargé de bétails fut immobilisé dans la neige provoquant la mort de tous les animaux, et des vies humaines furent perdues en voulant lutter contre la neige.
Avant la fin de l'année, la compagnie accepta sa défaite et racheta le Busk Ivanhoe Tunnel et déposa les rails de la Highline. Mais cette charge financière eut raison du Colorado Midland. En 1900, le Denver and Rio Grande et le Colorado and Southern Railway prirent chacun 50 % du Colorado Midland. Le Rio Grande qui avait plus de trafic qu'il ne pouvait écouler sur sa ligne, fut ravi de pouvoir se délester sur le réseau du Colorado Midland. En 1908, le Colorado and Southern fut racheté par le Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q). En 1914, le Rio Grande racheta les 25 % que le Colorado Midland détenait dans le Rio Grande Junction Railway, ce qui lui permit de contrôler une ligne ininterrompue vers l'ouest.
La majorité du trafic restant sur le Colorado Midland provenait des mines d'argent de la région de Cripple Creek, et des mines de charbon de Glenwood Springs. Lorsque le cours de l'argent s'effondra au début des années 1900, la banqueroute du Colorado Midland fut inévitable, et il fut à nouveau placé en redressement judiciaire en 1912.


=== Le Colorado Midland Railroad ===
Le Colorado Midland fit banqueroute le 21 avril 1917, et fut vendu aux enchères à Albert E. Carlton de Colorado Springs, qui le rebaptisa à nouveau Colorado Midland Railroad. Lors de cette opération, le Colorado and Southern et le Rio Grande perdirent tous leurs investissements. Cependant, le Rio Grande conservait toujours sa ligne directe vers Grand Junction.
Malheureusement, les projets de Carlton furent ruinés par l'entrée en guerre des États-Unis. En 1918, l'USRA décida que pour optimiser l'effort de guerre, tout le trafic marchandise devait transiter sur le Rio Grande, et que les rails du Colorado Midland devaient être arrachés et envoyés en France. Ce dernier ordre ne fut pas suivi. Un dernier train spécial circula en 1919 pour tenter de montrer l'intérêt de la ligne, mais cela ne déboucha sur rien et le Colorado Midland fut dissous en 1921. Ce fut à l'époque la plus grande démolition de ligne de chemin de fer de tous les États-Unis.


== L'équipement ==
Au moment de sa construction, le Midland faisait partie des compagnies les mieux équipées des États-Unis. Dix des locomotives qu'il acheta entre 1886 et 1887 (des Classe 115 de type 2-8-0) comptaient parmi les plus grosses et les plus puissantes Consolidations du pays. Le manque de capitaux milita contre le remplacement des machines. La plupart des locomotives achetées durant la première décennie de son existence, étaient toujours en service lorsqu'il stoppa son activité en 1918. Le Midland acheta ses dernières Consolidations de Classe 175 en 1907.


== Les vestiges ==


=== Le Busk – Ivanhoe Tunnel ===
Après la destruction de la ligne, le Busk – Ivanhoe Tunnel commença une nouvelle carrière comme tunnel routier sous le nom de Carlton Tunnel. Comme il était très étroit, il ne laissait passer qu'une route à une voie (HWY 105), dont le sens changeait toutes les 30 min. La circulation prit fin en 1945 lorsque le tunnel s'effondra. Il fut racheté en 1957 par une compagnie des eaux qui le restaura pour 500 000 $. Il achemine désormais de l'eau.


=== Le Ute Pass ===

Situé à l'ouest de Colorado Springs, près de Cascade, l'Ute Pass est le col le plus accessible. De nombreux petits tunnels sont encore visibles.


=== L'Hagerman Pass ===
Pour retrouver ce passage, il faut partir de Leadville en direction de l'ouest sur la Turquoise View Road, puis prendre la Forest Road FR 105. Lorsque celle-ci se sépare en 2, il faut suivre le chemin le plus au sud jusqu'à Busk Creek où la route s'arrête. L'entrée du Busk – Ivanhoe Tunnel se trouve à proximité. Des pointillés indiquent le chemin pédestre qui suit l'ancienne ligne. Le FR 105 continue de l'autre côté vers Basalt et Carbondale, où il retrouve la HWY 133.


=== Le Hagerman Tunnel ===
Accessible uniquement en tout terrain ou à pied, l'entrée du tunnel n'est pas facile à trouver à cause des éboulements. Il est impraticable car rempli d'eau.

843,"David Garrard, né le 14 février 1978 à East Orange (New Jersey), est un joueur américain de football américain évoluant au poste de quarterback.


== Carrière ==


=== Avec les Jaguars de Jacksonville ===
Il est drafté en 2002 à la 108e position (quatrième tour) par les Jaguars de Jacksonville. Destiné à remplacer Mark Brunell, c'est finalement Byron Leftwich qui est titulaire durant la saison 2003, et qui le reste pour les quatre saisons suivantes, bien qu'il le remplace régulièrement en cas de blessure.
Pour la saison 2007, à la suite d'une excellente pré-saison de sa part, il est désigné titulaire de l'attaque des Jaguars. Bien qu'il rate quatre matchs du fait de blessure, il mène son équipe au bilan de 11-5 et termine avec 2509 yards, 18 touchdowns, un record NFL de 3 interceptions et un rating de 102.2. En play-offs, il parvient à battre les Steelers de Pittsburgh durant le match de wild-card, avant d'échouer face aux futurs finalistes du Super Bowl XLVI et alors invaincus Patriots de la Nouvelle-Angleterre.
Durant la saison 2009, il lance pour 3597 yards, 15 touchdowns et 10 interceptions, mène son équipe au bilan de 7-9 et reçoit sa première sélection au Pro Bowl.
Malgré une saison 2010 meilleure que la précédente, les Jaguars sélectionnent Blaine Gabbert au premier tour de la Draft, et libèrent ensuite Garrard.


=== Avec les Dolphins de Miami ===
Le 19 mars 2012, il est recruté par les Dolphins de Miami. Néanmoins, il se blesse durant l'été, et est libéré par l'équipe avant le début de la saison 2012.


=== Avec les Jets de New York ===
Le 11 mars 2013, il signe avec les Jets de New York. Alors qu'il est considéré comme un bon choix pour mettre de la pression sur Mark Sanchez, les blessures au genou qu'il a contracté durant l'été dernier avec les Dolphins réapparaissent au cours des camps d'entraînement, et l'obligent à quitter l'équipe le 15 mars 2013.Il prend sa retraite après la blessure des camps d'entraînements

Le 15 mars 1954, Léo Ferré enregistre sous l'égide de l'arrangeur Jean Faustin une première version de cette chanson, restée à ce jour introuvable.
Sa maison de disques Odéon lui présente alors l'accordéoniste Jean Cardon, qui va devenir un accompagnateur fidèle - son seul et unique accordéoniste - jusqu'en 1963. Ensemble et avec quelques autres musiciens dirigés par Jean Faustin, ils enregistrent la version studio définitive de cette chanson le 7 avril 1954.
Ferré l'interprètera sur scène lors de son passage en vedette à l'Olympia de Paris en 1955 (voir Récital Léo Ferré à l'Olympia).

847,"Le musée Hergé est un musée consacré à l'auteur belge de bandes dessinées Hergé, créateur des Aventures de Tintin, de Quick et Flupke et de Jo, Zette et Jocko, Popol et Virginie et de Totor, CP des Hanetons.


== Historique ==
Situé à Louvain-la-Neuve (province du Brabant wallon), le bâtiment de 3 600 m2 a été dessiné par l'architecte français Christian de Portzamparc et a officiellement ouvert ses portes le 2 juin 2009. Il comporte huit salles d'exposition permanente, une salle pour exposition temporaire, une muséographie interactive où Hergé raconte par enregistrements interposés, quelques secrets de son succès planétaire, une reconstitution de son studio de création, plus de 80 planches originales, 800 photos et documents inédits. Stéphane Steeman, grand connaisseur de Hergé céda une partie de sa collection à Fanny Rodwell, veuve de Hergé, en espérant la création de ce musée. Sa construction, 15 millions d'euros, a été financée sur fonds propres par Fanny Rodwell-Vlamynck, la seconde épouse d'Hergé, administratrice de la société Moulinsart, gestionnaire de l’œuvre littéraire d'Hergé, tandis que le terrain a été mis à disposition par l'université de Louvain. Les Studios Hergé comptaient initialement y attirer 200 000 visiteurs par an. Le musée a reçu un total de 400 000 visiteurs durant ses 5 premières années d'activité.
Le projet initial de l'héritière d'Hergé et de son mari, Nick Rodwell, était de créer le musée à Bruxelles. Des contacts avaient été établis avec Henri Simons, échevin de la Ville chargé de la culture. La localisation proposée par celui-ci dans un quartier en transition sociale et urbanistique n'ayant pas convenu aux créateurs du musée, ils ont établi des contacts avec les autorités de Louvain-la-Neuve.


== Le Petit Vingtième ==

Le Musée Hergé dispose d'un café-restaurant nommé le Petit Vingtième en référence au supplément jeunesse du quotidien catholique conservateur Vingtième siècle qui a publié pour la première fois les aventures du célèbre reporter Tintin (10 janvier 1929).


== Critiques ==
Lors la présentation du bâtiment à la presse le 25 mai 2009, celle-ci ne put ni photographier, ni filmer l'ensemble des pièces exposées « pour éviter une multitude de prises de vue des originaux qui sont exposés dans les salles ». Ceci provoqua la colère de certains journalistes, qui quittèrent l'inauguration.
La construction du Musée Hergé a en outre entraîné la fermeture de la Maison des Jeunes de Louvain-la-Neuve, le bâtiment qu'elle occupait et qui se situait aux abords de l'actuel emplacement du musée ayant été rasé.


== Accès ==
La gare de Louvain-la-Neuve-Université est située à 400 m du musée, la gare des bus TEC (notamment terminus des Conforto et Rapido Bus) se trouvant à 500 m.

854,"""Ignoramus et ignorabimus"" est praeceptum ab Aemilio du Bois-Reymond, physiologo Germanico, anno 1872 datum, quo de finibus cognitionis scientificae monuit. In libro enim Über die Grenzen des Naturerkennens ('De finibus scientiae naturae') inscripto ita docuit:


== Responsum Hilbertianum ==
Die 8 Septembris 1930, mathematicus David Hilbert se in celebri Societatis Scientistarum et Medicorum Germanorum in urbe Regiomontio habita contione dissidere nuntiavit:
Nobis necesse est non credere eos qui hodie, philosophici visu gravesque auditu, casum culturae praedicant et ignorabimus tolerent. Nobis non est ignorabimus, et mea sententia nihil minime in scientia naturali habemus. Contra ignorabimus ineptum, nostrum dictum erit: Wir müssen wissen: wir werden wissen! ['Nobis est sciendum! Sciemus!']Iam anno 1900, in Congressu Internationali Mathematicorum Lutetiae dixerat ""in mathematica non esse ignorabimus."" Ipse aliique formalistae laborabant ut stabilia fundamenta mathematicae saeculo vicensimo ineunte instituerent. Gödeliana autem imperfectionis theoremata anno 1931 probaverunt nullum systema axiomatum, si tam multiplex ut nostram arithmeticam usitatam exprimerent, umquam proposita programmatis Hilbertiani conficere posse, multa Hilberti proposita fieri non posse demonstrans, et fines plurimorum systematum axiomaticorum denotans.


== Septem ""aenigmata mundi"" ==
Aemilius du Bois-Reymond locutione ignoramus et ignorabimus usus est cum res disceptaret quas ""aenigmata mundi"" in oratione anno 1880 prae Academia Beroliensi Scientiarum appellavit, adumbrans quidem septem aenigmata, quorum tria, declaravit, nec scientia nec philosophia umquam explicare posse, quia ""transcendentia"" sunt. Ex aenigmatibus, consideravit sequentia transcendentalia, quorum declaravit ignoramus et ignorabimus: ""1. extrema materiae et virium natura, 2. origo motus, . . . 5. origo simplicium sensuum, quaestio transcendentissima."" Secundum autem interpretationem ""naturae ultimae"" et ""originis,"" nonnulla horum aenigmatum partim aut omnino soluta putari possunt. Exempli gratia, systemata sensoria sensuum usitatorum (visus, auditus, gustatus, oflactio, tactus) nunc plerumque intelleguntur, cum nonnullis ex rationibus nervorum consociatis.


== Responsa sociologica ==
Sociologus Wolf Lepenies ignorabimus explicavit significans du Bois-Reymond se re vera ex suis argumentis de scientia et eius captu non recipere: ""id re vera est subsidium incredibiliter confidens superbiae scientificae ut modestia simulata.""Hoc dictum in disceptatione Friderici Wolters fit, sodalis ""Circuli Georgiani,"" gregis litterarii Germanici. Lepenies dicit Wolters non recte intellexisse gradum pessimismi de scientia expressum, sed significationem bene intellexere scientistas commendari non posse ut se ipsos iudicent.

879,"Leo Trotski, plenius Leo Davidis filius Trotski (Russice Лев Давидович Троцкий, Lev Davidovič Trockij, cuius nomen primum erat Лейба seu Лев Давидович Бронштейн vel translitteratione scientifica internationali Lejba seu Lev Davidovič Bronštejn), fuit rerum novator, philosophus, rerum gestarum scriptor Ruthenus. Praefuit Consilio Petropolitano anno 1905 et 1917, rerum eversione coorta, intra conditores reipublicae quae URSS inscribitur fuit. Obiit spartas varias novo sub regimine donec, iussu inimici Stalinis, in exilium profectus est ad litora Mexicana.


== De iuventute ==
Leo Bronstein natus est die 7 Novembris 1879 (26 Octobris, calendario Iuliano) a divite familia agricolarum Iudaeorum in praedolio rustico prope vicum Ianovka gubernii Chersonensis Imperii Russici (qui nunc est vicus Bereslavka regionis Kirovohradensis Ucrainae). Dum versatur in universitate urbis Odessae, nactus est viros qui motus ordebantur, itaque rebus novis incipit studere. Anno 1900, ut legum praevaricator iniectus in cellam promptuariam est Odessae (ibi e nomine clavicularii accepit nomen Trotski), posteaque iussus est in exsilium proficisci ad fines Siberianos. Quamvis teriturus esset quattuor annos hoc in carcere, anno 1902 datum ei fuit e Siberia fugere atque, tota Europa emensa, deverticulum invenire Londinii. Hic ad amicitiam pervenit cum Vladimiro Lenino, qui illis temporibus ephemeridi nomine Iskra ('Fomes') preaerat. Anno 1903, cum bellum acre opponeret propositiones Mensevicorum et Bolscevicorum, Trotski maluit se iungere cum Mensevicis: quod valde exitiale fuit in amicitia cum magistro Bolsevicorum Lenino.


== De Motibus ac Bello Civili ==

Anno 1905, se revertit in fines Russicos, sed, cum interfuisset universali reclamationi mensis Octobris, palam commendavisset res novas et Consilio (seu Soviet) Petropolitano praefuisset, rursus trusus ex liminibus Russicis est, utpote damnatus tamquam reipublicae turbator exsilio. Dum initium dant novatores russici mensis Februarii anno 1917 Motui, quo nutavit et occidit Tzaris monarchia, in Novum Eboracum versabatur. Cum in Russiam redivisset, cum factioni Bolsevicorum se iunxit, in qua valde polluit. Mense Octobri eodem anno, album calculum addidit ad regimen temporarium Alexandri Kerenski delendum.
Cum creata esset URSS, factus est populi legatus ad res externas praepositus, porroque ad res militares. Interea, novum exercitum reipublicae instruxit, scilicet Copias Rubras.
Cum fine belli mundani primi anno 1918 de instrumento pacis Bressiciensis ageretur fuit dux partium Russicarum post Adolfum Ioffe. Inter fata belli civilis, quo Albae Copiae ducibus Kornilovo ac Denikini arma in Bolsevicos novumque regimen contulerunt, Trotski dux fuit Copiarum Rubrarum, atque habetur primus auctor rubrorum victoriae.


== De adversatione Stalini et morte ==
Lenino anno 1924 mortuo, statim collineabantur Stalin et sui, praecipue Gregorius Zinoviev et Leo Kamenev, qui versabatur in triumviratu (Russice тройка, trojka), quibus valde salivam movebat edita munera factionis communisticae obire, se exparte Trotskis expediri, brevique Trotski coactus est abdicare exofficio legati populi ad res militares ac navales. Hinc factio Trotskiana instructa est versus factionem Stalinianam, ac vocitata est ""Sinistrae Adversatio."" Ut patefaciamus propositiones aliquas quibus Stalini pugnabat Trotski, dicamus in summa tales erant:

 Curare ut agricolae reipublicae se ULTRO subicierent ad telluris unionem;
 Auctum manufacturarum commendare;
 Burocratiae perversionique rerum novarum obniti, tueri vero theorias veras placitorum Marxianorum.
 NEP (i.e., Novum Regimen Oeconomicum) cohibere, ne novus ordo optimatum eo exsurgeret.Sed propositio strenuissime tuenda a parte Trotskiana erat ""theoria perpetue novandi"" seu ""revolutionis permanentis"", qua contendebatur ut necesse esset non in Russia tantum, sed quidem in omnem orbem gentium placita Marxiana eiciere. E diametro obiectus, Stalin theoriam ""Communismi una in republica introducendi"" vocitatam autumabat. Anno 1927, factio adversatorum ut seorsum rerum novarum natalium celebrarent orta est, sed mastigophori reipublicae iussi sunt eos cohibere atque prohibere. Statim Trotski Zinovievque trusi sunt e Factione Communistica Sovietica, utpote noxii populo iudicati. Primum fugit Almatrum, tum in Turciam, deinde in Franciam et Norvegiam, postremo in Mexicum, ubi ab Iosephi Stalin agenti in rebus interfectus est.

De suo nomine scripsit in autobiographia in capitulo de ""prima fuga"": ""Manibus tenui Homerum a Gniedicio hexametris Russis scriptum. In pera habui syngraphum cui ipse fortuito nomen Trotski inscripseram. Nesciebam id per omnem vitam futuram meum nomen factum iri.""

951,"Clemens Brentano (natus die 8 Septembris 1778 in Ehrenbreitstein apud Confluentes (Germania), mortuus die 28 Iulii 1842 Asciburgi) Germanicus poeta fuit. Genus Romanticismi fovebat. Pater  Petrus Antonius e Langobardia venit, mater Maximiliana filia scriptricis Sophiae Laroche fuit. Clementi soror Elisabetha uxor Achim von Arnim fuit.


== Vita ==
Voluerunt familiares Clementem nolentem mercatorem fieri. Cum horae in officiis negotiatoriis peractae ad irritum irent, licuit gymnasium frequentare. Patre decesso (anno 1797) Ienam petivit, ubi Romaticismi fautores convenit et multa iocosa egit. Usque annum 1804 multa itinera fecit et vixit Dresdae, Ienae, Marburgi (apud Fridericum Carolum de Savigny), Francofurti et Vindobonae. Reversus est Marburgum ubi apud Ernestum de Lasaulx degebat. Isto tempore mythistoriam phantasticam »Godwi, oder das steinerne Bild der Mutter« scripsit sub pseudonymo Mariae (Bremen 1800–1802, 2 partes). Anno 1801 complicata comoedia ludis philologicis pullulans  »Ponce de Leon« (Göttingen 1804), anno 1802 Dusseldorpii melodramaticum opus »Die lustigen Musikanten« (Frankfurt 1803), anno 1803  »Chronika eines fahrenden Schülers« (editio nova, Berolini 1872) apparuerunt.
Anno 1803 in matrimonium duxit Sophiam Mereau, quae divortium fecerat cum professore aliquo Ienensi et ipse scripserat »Gedichte« (Berolini 1800–1802, 2 vol.) et plures fabulas Milesias (»e.g. Kalathiskos«). Anno 1805 Heidelbergam iit ubi consuetudinem intimam contraxit cum Iosepho Görres et Achim von Arnim. Cum illo edidit collectiones cantilenarum popularium »Des Knaben Wunderhorn« (Heidelbergae 1806–1808, 3 partes) et anno 1808 periodicum »Einsiedlerzeitung« (postea »Tröst-Einsamkeit«) quod querelas cum Ioanne Henrico Voß provocavit.  Tunc etiam pepigit »Der erste Bärenhäuter«. Die 31.10.1806 ex inopinatu uxor animam efflavit. Anno sibi despondebat Augustam Busmann, filiam fratris hominis argentarii Bethmann. Nuptiae Cassellae factae sunt - sed divortium mox secutum est.
Deinde Landishutam iit et anno 1809 Berolinum, ubi pergebat opusculum poeticum »Romanzen vom Rosenkranz«, historiam Fausticam non doctam et scripsit »Der Philister vor, in und nach der Geschichte« (Berolini 1811, paucissimis in exemplaribus editum - tamen laudatissimum quoddam opus). Sese contulit in Bohemiam in familiae praedium Bukowan a fratre Christiano (1784-1851) curatum. Post unum annum, cum drama historicum »Die Gründung Prags« (Aquinci 1815) exaravisset, Vindobonam iit. Ibi velocissime scripsit anno 1813 für pro Scaenis imperialibus spectaculum »Am Rhein, am Rhein!« et pro Theatro ad flumen Wien »Viktoria und ihre Geschwister« (Berolini 1817), quod tamen numquam publice praesentatum est. Inde Berolinum revenit, ubi scripsit historias optimas praetitulatas »Geschichte vom braven Kasperl und dem schönen Annerl«, »Die mehreren Wehmüller« et »Die drei Nüsse«. 
Hic mutatio eius in religiosis facta est. Catholicus vivax  munditia mundana reliquit et ultramontanismo favere coepit. Autumno anni 1818 iit ad Dülmen ubi apud domnam quandam visiones accipientem (Anna Catharina Emmerich) usque eius mortem anno 1824 mansit. Eius visiones conscripsit, quarum nonnullae vel publicatae sunt. Postea denuo magis iucunde vixit diversis in locis: Bonnae, Winkel am Rhein, Aquis Mattiacis, Francofurti, Argentorati (apud Görres) Confluentibus. Confluentibus mansit longum tempus, antequam anno 1833 Monacum iret. Ultimum opus venit anno 1838 in versione sua aucta: agitur de fabula »Gockel, Hinkel und Gackeleia« (nova editio, Ratisbonae 1880). Mense Novembri anni 1841, frater iussit illum aegrotatum Asciburgum venire.


== Gravitudo ==
Clementi Brentano phantasia sensusque infinita erant. Quia nonnumquam afuit laboris amor haud ultra attinxit quoad compositionem operum. Tamquam lyricus in cantilenis minoribus et romanticis optimus citharoedus fuit: simplicitas eorum popularitatem valde auxit. Fabulae eius »Märchen« (scriptae iam anno 1811) captant tam phantasia romantica quam argumentis.

964,"Tenedos vel Tenedus (Turcice: Bozcaada; Graece: Τένεδος), est insula areae 43 km² in mari Aegaeo boreo-orientali sive in mari Thracico urbi antiquae Troiae vicina sita, quae ad provinciam Turcicam Çanakkale (Dardanellia) pertinet. Appellatio antiqua a rege quodam sapienti mythologiae Graecae, Tenes nomine, deducta esse traditur, cui mortuo honores divi fuissent.


== Mythologica ==
Vergilius refert Graecos bello Troiano multos annos gesto denique equum ligneum in litore Troiano reliquisse classemque prope Tenedum occultavisse. Idem praeterea narrat duos angues a Minerva missos a Tenedo per mare venisse; illos in litore Laocoonta et filios eius necavisse, quia Laocoon Troianos monuisset, ne equum ligneum intra muros Troiae traherent.


== Historia ==
Circa annum 3000 a.C.n. primi incolae Tenedi sedes collocaverunt. Ab anno 493 a.C.n. insula ad Regnum Persarum pertinuit, anno 334 a.C.n. copiae Alexandri Magni Tenedum occupaverunt, anno 146 a.C.n. pars Imperii Romani facta est.
Saeculo XIII medio Imperium Romanum Orientale cum Venetis ac Genuensibus de insula pugnavit; inde fere saeculum deserta erat. Anno 1455 a copiis Mahometi II expugnata et pars Imperii Ottomanici facta est.
Anno 1922/1923 Tenedos una cum Imbros bello Graeco-Turcico confecto pacto Lausannensi Turciae addicta est. Imprimis ab annis 1950 maxima Graecorum pars fugata est.


== Res oeconomicae ==
Tenedos semper fuit portus magni momenti prope aditum Hellesponti. Praeterea minime a saeculo VI a.C.n. vitium cultura in insula attestata est. His diebus imprimis periegesis quaestum praebet, praeterea energia e vento producta, piscatio et papaveris cultura.


== Visu digna ==
Castrum in insulae portu sita ignotae originis est. Formam hodiernam Mahometo II (et instaurationibus posterioribus) debet. Ecclesia Orthodoxa anno 1867 aedificata in fundamentis ecclesiae a Venetis erectae posita esse dicitur.


== Festum ==
Vinalia quotannis die 26 Iulii celebrantur. Ut huic festivitati intersint, multi Graeci, qui in diaspora habitant, Tenedum iter faciunt.

1058,"Cicha (Hispanice: Chicha) est genus potionum fermentatarum late in America Australi usitatum. Tales potiones iam a populis Andesensibus ante Incas confectae sunt. Sub Incis mulieres artifices (aqllas) artem braxatoriam in scholis docebant.


== Usus ==
Cicha millennia inter civitates Andaeas paratur, consumatur. Incae cicha in caerimoniis utebantur. Nuper autem cicha translaticia rarius in tempus fit. In parvulis oppidis tantum Peruanis australibus et Bolivianis adhuc paratur.
In Peruvia autem cicha matura quasi vino coquinario utitur.


== Varietates ==
Cicha saepe ex specie quadam maizii fieri solet quae lingua Quechua qora, Hispanice jora dicitur. Colore est stramineo, aspectu aliquanto lacteo, secondario autem gustu subaustero. Vel recens dulcisque, vel matura fortisque potari potest. Cicha ut fiat maizio germinato, sacchari extrahuntur, farrago elixatur, omnia magnis vasibus (more maiorum fictilibus) complures dies simul fermentantur.
In Peruvia:
Limae cicha fit ex maizio purpureo. Dulcis est, et frigida potatur.
Cuzci arbuta cichae additur ut ""fructilla"" fiat.
Puni cicha nonnumquam ex quinoa fit pallidissima, paene candida.
Aiacuchi ""cicha septem seminum"" crassa et sapida fit ex maizio, tritico, hordeo et lente.
Huantae cicha e molle ex parvulis seminibus subrubris arboris Schinus molle fit. Rarissima et subtilior est.

In Venetiolae maioribus urbibus, cicha solet ex oryza fieri elixa, saccharo, lacte, glacie concisa, et cinnamono (cf. hordeata). Regionibus autem Andaeis exstat versio ex malo pineo.
In Chilia fit ex uvis, et solemniis diei 18 Septembris autonomiae potatur.
In Chilia etiam e malis fit.
In regionibus Columbiae Cicha fit ex maizio, iucca, quinoa, malo pineo, oryza, vel tuberosolano, e regione pendente. Sunt etiam praecepta quibus insunt cannabis vel coca.
Nonnullis nationibus Hispanice loquentium, ""cicha"" indicat potionem debilem, vel etiam sucum.

1065,"Four Saints in Three Acts ('Quattuor sancti in tribus actibus') est opera a Vergilio Thomson, compositore Americano, libello Geretrudis Stein annis 1927 et 1928 constituto. Res, suum titulum festive contradicens, circa viginti sanctos in saltem quattuor actibus comprehendit. Opera forma, argumento, vestimentis, scaenae apparatu, et distributione partium fuit mirum spectaculum scaenicum. Omnes cantores fuerunt Afroamericani, Eva Jessye, directore chorali Afriamericana duce.Thomson rem proposuit, libellusque inter opera collecta Steiniana legi potest. Opera duos sanctos saeculi sexti decimi vehementius dicit: Ignatium de Loyola, olim militem, et Teresiam Abulensem, monacham mysticam. Implicat praeterea eorum comites, genuinos et fictos, inter quos Saint Plan ('Sanctus Propositum'), Saint Settlement ('Sanctus Pactum'), Saint Plot ('Sanctus Argumentum'), et Saint Chavez. Thomson partes Sanctae Teresiae dividit inter duas cantrices, Sanctam Teresiam Primam et Sanctam Teresiam Alteram, et arbitores sollemnes (Compère et Commère, ad verbum 'sponsores loco infantis') addidit ut directiones scaenicas Steinianas canerent.


== Argumentum ==
Postquam chorus praeludium canit, primus actus, ""St. Teresa half indoors and half out of doors,"" in cathedrale Abulensi fit. Alter actus, ""Might it be mountains if it were not Barcelona,"" telescopium et aspectus domus caelestis implicat. Tertius actus, ""St. Ignatius and one of two literally"" ('Sanctus Ignatius et una ex duabus ad verbum') est convivium sub divo, et ""Pigeons on the grass alas"" ('Columbae in gramine, eheu'), praeclaram Ignatii ariam, continet; saltatione tango simile finitur. Actus quartus, ""The sisters and saints reassembled and re-enacting why they went away to stay,"" in horto monasterii constituitur. Antequam aulaeum in ultimo descendit, Compère nuntiat ""Last act"" ('Actus ultimus'), chorusque respondet ""Which is a fact"" ('Quod est factum').


== Dramatis personae ==
In distributionibus partium productionis primae fuerunt:

Eduardus Matthews, ""St Ignatius"" (baritonus)
Beatricia Robinson-Wayne, ""St Teresa I"" (supranus)
Bruce Howard, ""St Teresa II"" (contraltus)
Embry Bonner, ""St. Chavez"" (tenor)
Bertha Fitzhugh Baker, ""St. Settlement"" (sopranus)

Abner Dorsey, ""the Compère"" (bassus)
Altonnell Hines, ""the Commere"" (mediosupranus)

The Eva Jessye Choir, Eva Jessye duce


== Productiones ==
Opera, primum in Athenaeo Wadsworthiano Hartfordiae die 7 Februarii 1934 producta, in Broadway 20 Februarii 1934 inaugurata est. Multas operae proprietates usitatas insigniter contempsit. Libellus sonos vocabulorum potius narrationem pressit. Musica insolita et adeo avant-garde fuit per simplicitatem ipsam. Eva Jessye, praecursor musicae nigrae Novi Eboraci, cantores et suum chorus in productione direxit. Ioannes Houseman, annos triginta unum natu, qui nuper theatrum animadvertere coeperat post cursum dardanarii in internationali frumenti macello, productionem direxit.Scaenae primae productionis, ab artifice Florina Stettheimer designatae, apparatus scaenicus ex cellophane factum comprehenderunt, atque vestimenta (etiam Stettheimerana) fuerunt opus reticulatum, sericum, et taffeta multorum colorum. Fridericus Ashton choreographiam excogitavit, postquam Georgius Balanchine opus recusaverat. Etiam insolita fuit depictio sanctorum Europaeorum ab actoribus Afroamericanis, res in historia Americana inaudita. Hae proprietates insolitae fecerunt ut prima productio esset prospera populoque bene accepta. Critici autem inter se discrepaverunt, sed spectatores mundum probaverunt phantasticum ad vitam perductum ab actoribus qui vocabula, melodias, motus vivide expresserunt.
Opera ut oratorium deinde acta est, ut in emissionibus radiophonicis annis 1942 et 1947. Productiones scaenici annis 1952 et 1973 productae sunt. Novi Eboraci anno 1981, spectaculum concertatum pro celebratione diei natalis octogensimi quinti Thomsoniani actus est. Hac in actione, Elizabetha Allen, Gwendolyn Bradley, Gulielmus Brown, Clamma Dale, Beniaminus Matthews, Florentia Quivar, et Arthurus Thompson partes principales cecinerunt. Etiam fuerunt productiones a Roberto Wilson et choreographo Marco Morris ductae, qui saltationem pro opera excogitavit.

1079,"Memum (Anglice meme) est quidquid per variorum morum et consuetudinum aliorumque exemplorum imitationem multiplicatur atque inter homines communicatur. Saepe cum idea comparatur; re vera, quam ob rem duobus opus sit terminis idem fere valentibus, nonnumquam quaeritur. At cum in ideis (opinionibus, existimationibus, religionibus, doctrinis, cett.) de rebus significativis agatur, memi proprium est per selectionem et successionem superstitare et sua sponte mutari. Mema enim sunt aemulae informationis particulae, quae sibi ipsis consulentes certatim se multiplicare suumque locum tenere contendunt. Constat memum ad vocabulum q.e. genum fictum esse. Ideo aliquando ""genum culturale"" appellari solet.
Studium memorum memetica appellatur.   


== De origine ==
Anno 1976, Ricardus Dawkins, biologus Britannicus, librum The Selfish Gene ('De geno sibi consulenti') inscriptum edidit. Quo opere omnes animantes arguit genis sibi ipsis consulentibus inservire: Genum enim organismum construere, quo velut superstitandi machina usum se multiplicet. Quo in opere etiam sui multiplicatorem alterius generis proposuit, qui per successiones non biologicas (ut genum) sed sociales se multiplicando superstitet. Hunc multiplicatorem dixit per imitationem vel mimesin communicari ac propagari. Itaque Dawkins in animo habebat vocabuli Graeci q.e. μίμημα 'imitamentum, simulamen' formam Anglice mimeme redditam, cui quidem primam syllabam abscidit, ut vocem cum vocabulo q.e.gene 'genum' melius concinentem fingeret. Nempe eadem ratione etiam memum ad genum fictum est.

Ferdinandus I regna sua divisit inter filios. Sanctius primogenitus accepit patriam patris (Castellam) dum fratres ei acceperunt regna quae pater subiegit: Alphonso Legionem et Garciae Gallaeciam.
Patre defuncto, Sanctius bellum gessit anno 1068 contra sobrinos suos Sanctium IV Navarrae et Sanctium I Aragoniae. Hoc bellum Bellum trium Sanctiorum appellatur. Cum hoc bello, Castella incorporavit ceteras terras Navarrae. Vir clarissumus, Rodericus Didaci vel Rodericus Campidoctoris, cum Sanctio pugnavit.
Tunc, anno 1069, Sanctius cum Alphonso contra fratrem Garciam bellum gesserunt, ut regnum Gallaeciam subiegisset. Gallaecia divisa est inter Sanctium et Alphonsum. Nihilominus, anno 1072 Sanctius contra Alphonsum tandem pugnavit. Post duo proelia (in Vulpegera et in Plantata), Sanctius victor Alphonsum exilio in Toletum misit. 
Eodem anno 1072, Sanctius coronatus est rex Castellae Legionisque, sed relinquebat singulam urbem Semoram. Semora recta est ab Urraca, soror Sanctii, quae Alphonso iuvit. Sanctius Semoram obsedit, sed eques insidiosus Semorae, Belidius Athaulphi appellatur, regi mendacia finxit. Tunc cum rege circiter moenias Semorae, Belidius Sanctium trasfixit cum pilo.
Sepultus est in Oniense monasterio.

Predella ab Ioanne Faesulano eodem tempore in tribus tabulis picta hodie in Pinacotheca Nationali Britannica servatur cum duabus aliis tabulis ad pilastra predellae olim ut videtur adfixis. Opus confectum est iussu fratrum Ordinis Dominicanorum Faesulanorum (cuius Ordinis Ioannes ipse particeps fuit).

Tabula principali depinguntur virgo et infans inthronizati cum sanctis Thoma Aquinate, Barnaba, Dominico et Petro Martyre Veronensi. Ioannes Faesulanus picturam confecit post annum 1419 sed pro certo ante 1423, quo anno pictor Bicci di Lorenzo novam imaginem Virginis et Infantis, ex hac inspiratam, Emporii Tusciae pingere incepit ad sacellum Simonis da Spicchio in ecclesia collegiata Sancti Andreae. Imago Bicci iam cum illo Triptycho Sancti Iuvenalis quem Masaccio anno 1422 confecerat comparata est et cum aliis nonnullis similibus. Origo artistica omnium in hac Ioannis Faesulani pictura reperienda Anneke De Vries prima suasit.In refectione huius picturae, anno 1501 suscepta, forma tabulae necnon recessus imaginis omnino mutati sunt, sicut post reparationes anno 1972 factas e novo videri licet.

1131,"Scacci (-orum, m.pl.) sive ludus scaccorum est tabularis artis, ingenii, et stratagematis ludus. Luditur a lusoribus duobus super alveum scacchicum qui columnas octo ordinesque octo continet; hinc 64 quadrata colorum (saepissime albi nigrique) alternorum, ""aediculae,"" ""casae,"" ""quadri,"" ""quadra,"" etc., dicta. Utrique lusori est exercitus (etiam saepissime albus nigerque) seni deni militum (variis nominibus dictorum, praesertim ""orbiculi,"" ""calculi,"" ""scacci,"" vel etiam ""latrunculi""): octoni peditum, binorum turrium, binorum equitum, binorum episcoporum, singulae reginae, et singuli regis (qui saepe scacchus quoque vocatur). 
Propositum ludi est trium passuum:

Primus: Considerandum et seligendum est motum vel consilium ad melius oppugnandum ac defendendum;
Secundus: Proficiscendum est et instruendae sunt acies ad optimum consilium conficiendum;
Tertius: Redigenda est motilitas regis contrarii usque ad regem vinciendum.Quisque orbiculus potest moveri in semita praescripta, et milites hostiles capere. Regulae non permittunt ut rex capiatur: si lusor potest regem alternum capere, nonnunquam ""Scacce!,"" ""Scaccum!,"" vel ""Cave regem!"" exclamat (quod autem non est praeceptum vel vera regula). Alter lusor coactus est regem suum conservare priusquam alia facere liceat. Nisi potest servari, rex dicitur ""mattus"" esse, lusorque superatur.
Verbum ""scacci"" venit per Arabicam linguam de Persice šāh id est ""rex"", vel ""rex tuus in periculo est"". Ludus nominatur Arabice šatranj, quod venit per veterem Persicam linguam čatrang a Sanscrite čaturanga, qui dicit '[habens] quattuor artūs', et hi artus sunt quattuor partes exercitus Indici antiqui: milites, equi, currūs, elephantes; et saepe in poematis Indicis antiquis verbum ""čaturanga"" significavit 'exercitus'.


== Nomen ==
 Nomen quod est ""scacci"" diversis orthographiis scribitur, praesertim scāchi, scacchi et scāci.
 Ludus quoque dicitur ""scachicus ludus"" (a Leibnitio), ""shahiludium"" (a Thoma Hyde), scaciludium.
 Verbis classicis ludus etiam dicitur ""regius ludus,"" ""regum ludus,"" et saepissime ""latrunculi."" Ludus regibus pertinet sane eo quod Šāh lingua Persica significat regem.
 Vide et s.v. zatricium.


== Supellectiles ==
 Alveolus scachicus, qui scaccarium dici potest.
 Utrique turmae sunt sedecim ""scacci,"" seu milites. Cuique militi fere sunt saltem duo nomina quorum alterum est Latinitatis purae, alterumque nomen mediaevale quod habetur esse quasi terminus technicus ludi. In enumeratione quae sequitur, nomen purius litteris fortibus scribitur; nomen technicum, litteris fortibus et italicis. Cuique lusori sunt: 1 rex, sive scaccus
 1 regina (vel virgo, vel amazon, vel domina), sive dama (unde damicus ludus), vel fercia
 2 turres, vel elephantes, sive rochi
 2 episcopi (vel satellites, vel signiferi, vel cursores, vel sagittiferi), sive alfīni
 2 equites
 8 pedites, vel pedini, sive pedones


== Regulae et ratio ==
Varietas, difficultas, et voluptas scachorum est quod semita cuiusque militis dissimilis sit. Oppugnare simul ac defendere necesse est, et motibus omnium militum efficaciter uti oportet.


=== Motus scaccorum ===
 Rex potest moveri in omnes partes sed unum tantum quadratum.
 Adrochatio: Si nec regem nec turrim quis-quam moverit, neque rex in periculo sit, neque ulli milites sint inter regem et turrem, nec ullum quadratum per quod praetereat rex inter regem et turrim in periculo sit, rex se concelare potest se duo quadrata ad latus movendo. Turris ad latus oppositum regis movetur, quadrata duo (si in partibus regis sit) aut tria (si in partibus reginae, nempe) praeteriens.^

 Regina est potentissima omnium militum. Ei sunt potestates et episcopi et turris. Potest moveri passim quemlibet numerum quadratorum prorsum (sive sursum), rursum (sive deorsum), dextrorsum, sinistrorsum, et quemlibet in obliquum. Turris potest moveri quemlibet numerum quadratorum prorsum (sive sursum), rursum (sive deorsum), aut a latere. Episcopus unicus orbiculus est qui numquam errat a colore in quo coeperit. Potest moveri quemlibet numerum quadratorum solum in obliquum. Eques etiam unicus orbiculus est, quod solus possit moveri saliens praeter alios. Non necesse est equitem retro manere, milite in semita. Potest moveri solum in figura L in partes omnes, e.g. duo quadrata prorsum (seu sursum) et unum dextrorsum. Pedes potest moveri unum quadratum prorsum (seu sursum) solum, nisi in motu primo, in quo potest moveri duo quadrata prorsum (seu sursum). Si miles eiusdem aut alterius exercitus est obvius in semita status, pedes moveri non potest. Potest captare solum in obliquum, unum quadratum. 
 In praetereundo: Si in motu primo, pedes peditem alterius exercitus praeterit, alter potest captare in obliquum a tergo.
 Promotio: Pedes ad ordinem ultimum progressus in quemlibet militem eiusdem coloris praeter regem promovebitur.


== Historia ==


=== Formae pristinae ===

Multae se gentes Scaccorum ludi invenisse contendunt quoddam semen. Plurimi putant homines priorem Ludi regii formam ex India oriundam esse, cum nomina Arabica, Persica, Graeca, Lusitana, Hispanica scaccorum Ludi ab antiquo ludo Chaturanga appellato originem ducunt omnia. Accedit, quod temporibus praeteritis soli Indi tribus bestiis - equo, camelo, elephante - in exercitu suo vehente usi sunt, quae genera in regum ludi equite, episcopo/cursore, turri significantur. Quod nos novimus scaciludium a Chaturanga Ludi forma, qua Indi saeculo fere VI luserunt, originem duxit suam. In litteris Persicis primum ludi regii forma prior, cum nomine Chatrang, anno fere 600o memoratur, in quibus nomen factum est Shatranj. Scacci litteris mandati antiquissimi saeculo septimo facti sunt. Ad annum fere 800um ludus ad Seres pervenit et sub nomine Xiangqi mutatus est. Chaturanga ludus etiam in Iaponiam, ubi dicitur shogi, dilatus est. Shatranj autem ludus per plagas muslimicas post Persiam a Muslimicis exercitibus captam disseminatus est, quippe scaccorum nomina maxima ex parte in formis Persicis permanserunt. Shatranj nomen lingua Hispanica ajedrez lingua Graeca zatrikion perpetuatum est, plerisque autem Europae partibus Persici verbi shāh (""rex"") formae in eius locum sunt ingressae. Shatranj ad Europae partem occidentem tribus minimum viis quarum prima saeculo 9o pervenit. Ad annum millesimum ludus per Europam est disseminata.In Hiberiam a Mauris saeculo 10o inductus et in codice manu scripto libro de los juegos appellato saeculo 13o una cum Backgammon atque alea descriptus est.Secundum aliam coniecturam, cui David H. Li prae aliis favet, scaciludium a Xiangqui ludo, vel saltem a forma eius priore, quae apud Seres inde a saeculo 2o ante Chr. n. exstet, sit oriundum.


== Notatio ==

Ludi scaccorum modis nonnullis notantur quippe, at solent adnotari in notatione scaccorum algebraica; praecipue ubi homines (utrum viri an feminae) in certamen concertent. Notatio algebraica brevis motum militum in hoc modo recordatur: littera militis in motionem / columna qua stat / ordo quo stat. Littera prima maiuscula nominis militis linguae Anglicae est adhibita inter nationes ut nomina scaccorum abbrevientur, etiam in nationibus ubi inhabitantes non alphabeto Latino scribere solent. Columnae litteris a-h, ordines numeris 1-8 notantur. In quadrum a1 semper adest niger color. E.g. Qg5 indicat ""Reginam in columna g ordine quinto"". Si ludus est in progessu, et motus ipsi notantur, Qg5 indicat ut regina moverat in quadrum g5. Si duo milites eiusdem generis possint in idem quadrum movere, littera additicia notationi additur, columna ex qua miles moverat indicans. Ita Ngf3 indicat ""equitem ex columna g, movisse in f3"". Si plane est manifestum quis sit moturus in quadrum datum, nonnumquam littera omittitur. E.g. primus motus ludi saepe notatur ""e4"", quod nullus miles moveat in e4 nisi Pe2. Motus exercitus albi, cui semper est primus motus, in sinistra, nigri in dextra scribuntur.
Si miles captetur, post litteram maiusculam scacci, littera x et littera columnae in quam captatur minuscula scribenda est, e.g. Bxf3 significat 'episcopum captasse militem in f3. ' Saepe, si pedes captetur, littera columnae ex qua captaverit ante litteram ""x"", et columnae in quam captaverit, atque etiam, minuscula scribitur, e.g. exd5 significat 'peditem ex columna e captasse in d5 '.

Si pedes ad ordinem ultimum adveniat, promotio notatur littera miltis post quadrum scripta; e.g., e1Q indicat ""peditem nigrum (ita, quod ordo ultimus albo est octavus) in columna e promotum esse in reginam"". Adrochatio in partibus regis ""0-0"", reginae ""0-0-0"" notatur. Motus qui regem cavet notatur ""+"". Si rex est mattus, ""#"" vel ""++"" scribitur.

Die 10 Augusti 955, Hungaris paravit pugnando clades Lechfeldense; ob eam victoriam splendidam accepit honores plurimos Otto. Anno 962, Papa Ioanne XII Ottonem Romam vocavit: Otto donum Pippini renovavit, ut coronam Caesaris acciperet. Cum ita Imperium Sacrum Romanum conderet, Otto bene meritus est de natione Germanorum. Anno insequenti Ioannem XII e pontificatu deicere curavit. In matrimonium duxit Edgytham, Edwardi regis Anglorum filiam.

1147,"Pertanian gurun pada umumnya tergantung pada pengairan, kerana ia merupakan cara termudah untuk memekarkan gurun. Di California, Lembah Imperial merupakan contoh baik apa yang boleh dilakukan. Australia, Israel, dan Tanduk Afrika juga merupakan tempat dengan pertanian gurun yang menarik.
Satu masalah berkaitan dengan tanaman tumbuhan tradisional di gurun ialah kekurangan air tanah. Pengairan titis merupakan satu cara untuk mengurangkan jumlah air yang diperlukan. Satu lagi cara ialah dengan menanam tanaman yang sesuai dengan iklim gurun, seperti jojoba, pokok kurma dan sitrus.


== Pertanian tanpa pengairan (Gurun Sonora) ==
Orang asli Amerika di Gurun Sonora telah lama mengamalkan (dan masih mengamalkan) pertanian gurun tanpa pengairan. Ini bergantung banyak terhadap salji musim sejuk dan hujan dan corak cuaca musim tengkujuh musim panas yang melembapkan angin tropika dari Teluk Mexico ke Mexico utara dan negeri Arizona, Utah, New Mexico dan Colorado di barat daya Amerika Syarikat. Angin lembap ini, bersama dengan kepanasan matahari dari tanah, dapat menyebabkan pembentukan ribut petir yang cukup besar yang dapat membanjiri sesetengah kawasan dengan jumlah air hebat dalam masa yang singkat. Sementara permukaan tanah kering dengan cepat, dan banyak air yang mengalir ke anak sungai dan dasar sungai yang kering, banyak juga air yang diserap masuk ke lapisan tanah atas. Untuk mengambil kesempatan keadaan ini, adalah penting untuk tanaman bermula awal pada musim, di mana mereka menggunakan embun air musim sejuk dari ribut Lautan Pasifik yang berasal dari Teluk Alaska dan ribut Musim Sejuk Pasifik lain dari kawasan-kawasan tropik (""Ekspres Nanas""). Tunas awal dari biji yang ditanam (kebanyakannya kacang, labu, dan jagung) dilindungi dengan menanam dalam lubang-lubang galian yang kecil, di mana tunas-tunas ini lebih dekat dengan air musim sejuk yang tertinggal dalam tanah dan dilindungi dari fros awal musim bunga. Walaupun telah berjaya digunakan untuk suatu tempoh (kemungkinannya) sehingga 14,000 tahun, terdapat banyak kesukaran besar dengan bentuk pertanian ini sejak kemarau bermula pada 2002, dengan pemanasan sejagat disyaki menukar corak cuaca, dan dengan masalah kekurangan air tanah oleh kerana pengekstrakan untuk pertanian pengairan konvensional moden, halaman metropolitan, tujuan industri, dan talian paip batu arang (talian paip kini telah dihentikan melalui tindakan oleh pihak berkuasa Navajo).
Orang asli Amerika yang telah mengamalkan pertanian ini termasuklah Anasazi silam dan tidak lagi wujud, Hopi yang telah lama wujud, Tewa, Zuni, dan puak berdaerah yang lain, termasuk Navajo yang secara relatif baru tiba (sekitar 1400 M). Puak-puak yang pelbagai ini dicirikan pada umumnya oleh penakluk Sepanyol pada daerah itu sebagai Indian Sinagua, sinagua bermakna ""tanpa air"", walaupun istilah ini tidak digunakan untuk orang asli Amerika yang moden di daerah tersebut.
Disebabkan pergantungan besar pada cuaca, suatu unsur yang dianggap di luar kawalan manusia, banyak kepercayaan agama, upacara, dan sembahyang timbul dalam penanaman tanaman, terutamanya dalam penanaman empat jenis jagung utama, dicirikan oleh warna mereka: merah, kuning, biru dan putih. Kemunculan jagung sebagai tanda kerohanian sering dapat dilihat dalam tangan bentuk mambang ""Yeh"" yang terdapat pada tikar Navaho, dalam upacara berkaitan dengan ""Maiden Jagung"" dan Kachina lain Hopi, dan dalam pelbagai objek fetisy puak-puak kawasan itu.


== Pertanian gurun di Mesir ==
Lebih dari sedekad yang lalu, Mesir telah mensasarkan unuk menjalankan pertanian secara besar-besaran di gurun disebabkan besarnya kawasan gurun di Mesir. Bekalan air untuk pertanian gurun di Mesir kebanyakannya bergantung kepada penggalian perigi. Pengairan dilakukan dengan titisan air berbeza dengan pengairan penenggelaman yang digunakan di lembah Sungai Nil yang telah dugunakan para petani Mesir selama beribu-ribu tahun.

1148,"Experiment Farm Cottage (Kotej Ladang Percubaan), di Harris Park, New South Wales, Australia, ialah salah satu kediaman berdiri tertua di Australia. Ia terletak di tapak Ladang Percubaan, ladang Eropah yang pertama di Australia, yang ia sendiri diwujudkan oleh geran tanah pertama di Australia. Ia tersenarai sebagai warisan di peringkat negeri dan persekutuan.


== Sejarah ==
Pada tahun 1789, James Ruse telah dipilih oleh Gabenor Arthur Phillip untuk menjalankan percubaan untuk melihat berapa lama masa bagi seorang lelaki untuk menyara kehidupannya. Ruse telah diberikan satu setengah ekar (6,000 m²) tanah yang telah dibersihkan, serta bantuan untuk membersihkan tambahan lima ekar (20,000 m²). Beliau juga akan dibekalkan dengan dua ekor babi betina dewasa dan enam ekor ayam. Dia diberikan makan dan pakaian dari gedung awam selama 15 bulan, dan kemudian beliau telah menjadi berjaya berdikari dan telah diberikan tambahan 30 ekar (120,000 m²).
Pada bulan Oktober 1793, Ruse menjual ladangnya kepada pakar bedah John Harris, pembina pondok jajahan yang besar yang wujud pada hari ini. Doktor Harris ialah seorang warganegara yang terkenal di tanah jajahan yang pesat membangun, dan juga rakan-rakan dengan John and Elizabeth MacArthur dari Elizabeth Farm, satu lagi pengusaha awal pertanian yang diraikan hanya dalam jarak berjalan kaki.
Experiment Farm Cottage telah dibeli pada tahun 1961 oleh Amanah Negara Australia (NSW) dan merupakan hak milik Amanah Negara pertama di New South Wales. Ia telah dipulihkan secara menyeluruh dan kini dibuka kepada orang ramai.

Ia adalah majalah yang pertama menumpukan sepenuhnya untuk sains fiksyen. Cerita cereka sains telah membuat penampilan tetap di majalah lain, termasuk beberapa majalah yang diterbitkan oleh Gernsback, tapi Menakjubkan membantu menentukan dan melancarkan baru genre pulp fiction.

1210,"Sikit Punya Gila merupakan sebuah filem cereka komedi dan drama Melayu yang diterbitkan oleh Indra Filem Productions & Distributions Sdn. Bhd. pada tahun 1982 . Filem ini diklasifikasikan sebagai tayangan umum.
Filem ini telah diarahkan oleh Raja Ismail dan diterbitkan oleh dua orang pemilik syarikat penerbitan tersebut iaitu Zain & Zaharan.
Filem ini seakan-akan kesinambungan kepada filem Setinggan kerana menampilkan tiga orang yang pernah terlibat dalam filem tersebut, iaitu Yusni Jaafar, Ibrahim Pendek dan Tok Bomoh, tetapi kedua-dua jalan ceritanya jauh berbeza dan filem ini tidak menampilkan sebarang elemen seram yang ada dalam filem tersebut.


== Ringkasan ==
Cerita ini berkisar tentang kehidupan dua orang (Hamid dan Dharma) yang merantau dari kampung untuk mencari kekayaan di bandar.
Hamid adalah seorang penjual jagung rebus yang menggunakan basikal sorong, manakala Dharma adalah penjaga lif untuk sebuah bangunan yang menempatkan kompleks membeli-belah dan pejabat. Mereka tinggal disebuah rumah sewa kepunyaan pasangan suami isteri, Pak Ibrahim dan Kak Yusni, dan berjiran bersama dengan Nora yang bekerja sebagai Penjaga Kaunter disebuah pejabat dan Norlia yang menjadi Penjaga Tempat Letak Kereta.
Pada permulaannya, Dharma, Hamid, Nora dan Norlia tinggal berjiran dirumah sewa milik Pak Ibrahim. Walaupun perhubungan mereka baik, tetapi Dharma sesekali merasa jengkel dengan Nora dan Norlia yang dilihat sebagai mata duitan. Pak Ibrahim pula yang menjadi penyewa kepada mereka dilihat tidak berkira dengan mereka, walaupun mereka sentiasa berhutang dengan Pak Ibrahim.
Kehidupan Hamid dan Dharma yang dilanda hutang-piutang menyebabkan mereka sentiasa dirundum masalah kewangan, sehinggakan diantara mereka tidak mampu untuk membayar tambang bas. Walaupun mereka bekerja, mereka tidak berhemah dalam membelanjakan wang mereka, dan ada antaranya menghabiskan wang mereka untuk bertaruh dalam pertandingan 'Kuda Longkang' pada hujung minggu. Hamid pula kurang rajin dalam berniaga jagung rebusnya dan sehingga satu masa dia berhenti menjual, tetapi pendapatannya dilihat sering dikikis oleh Dharma yang suka mencuri harta benda Hamid secara senyap-senyap. Dharma yang menjadi penjaga lif pula kurang berdisiplin dalam pekerjaannya dan sentiasa dimarahi oleh ketuanya.
Hamid dan Dharma yang sentiasa memikirkan untuk menjadi kaya, berusaha dengan pelbagai cara yang haram disisi agama. Salah satunya adalah berjudi Kuda Longkang dan mendapatkan khidmat bomoh untuk mendapatkan empat nombor ekor, yang dihalau keluar oleh bomoh kerana enggan melayan mereka dan menasihati mereka dalam mencari kekayaan. Walaupun pada pengakhirannya mereka tetap dengan sikap buruk mereka yang suka berjudi dan nombor ekor yang mereka teka secara buah fikiran itu mengena, mereka gagal juga untuk mendapatkan habuannya dek kerana kesilapan Dharma meletak kertas nombor ekor dalam poket seragammnya yang sedang dicuci oleh pemilik kedai dobi.
Cerita ini, walaupun memberi pengajaran, ianya dikatakan komedi kerana mengandungi unsur-unsur lawak jenaka dalam setiap babak cerita tersebut, seperti babak Hamid mandi dipantai dengan berkain pelekat, Kak Yusni yang tercekik batang jagung, watak Pak Ibrahim yang miang dengan Nora dan Norlia, dan banyak lagi. Juga diselitkan babak bercanda di pantai Port Dickson diantara Nora, Norlia, Abang Kus dan Abang Yusof.


== Pelakon ==
Para pelakon dalam filem ini adalah:
1. Dharma Harun Al-Rashid sebagai Dharma.
2. Hamid Gurkha sebagai Hamid.
3. Datin Nora Shamsuddin sebagai Nora.
4. Norlia Ghani (dalam filem ditulis Norlia Ramlee) sebagai Norlia.
5. Ibrahim Pendek (Allahyarham) sebagai Pak Ibrahim.
6. Yusni Jaafar (Allahyarhamah) sebagai Kak Yusni.
7. Kuswadinata (Allahyarham) sebagai Abang Kus.
8. Dato' Yusof Haslam sebagai Abang Yusof.


== Lagu ==
Lagu yang digunakan dalam filem ini adalah lagu Sikit Punya Gila nyanyian Dharma Harun Al-Rashid dan Rohana Jalil. Lagu ini dikelolakan oleh Kassim Masdor.


== Pencapaian ==
Filem ini telah dinobatkan sebagai Filem Komedi Terbaik melalui Raja Ismail sebagai pengarah dan Pelawak Terbaik yang disandang oleh Hamid Gurkha di Pesta Filem Malaysia ke-3 pada tahun 1982.

1236,"Apple III (1980) ialah sebuah komputer peribadi yang direka sebagai pengganti kepada Apple II oleh Apple Computer Inc. tetapi kurang berjaya. Disasarkan pada para pengguna perniagaan, ia dijual dari bulan Mei 1980 sehingga ditamatkan pada tahun 1984. Kerja reka bentuk dimulakan pada akhir tahun 1978 di bawah bimbingan Dr. Wendell Sander.


== Ciri Apple III ==
Apple III menonjolkan SOS (Sophisticated Operating System, iaitu Sistem Pengendalian Canggih), sebuah sistem pengendalian yang maju, dan ""Apple III BASIC Perniagaan"", sebuah pentafsir BASIC. UCSD Pascal juga dibekalkan untuk membolehkan pengaturcaraan yang lebih berstruktur. Ciri-cirinya yang lain termasuk:

paparan 80-lajur, dengan huruf besar serta huruf kecil;
pad kekunci angka;
sokongan untuk jam masa nyata;
audio 6-bit (DAC);
grafik 16-warna;
sistem fail berhierarki;
keupayaan untuk melagak komputer Apple II+ 48 KB; dan
pemacu cakera liut 5.25"" 140 KB terbina, dengan sehingga tiga buah Cakera III, iaitu pemacu cakera liut luaran.
Apple III dikuasai oleh SynerTek 6502A, sebuah unit pemprosesan pusat (CPU) 8-bit 2-MHz. Sebagaimana dengan sesetengah mesin yang lebih maju dalam keluarga Apple II, ia menggunakan teknik pensuisan bank untuk mengalamatkan ingatan sehingga 256 KB (512 KB melalui peningkatan perisian pihak ketiga). Apple III ialah keluaran Apple yang pertama yang membenarkan penggunanya memilih kedua-dua fon skrin serta bentangan papan kekunci (sama ada QWERTY atau Dvorak).


== Punca kegagalan dalam pasaran ==
Apple III mengalami kegagalan dalam pasaran, akibat berbagai-bagai alasan seperti yang berikut:
Dengan harga permulaan sebanyak sekitar AS$3,500, ia adalah lebih mahal daripada banyak komputer perniagaan berasaskan CP/M yang dijual ketika itu.
Perpustakaan perisian Apple III amat terhad.
Mesin itu mempunyai banyak pepijat perkakasan dan perisian. Sebagai contoh, jam masa nyata yang merupakan jamnya yang pertama di dalam sebuah komputer Apple, akan gagal selepas digunakan untuk masa yang panjang. Akhirnya, syarikat Apple memilih untuk menghapuskan jam tersebut sama sekali daripada spesifikasinya.
Apple III tidak memiliki kipas pendinginan (suatu cadangan Steve Jobs untuk mencapai prestasi yang lebih sunyi, akan tetapi ia akhirnya mengakibatkan banyak kekandasan dan masalah) serta liang udara. Akibatnya, Apple terpaksa menggantikan 14,000 buah mesinnya yang pertama secara percuma.


== Apple III Plus ==
Apple III Plus, versi yang diperbaik, diperkenalkan pada bulan Disember 1983. Bagaimanapun, kempen ""Biarkan Saya Memperkenalkan Saya Semula"" yang baharu itu tidak dapat menyelamatkan reputasi Apple III yang buruk. Mungkin lebih berkait dalam jangka masa panjang adalah fakta bahawa Apple III pada dasarnya merupakan sebuah komputer Apple II tertingkat — pengganti terbaharu kepada barisan mesin 8-bit yang telah wujud sejak dari tahun 1976.
Pada tahun selepas Apple III diperkenalkan, IBM melancarkan komputer peribadinya yang merupakan sebuah reka bentuk 16-bit yang benar-benar baharu. Berbagai-bagai klonnya yang murah juga turut dijual. Pasaran perniagaan bergerak dengan pantas ke mesin IBM serta klonnya dan pada bulan September 1985, barisan Apple III ditamatkan setelah menjual sekitar 65,000 unit. Steve Wozniak, pengasas bersama Apple, menyatakan bahawa alasan utama bagi kegagalan Apple III adalah bahawa sistem itu direka bentuk oleh bahagian pemasaran Apple, berbeza dengan projek-projek sebelumnya yang didorong oleh bahagian kejuruteraan Apple.

1268,"Komputer peribadi ialah komputer yang sesuai digunakan untuk kegunaan peribadi. Komputer jenis ini boleh didapati di pasaran dengan harga yang pelbagai—bergantung kepada kehendak pengguna, tetapi amat rendah jika dibandingkan dengan komputer berkuasa tinggi seperti superkomputer.
Komputer peribadi juga digunakan untuk merujuk kepada komputer komputer peribadi IBM (IBM Personal Computer) keluaran IBM. Komputer ini merupakan pencetus kepada perkembangan komputer peribadi sehingga ke hari ini.
Komputer peribadi boleh dikelaskan kepada beberapa kategori mengikut rupa dan saiz:
Komputer meja
Komputer riba
Komputer tablet
Pembantu digital peribadi atau PDA
Komputer boleh alih
Komputer boleh pakai
Telefon bimbit


== Sejarah ==
Komputer peribadi ialah mikrokomputer yang berharga rendah. Pada asalnya direkabentuk supaya ia hanya boleh diguna oleh seorang pada satu masa, dan juga serasi IBM PC.
Nadi utama bagi mikrokomputer ialah Unit Pemprosesan Pusat mikropemproses (microprocesor CPU). Mikropemproses yang pertama ialah Intel4004 yang dikeluarkan pada 15 November 1971. Generasi pertama mikrokomputer yang mula dikeluarkan pada tahun 70an. Namun begitu, ia berprestasi lebih rendah, dan kurang upaya berbanding dengan komputer perniagaan pada waktu itu. Ia hanya diguna oleh peminat komputer, atau hanya untuk permainan elektronik.
Mikrokomputer menjadi alat perniagaan apabila atur cara hamparan elektronik VisiCalc dilancarkan untuk mesin Apple II, dan seterusnya untuk IBM PC. Pada sekitar tahun 1980-an, harga komputer peribadi yang rendah menjadi sebab utama kepopularannya untuk kegunaan di rumah serta perniagaan. Pada tahun 1982, majalah Times memberikan Komputer Peribadi gelaran ""Man of the Year"".
Menjelang tahun 1990an, kuasa prestasi Komputer Peribadi meningkat secara drastik, sehingga ia hampir menyamai kuasa komputer pelbagai pengguna, seperti Mainframe. Pada hari ini, komputer tahap tinggi (higher-end computer) lebih kerap membezakan dengan komputer peribadi dari segi kestabilan serta kuasa multitasking yang lebih baik, daripada hanya bergantung semata-mata pada kuasa CPU.


== Seni bina dan kad tambah ==
Kebanyakan Komputer Peribadi moden menggunakan senibina perkakasan yang serasi dengan komputer peribadi IBM, dan menggunakan pemproses berciri x86 yang dikeluarkan oleh Intel, AMD, atau Cyrix. Keupayaan komputer peribadi boleh ditingkatkan lagi dengan penggunaan kad tambah.


== Komputer peribadi tak serasi IBM ==
Di sebalik kepopularan komputer peribadi, terdapat juga sejumlah komputer peribadi yang tidak serasi dengan IBM yang masih menjadi tarikan pengguna. Salah satu daripadanya ialah Power Macintosh yang dikeluarkan oleh Apple Computer. Komputer peribadi itu yang mempergunakan seni bina PowerPC digunakan secara meluas dalam bidang seni bina grafik serta multimedia.
Di samping itu, terdapat juga komputer peribadi lain yang bukan-bersesuaian dengan IBM:
Amiga
Archimedes & RiscPC

Bagi pengisian minyak ke helikopter, ia dikenali sebagai ""HIFR"" (Helicopter In Flight Refueling). Prosedur ini membolehkan pesawat penerima untuk kekal berada di ruang udara untuk jangka masa yang lebih lama, dan yang lebih penting adalah kemampuan untuk meningkatkan jarak operasi. Kekerapan dan had pengisian minyak di udara bergantung pada kelesuan anak kapal pesawat dan faktor-faktor kejuruteraan seperti penggunaan minyak enjin.
Oleh kerana pesawat penerima boleh diisi dengan bahan api tambahan semasa di udara, sesebuah pesawat dapat berlepas dengan beban muatan yang lebih tinggi seperti tambahan persenjataan, kargo atau anggota tentera: berat berlepas maksimum boleh dicapai dengan mengimbangi beban muatan dengan jumlah berat bahan api yang kurang. Kelebihan lain ialah landasan yang lebih pendek boleh digunakan akibat berat berlepas yang ringan sebelum melakukan pengisian minyak di udara (seperti pesawat pengawasan SR-71 Blackbird milik A.S.)",ms,Pesawat penangki minyak,https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesawat_penangki_minyak

Harris telah mencipta banyak siri TV termasuklah: Fay, Soap, Loves Me, Loves Me Not, Benson, It Takes Two, The Golden Girls, Empty Nest, Nurses, Good & Evil, The Golden Palace dan The Secret Lives of Men. Beliau turut menulis (dan menulis bersama) untuk kesemua episod Soap. The Golden Girls menjadi rancangan beliau yang paling berjaya.
Skrip pertama Harris yang terjual adalah Then Came Bronson. Beliau kemudiannya menulis untuk Love, American Style, All in the Family, The Partridge Family dan Barefoot in the Park.
Harris pernah mengahwini pelakon Berkeley Harris pada tahun 1965 sehingga 1969, dan dikurniakan seorang anak Sam Harris. Pada 18 September 1983, Harris mengahwini penerbit TV, Paul Junger Witt. Witt juga merupakan penerbit bersama untuk kesemua rancangan yang diterbitkannya.
Harris mengalami gejala sindrom keletihan yang teruk, yang menjejaskan keupayaannya untuk terlibat dalam penghasilan The Golden Girls. Menerusi episod ""Sick and Tired"" (1989), Harris menulis jalan cerita yang menceritakan kepayahan yang dihadapi beliau disebabkan oleh sindrom ini menerusi watak Dorothy Zbornak (lakonan Bea Arthur). Ia kemudiannya diketahui bahawa Harris mempunyai masalah adrenal, namun beliau menulis episod itu sebagai ""skrip balas dendam saya untuk semua orang di luar sana yang mempunyai penyakit seperti itu.""

Sumber-sumber lebih reliable mengtafsirkan bahawa Katolik Rumi adalah 95-98% dari jumlah penduduk, bermakna peratusan Muslim mungkin lebih kurang dari 14%.


== Sejarah ==
Islam dipercayai telah diperkenalkan ke Malta apabila oran Muslim dari Afrika Utara menyerb dan menangkapnya dari Byzantine Romans pada 870.  Orang Byzantine cuba hendak menangkap kembali pulau-pulau Malta ini tetapi tidak berjaya. Malta akhirnya jatuh ke tangan Kristian Eropah ketika Penaklukan Normannya pada 1091. Walaupun setelah taklukan Norman, orang Muslim dibenarkan untuk mengamalkan agama mereka sehingga abad ke-13, sedangkan pihak Norman tidak memaksa mereka semua untuk masuk agama Kristian.

1317,"Nevado del Huila, setinggi 5,365 metre (17,602 ft), merupakan gunung berapi tertinggi di Colombia, terletak di Bahagian Huila. Sudah bertahun-tahun, jumlah salji pada gunung berapi berkenaan semakin berkurangan. Selepas pendam lebih dari 500 tahun, gunung berapi berkenaan telah menunjukkan tanda-tanda aktiviti yang jelas mulai tahun 2007. Sehingga 20 Februari 2007, terdapat lebih daripada 7000 kejadian seismos ""kecil"", dan satu amaran telah dikeluarkan di bahagian Cauca, Huila, Caldas dan Valle del Cauca. Sebarang letusan akan menjejaskan perkampungan-perkampungan kecil di sekitar gunung tersebut, terutamanya Paez, Cauca, yang penduduknya masih lagi mengingati letusan gunung berapi Nevado del Ruiz dan kemusnahan Armero.


== Letusan 2007 ==
Pada 18 April 2007, gunung berapi ini meletus dua kali dan biarpun tiada pengaliran lahar (cuma lumpur dan selut) menyebabkan runtuhan ke Sungai Paez; ini menyebabkan paras air meningkat di sepanjang Sungai Magdalena. Kira-kira 4,000 orang terpaksa dipindahkan namun tiada yang terkorban.


== Aktiviti dan letusan 2008 ==
Nevado del Huila telah menjadi aktif semula di dalam bulan Mac 2008. Selepas beberapa gempa bumi di dalam gunung berapi berkenaan, pihak berkuasa Colombia telah mengisytiharkan isyarat kecemasan lampu kuning pada 18 Mac. Isyarat kecemasan telah dinaikkan ke lampu jingga pada 29 Mac, bermakna satu letusan boleh dijangka bila-bila masa berkemungkinan dalam tempoh beberapa hari atau beberapa minggu. Ratusan penduduk telah dipindahkan. Pada 14 April 2008 iaitu pada 11:08 malam, satu letusan abu gunung berapi telah berlaku, menyebabkan kerajaan telah mengeluarkan isyarat lampu merah dan memindahkan 13,000 hingga 15,000 penduduk dari sekitar gunung itu. Keadaan isyarat lampu merah telah diturunkan ke lampu jingga pada 16 April berikutan tamatnya aktiviti berkenaan.


=== Letusan November 2008 ===
Pada 21 November 2008, gunung berapi tersebut meletus pada pukul 0245 GMT menurut Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining(Institut Geologi dan Perlombongan Colombia). BBC news melaporkan bahawa beberapa orang masih hilang dan bantuan kecemasan tidak dapat dihulurkan ke kawasan-kawasan terpencil. Pada November 23, 2008, pihak berkuasa Colombia melaporkan 10 kematian, dengan 12,000 penduduk berhampiran telah dipindahkan.  Letusan tersebut mengakibatkan runtuhan salji dan serpihan-serpihan batu yang merosakkan rumah, jambatan dan hasil tanaman. Tiga pekan kecil iaitu Paicol, La Plata dan Belalcázar merupakan antara kawasan yayng terlibat dalam kejadian ini.
Presiden Colombia Alvaro Uribe bergegas ke tempat kejadian selepas gunung berapi itu meletus. Kewujudan sistem kebangsaan yang sedia ada dalam menangani dan menghadapi malapetaka  seperti latihan kepada penduduk tempatan di kawasan yang berisiko tinggi dan juga pemasangan sistem penggera di pekan-pekan berdekatan dilaporkan berjaya mengurangkan jumlah kematian. Presiden Alvaro Uribe mengarahkan Tentera Udara Colombia supaya mewujudkan ""jambatan udara"" bagi menyalurkan bantuan ke kawasan-kawasan yang ditenggelami air di sepanjang Rio Paez.

Selepas memegang jawatan-jawatan utama di wilayah Mesir, Appian kembali ke Rom pada tahun kira-kira 120 untuk menjadi peguambela dan membela kes-kes di hadapan maharaja-maharaja. Pada paling awal tahun 147, beliau dilantik sebagai peguam cara, mungkin di Mesir, selepas diperakukan oleh seorang kawannya, Marcus Cornelius Fronto. Jawatan peguam cara hanya terbuka kepada ahli-ahli kelas menunggang kuda.
Karya Appian (Ῥωμαικα, dikenali dalam bahasa Melayu sebagai Sejarah Rom) yang terdiri daripada dua empat buah buku yang ditulis dalam bahasa Greek sebelum 165, merupakan sekumpulan mongraf, berbanding sebuah sejarah yang bersepadu. Karya ini memberikan pemerian terhadap pelbagai orang dan negara dari masa-masa terawal sehingga penubuhan empayar Rom, dan kekal dalam bentuk buku yang lengkap seperti cebisan yang besar. Walaupun gaya penulisannya tidak menarik, karya ini amat bernilai, khususnya bagi tempoh perang-perang saudara.

1345,"Heckler & Koch MK23 Mod 0 adalah sepucuk pistol serangan yang mempunyai sistem separa-automatik, dan boleh dilengkapi dengan pejera modul laser (LAM), dan pelenyap bunyi. Ia telah dijadikan pistol utama Pasukan Operasi Khas Amerika Syarikat (United States Special Operations Command, USSOCOM) untuk tugas unit operasi khas pada 1990an.
Semasa permohonan rekabentuk sistem ini siap, ia juga digunakan pada amnya dalam merujuk kepada komponen pistol tersebut. Pistol ini, menggunakan kaliber peluru berukuran .45 ACP, direkacipta oleh Heckler & Koch, dan telah dipilih dalam Colt OHWS melalui program Sistem Persenjataan Pistol Serangan USSOCOM atau Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS). Pejera LAM dan pelenyap bunyi direkacipta oleh Insight Technology dan Knight's Armament Company (KAC).


== Pengenalan ==
MK23 Mod 0 direka sebagai senjata serangan untuk pasukan elit Amerika Syarikat dibawah USSOCOM, atas permintaan pasukan itu pada tahun 1989 dan menyertai persaingan dengan Colt untuk OHWS - Offensive Handgun Weapon System - pistol ofensif pertama untuk tentera Amerika sejak penerimaan persenjataan utama Colt M1911 Govt. Versi ketenteraan pada senjata mempunyai lakaran ""MK23 USSOCOM"" yang dilakar pada slide pistol tersebut.
MK23 ini dikira sebagai pistol berkualiti tinggi, dan mampu menjadikan menembak gugusan 2 inci pada jarak 50 ela, atau secara kasarnya 4 MOA. Rekacipta ini dimulakan pada tahun 1991, dan menjadi asas kepada penciptaan pistol USP, pada tahun 1993. MK23 mempunyai ketahanan berkecuali dalam persekitaran yang amat kasar, seperti kalis air dan tahan karat. Dengan menggunakan rekabentuk laras hexagon, yang boleh memperbaiki kelasakan dan ketepatan pistol tersebut. Juga turut didatangkan dengan kekunci dwicekatan iaitu kunci yang boleh digunakan dengan kedua-dua belah tangan dan dan pelepas kelopak dikedua-dua sisi pemegang. Pelepas kelopak ini berada di bahagian pinggir belakang trigger guard. Suis pelepas picu diletakkan di sebelah kiri sisi, yang akan mengurangkan bunyi pengetuk senjata sebaik sahaja picu ditarik. MK23 milik tentera laut Amerika ada dilengkapi dengan peralatan sokongan tempur seperti pejera modul laser, pelenyap bunyi, dan lain-lain peralatan termasuklah peluru khas bertekanan tinggi (amunisi .45 +P).
Senjata ini telah diuji kemampuannya dan mampu menembak sebanyak 10, 000 butir peluru tanpa penukaran laras. Dengan kemampuan yang ada pada senjata tersebut, ia menjadi pilihan utama pasukan elit. Peluru .45 ACP mempunyai mempunyai kuasa membunuh yang paling tinggi (stopping power), dan menahan kuasa tersebut apabila dipasang penahan.
Walaubagaimanapun, senjata yang mempunyai saiz dan berat sederhana ini mempunyai keputusan kritikal. Hasilnya, HK merekacipta pistol USP Tactical merupakan versi asal USP; USP Tactical mempertunjukkan kemampuan seperti MK23 tanpa saiz besar, dan mampu menggunakan alat pelenyap bunyi tanpa penggunaan LAM. Selain itu terdapat versi kompak pada pistol USP Tactical untuk unit anti pengganas dan pasukan elit dikenali sebagai USP Compact Tactical, yang mempunyai pejera LAM dwi pilihan. USP-CT ini amat ringan dan mampu dilengkapi dengan pelenyap bunyi, menjadikan ia pilihan utama pasukan elit dalam operasi covert.
Dengan pengemukakan cadangan terhadap Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) telah mencadangkan untuk menerima gred tinggi dan amunisi +P pada senjata tersebut. Walaubagaimanapun, ia tidak akan berhasil sekiranya JCP, melekakan Program Tempur Pasukan Operasi Khas atau SOF Combat Program, sama ada akan meneruskan penggunaannya atau menggantikan MK23 dengan versi yang lain. Pada tahun 2006, JCP telah ditubuhkan dan di strukturkan semula.


== Sistem Persenjataan Pistol Serangan ==
Program MK23 diserahkan kepada USSOCOM Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) selepas memenangi kontrak pada tahun 1991 yang membawa kepada penciptaan model pistol yang berkemampuan jauh setanding dengan senjata berlaras panjang seperti submesingan dengan peralatan sokongan tempur. Ia turut menjadi saingan kepada Colt OHWS. Rekabentuk Heckler & Koch dan Colt direkabentuk bagi memenuhi permintaan terhadap keperluan OHWS, MK23 berjaya disiapkan.
HK memasarkan sistem MK23 secara komersil dan yang diperoleh, tetapi sistem SOCOM tidak dapat disiapkan. Alat pelenyap bunyi dicipta oleh Knight's Armament Company, dan menjadi pilihan utama HK. Insight Technology memenangi kontrak untuk mencipta pejera panduan laser, misalnya AN/PEQ-6. Versi pertama LAM merangkumi pejera titik cahaya nyata (visible light dot), yang mana membawa kepada rekacipta pejera inframerah yang hanya boleh digunakan dengan alat pandang malam. Oleh itu banyak perbezaan antara model LAM dengan alat pelenyap bunyi.
Model MK23 telah dihantar kepada SOCOM pada 1 Mei, 1996. Di akhir tahun, sebanyak 1,986 model telah dibangunkan (nombor siri 23-0101 melalui 23-2086).


== MK23 bagi pihak awam ==
Heckler & Koch telah menawarkan MK23 kepada pasaran awam sebagai MK23. Ia telah diuruskan secara subsidi oleh Heckler & Koch Inc., Amerika Syarikat) dan ibu pejabat utamanya Heckler & Koch GmbH, Jerman.
Model untuk pasaran Amerika di datangkan dengan kelopak berkapasiti 10-butir peluru, dengan mematuhi peruntukkan Pengharaman Senjata Tempur Amerika. Sekarang pengharaman ini telah tamat, dan MK23 bagi pihak awam didatangkan dengan kelopak berkapasiti 12-butir sebagai versi kerajaan. Di Kanada, pistol MK23 masih menggunakan kelopak berkapasiti 10-butir peluru, sebagai mematuhi Akta Senjatapi Kanada 1995.
Mengikut Operators Manual, terdapat perbezaan ketara berkaitan antara senjata awam MK23 dan senjata MK23 bagi pihak kerajaan. Perbezaannya terdapat pada lakaran slide senjata (""MK23"" gantinama kepada ""MK23 USSOCOM"") dan laras senjata menjurus kepada spesifikasi tertinggi Institut Pengeluaran Amunisi dan Senjata Sukan (SAAMI).

1381,"Roekiah (Ejaan yang Disempurnakan: Rukiah; lahir 1917 - meninggal dunia 2 September 1945), sering dikreditkan sebagai Miss Roekiah, ialah seorang penyanyi keroncong dan pelakon filem Indonesia. Anak perempuan kepada dua penghibur pentas, beliau memulakan kerjaya pada usia tujuh tahun; menjelang 1932 beliau menjadi terkenal di Batavia, Hindia Timur Belanda (kini Jakarta, Indonesia), sebagai penyanyi dan pelakon pentas. Pada masa ini beliau bertemu Kartolo, yang dikahwininya pada tahun 1934. Kedua-dua berlakon dalam filem 1937 Terang Boelan, di mana Roekiah dan Rd Mochtar memgang watak pencinta muda.
Selepas kejayaan komersial filem itu, Roekiah, Kartolo, dan sebahagian besar pelakon dan krew Terang Boelan telah menandatangani untuk Tan's Film, pertama mewakili syarikat dalam penerbitan 1938 mereka Fatima. Mereka berlakon bersama-sama dalam dua filem lagi sebelum Mochtar meninggalkan syarikat itu pada tahun 1940; melalui filem-filem ini, Roekiah dan Mochtar menjadi pasangan skrin pertama jajahan. penggantian Mochtar, Rd Djoemala, berlakon dengan Roekiah dalam empat filem, walaupun kurang berjaya. Selepas Jepun menyerang Hindia pada tahun 1942, Roekiah hanya mengambil satu lagi filem peranan sebelum kematiannya; sebahagian besar waktunya digunakan bagi menghiburkan tentera Jepun.
Semasa hayatnya Roekiah ialah ikon fesyen dan kecantikan serta menampilkan dalam iklan dan perbandingan lukisan untuk Dorothy Lamour dan Janet Gaynor. Walaupun kebanyakan filem-filem di mana beliau membintanginya kini hilang, beliau terus dinamakan perintis filem dan artikel 1969 menyatakan bahawa ""dalam masa beliau [Roekiah] mencapai tahap populariti yang, seseorang itu boleh mengatakan, tidak dilihat sejak itu"". Daripada lima orang anaknya dengan Kartolo, satu - Rachmat Kartolo - memasuki bidang lakonan.


== Biografi ==


=== Kehidupan awal ===
Roekiah dilahirkan di Bandoeng (kini dikenali sebagai Bandung), Jawa Barat, Hindia Belanda, pada tahun 1917 kepada Mohammad Ali dan Ningsih, pelakon dengan kumpulan Opera Poesi Indra Bangsawan; Ali berasal dari Belitung, manakala Ningsih dari keturunan Sunda dan datang dari Cianjur. Walaupun Roekiah belajar berlakon terutamanya daripada ibu bapanya, beliau juga turut mempelajari kraf dengan ahli-ahli kumpulan mereka. Ketiga-tiga mereka sentiasa membuat rombongan, meninggalkan Roekiah dengan tiada masa untuk pendidikan formal. Menjelang pertengahan tahun 1920-an mereka dengan kumpulan lain, Rochani Opera.
Roekiah berkeras menjadi seorang pelakon, walaupun bantahan daripada keluarganya, dan meminta beliau untuk kebenaran untuk menghibur di atas pentas. Ningsih bersetuju, dengan satu syarat Roekiah hanya boleh berlakon sekali. Apabila Roekiah berusia tujuh tahun itu mengambil ke pentas untuk kali pertama, Mohammad Ali - menyedari perjanjian antara isteri dan anak perempuannya - bergegas di atas pentas dan menegaskan bahawa Roekiah berhenti menyanyi. Selepas itu, dia tidak mahu makan sehingga ibu bapanya akhirnya mengalah. Roekiah mempersembahkan secara berkala selepas itu dengan rombongan.
Menjelang 1932, tahun beliau menyertai Palestina Opera di Batavia (sekarang Jakarta), Roekiah telah menjadi seorang pelakon pentas yang terkenal dan penyanyi muzik keroncong (muzik tradisional dengan pengaruh Portugis). Roekiah dikagumi bukan sahaja untuk suaranya, tetapi kecantikannya. Walaupun dengan Palestina beliau bertemu Kartolo, seorang pelakon, pemain piano, dan penulis lagu dengan rombongan; mereka berkahwin pada tahun yang sama. Pasangan baru tidak lama lagi meninggalkan Palestina, kemudian mengambil cuti selama sebulan sebelum menyertai kumpulan Faroka pada jelajah di Singapura. Mereka kembali ke Hindia pada tahun 1936.


=== Kerjaya filem ===


==== Kerjasama bersama Rd Mochtar ====

Pada tahun 1937 Roekiah membuat penampilan filem pertamanya sebagai wanita yang utama dalam filem Albert Balink, Terang Boelan. Beliau bersama Rd Mochtar  memegang watak dua kekasih yang lari dengan kekasih supaya watak Roekiah tidak perlu berkahwin dengan seorang penyeludup candu; Kartolo juga mempunyai peranan yang kecil. Filem ini merupakan satu kejayaan komersial, pendapatan lebih 200,000 Dolar Selat semasa keluaran antarabangsanya; Sejarawan filem Indonesia Misbach Yusa Biran mengreditkan Roekiah sebagai ""dinamit"" yang membawa kepada penerimaan positif ini.
Di sebalik kejayaan Terang Boelan, syarikat penerbitannya Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat menghentikan semua kerja-kerja filem cereka. Kini menganggur dan tertekan selepas kematian ibunya, menurut wartawan W. Imong, Roekiah ""berdiam diri, sentiasa renungan seolah-olah dia mental terganggu"". Dalam usaha untuk mengalihkan perhatian isterinya, Kartolo berkumpul para pelakon lain dari Terang Boelan dan menubuhkan rombongan Terang Boelan, yang melawat ke Singapura untuk pujian popular; ini merebut Roekiah daripada kemurungan beliau. Selepas kumpulan itu kembali ke Hindia, kebanyakan pelakon yang beralih kepada Tan's Film, termasuk Roekiah dan Kartolo; kedua-dua juga beraksi dengan kumpulan keroncong Lief Java.
Bersama Tan 's Film, para pelakon Terang Boelan berperanan dalam filem berjaya Fatima pada tahun 1938, yang dibintangi oleh Roekiah dan Rd Mochtar. Dalam filem ini, Roekiah memainkan peranan utama - seorang gadis muda yang menolak rayuan seorang ketua kumpulan kerana jatuh cinta pada seorang nelayan (Rd Mochtar). Fatima secara teliti mengikuti pola penerbitan yang diterapkan pada Terang Boelan. Lakonan Roekiah dalam filem ini dipuji secara meluas. Salah seorang pengulas dari Het Nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië menulis bahawa ""lakonan Roekiah yang sederhana mengenai ketidakadilan dalam pernikahan adat Melayu walaupun telah memikat para penonton Eropah"", sedangkan pengulas lain dari Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad menyatakan bahawa penampilan Roekiah dihargai oleh semua orang.
Fatima meraih kejayaan besar secara komersial; dengan anggaran 7.000 gulden, filem ini berjaya meraih 200,000 gulden. Selepas kejayaan filem ini, Tan's terus menggandingkan Roekiah dan Rd Mochtar dalam filem-filemnya. Mereka berdua menjadi pasangan selebriti layar lebar pertama di Hindia Belanda, dan dibandingkan dengan Charles Farrell-Janet Gaynor Indonesia. Kepopularan Roekiah-Rd Mochtar sebagai pasangan layar lebar menyebabkan studio-studio lain mengikuti jejak Tan's dengan membentuk pasangan romantis ciptaan mereka sendiri. The Teng Chun misalnya, menggandingkan Mohamad Mochtar dan Hadidjah dalam filem Alang-Alang pada tahun 1939.
Untuk mengekalkan bintang baru mereka, Tan's Film menghabiskan wang dalam jumlah yang besar. Roekiah dan Kartolo menerima gaji bulanan sebanyak 150 dan 50 gulden masing-masingnya, dua kali lebih besar daripada penghormatan yang mereka terima semasa berlakon dalam Terang Boelan. Mereka berdua juga diberi sebuah rumah di Tanah Rendah, Batavia. Roekiah dan Kartolo terus berlakon dalam filem-filem produksi Tan's; Kartolo sering diberi peranan-peranan kecil dan komedi, sedangkan Roekiah menyanyikan lagu-lagu yang ditulis oleh suaminya. Pada tahun 1939, mereka berlakon filem bersama, dengan Rd Mochtar sebagai pasangannya, Gagak Item yang diilhamkan daripada cerita Zorro. Walaupun tidak sehebat filem-filem sebelum ini, filem ini masih menguntungkan. Seorang pengulas dari Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad memuji lakonan Roekiah yang ""bersungguh-sungguh""
Filem terakhir Roekiah bersama Rd Mochtar adalah Siti Akbari, yang dikeluarkan pada tahun 1940. Cerita filem ini kemungkinan diinspirasikan dari syair berjudul sama karya Lie Kim Hok, dan menampilkan Roekiah sebagai pelakon utama. Filemnya sendiri mengisahkan mengenai seorang isteri teraniaya yang tetap setia kepada suaminya walaupun ia telah berselingkuh. Siti Akbari diterima dengan baik, memperoleh pendapatan sebanyak 1.000 gulden pada malam pertama tayangannya di Surabaya, walaupun pada akhirnya tidak berjaya mengaut keuntungan yang setara dengan Terang Boelan atau Fatima.


==== Kerjasama bersama Djoemala ====

Ditengah-tengah perselisihan mengenai gaji, Rd Mochtar keluar dari Tan's Film dan bergabung dengan pesaingnya, Populair Films, pada tahun 1940. Oleh sebab itu, Tan's mula mencari pasangan baru untuk Roekiah. Kartolo meminta seorang kenalannya, pengusaha jahitan bernama Ismail Djoemala, untuk menjadi pasangan baru bagi Roekiah. Walaupun Djoemala tidak pernah berlakon sebelumnya, ia telah menyanyi bersama kumpulan Malay Pemoeda pada tahun 1929. Setelah Kartolo memintanya enam kali, Djoemala akhirnya bersetuju. Syarikat menganggap bahawa Djoemala yang rupawan dan memiliki susuk tinggi adalah pengganti yang sesuai, dan mengupahnya dengan nama pentas Djoemala.
Roekiah dan Djoemala pertama kali berlakon dalam filem Sorga Ka Toedjoe pada akhir 1940. Dalam filem ini, Roekiah berperanan sebagai seorang gadis muda yang dengan bantuan kekasihnya mampu menyatukan kembali makciknya yang buta (Annie Landouw) dengan suaminya (Kartolo) setelah bertahun-tahun berpisah. Seperti filem-filem sebelum ini, filem ini juga berjaya secara komersial  dengan ulasan yang positif. Soerabaijasch Handelsblad berpendapat bahawa Djoemala berlakon dengan baik, jika tidak lebih baik daripada Rd Mochtar.  Kajian lain di Singapore Free Press menulis bahawa ""Roekiah memainkan peranan pahlawan wanita dalam cara yang paling terpuji"".  Pada April tahun berikutnya, Tan's menerbitkan Roekihati, dibintangi oleh Roekiah yang berperanan sebagai gadis muda yang pergi ke bandar demi mencari wang untuk keluarganya yang melarat, dan akhirnya berkahwin. Penampilannya dalam filem ini dipuji oleh Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad, yang menulis bahawa ia berhasil dengan baik melakonkan peranan yang sukar.
Pada tahun 1941, Roekiah dan Djoemala melengkapkan Poesaka Terpendam, filem aksi yang mengisahkan mengenai dua kumpulan - ahli waris yang sah (termasuk Roekiah) dan segerombolan penjahat - yang berlumba-lumba mencari harta karun terpendam di Banten. Roekiah dan Djoemala kali terakhir berlakon bersama dalam filem Koeda Sembrani pada awal 1942. Dalam filem tersebut, yang diadaptasi dari Kisah Seribu Satu Malam, Roekiah berperanan sebagai Putri Shams al-Nahar yang menunggang seekor kuda terbang. Filem ini masih belum disiapkan ketika Jepun menduduki Hindia Belanda pada bulan Mac 1942,  dan baru ditayangkan pada bulan Oktober 1943.
Secara keseluruhan, Roekiah dan Djoemala telah berlakon dalam empat filem dalam dua tahun. Biran berpendapat hal ini membuktikan bahawa Tan's Film telah ""mensia-siakan hartanya"",  kerana pesaingnya memanfaatkan bintang-bintangnya untuk berlakon dalam lebih banyak filem; Java Industrial Film misalnya, pada tahun 1941 saja  mampu menghasilkan enam filem yang dibintangi oleh Moh. Mochtar. Walaupun terus berjaya secara komersial, filem-filem tersebut masih belum mampu menjana keuntungan sebanyak yang dihasilkan oleh filem-filem Roekiah sebelumnya.


=== Pendudukan Jepun dan kematian ===
Penerbitan filem di Hindia merosot selepas pendudukan Jepun bermula pada awal 1942; yang memaksa semua tetapi satu studio untuk ditutup. Di tempat mereka, Jepun membuka studio sendiri di Hindia, Nippon Eigasha, untuk menghasilkan propaganda untuk usaha perang. Kartolo berlakon dalam satu-satunya filem studio, Berdjoang, tanpa Roekiah pada tahun 1943. Selepas terhenti selama beberapa tahun,  Roekiah juga berlakon untuk studio, mengambil peranan dalam filem pendek propaganda Jepun Ke Seberang pada tahun 1944. Walau bagaimanapun, banyak masa beliau dihabiskan dengan jelajah Jawa dengan syarikat teater, menghiburkan tentera Jepun.
Roekiah jatuh sakit pada bulan Februari 1945, tidak lama selepas menamatkan Ke Seberang. Walaupun begitu, dan keguguran, beliau tidak dapat untuk berehat; tentera Jepun menegaskan bahawa beliau dan Kartolo pergi melawat ke Surabaya, di Jawa Timur. Apabila pulang ke Jakarta, keadaannya menjadi lebih teruk.  Selepas beberapa bulan rawatan, Roekiah meninggal dunia pada 2 September 1945, seminggu selepas Indonesia mengisytiharkan kemerdekaan. Roekiah dikebumikan di Kober Hulu, Jatinegara, Jakarta. Pengebumiannya dihadiri oleh beberapa tokoh, termasuk Menteri Pendidikan Ki Hajar Dewantara.


== Keluarga ==

Roekiah berkata bahawa dia merasakan Kartolo satu padanan yang baik dengannya, menyatakan bahawa perkahwinan itu membawa mereka ""bernasib baik"". Kedua-dua telah mempunyai lima orang anak. Selepas kematian Roekiah, Kartolo membawa anak-anak ke kampung halamannya di Yogyakarta. Dalam usaha untuk menyara keluarga, beliau mengambil pekerjaan dengan Radio Republik Indonesia, bermula pada tahun 1946. Di sana, beliau menghabiskan sebahagian besar Revolusi Nasional Indonesia yang sedang berlangsung, konflik bersenjata dan perjuangan diplomatik antara yang baru mengisytiharkan Indonesia dan Kerajaan Belanda di mana negara yang baru diisytiharkan cuba untuk menerima pengiktirafan antarabangsa bagi kemerdekaan. Selepas tentera Belanda melancarkan Operasi Kraai pada 19 Disember 1948, menangkap Yogyakarta, Kartolo enggan bekerjasama dengan kuasa-kuasa penjajah kembali. Tanpa sumber pendapatan, beliau jatuh sakit dan meninggal dunia pada 18 Januari 1949.
Salah satu anak pasangan itu meninggal dunia di Yogyakarta, berumur sepuluh. Kanak-kanak yang tinggal telah dibawa ke Jakarta selepas Revolusi Nasional Indonesia berakhir pada tahun 1950, di mana mereka telah dibangkitkan oleh kawan rapat Kartolo, Adikarso. Satu, Rachmat Kartolo, pergi untuk menjadi seorang penyanyi dan pelakon yang aktif sehingga melalui tahun 1970-an, terkenal dengan lagu-lagu seperti ""Patah Hati"" dan filem-filem seperti Matjan Kemajoran (1965) dan bernafas dalam Lumpur (1970). Dua anak-anak lain, Jusuf dan Imam, bermain dalam band dengan saudara mereka sebelum mencari kerjaya di tempat lain. Anak perempuan pasangan itu, Sri Wahjuni, tidak memasuki industri hiburan.


== Legasi ==
Akhbar mengulas Roekiah mesra dengan panggilan, dan keluaran barunya secara konsisten menerima ulasan positif. Pada puncak populariti Roekiah ini, peminat berdasarkan keputusan fesyen mereka kepada apa yang Roekiah memakai pada skrin. Roekiah muncul dengan kerap dalam iklan, dan banyak rakaman dengan persembahan vokal beliau adalah yang terdapat di pasaran. Seorang peminat, dalam satu temu bual 1996, teringat bahawa Roekiah adalah ""idola setiap lelaki"", manakala yang lain menyebut Roekiah sebagai Dorothy Lamour Indonesia. Peminat lain, mengingatkan persembahan beliau telah menyaksikan lebih lima puluh tahun sebelum ini, menyatakan:
Setelah kematian Roekiah, industri perfileman Indonesia berupaya untuk mencari pengganti dirinya. Pakar filem Ekky Imanjaya memberi contoh ketika sebuah filem diiklankan dengan kata-kata ""Roekiah? Bukan! Tetapi Sofia dalam filem Indonesia baru: Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum"".  Filem-filem Roekiah dulunya ditayangkan secara rutin, namun sebahagian besarnya sudah hilang. Filem-filem Hindia Belanda dirakamkan dalam bentuk filem nitrat yang mudah terbakar, dan selepas kebakaran memusnahkan sebahagian gudang Produksi Filem Negara pada tahun 1952, filem-filem lama yang dirakam dalam bentuk nitrat juga turut musnah. JB Kristanto dari Katalog Filem Indonesia menyatakan bahawa daripada keseluruhan filem-filem Roekiah, hanya Koeda Sembrani yang masih tersimpan di Sinematek Indonesia.
Tulisan-tulisan mengenai Roekiah yang diterbitkan selepas kematiannya seringkali menyebutkan bahawa ia adalah idola dalam industri perfileman Indonesia. Imanjaya menggambarkan Roekiah sebagai ikon kecantikan pertama dalam industri perfileman Indonesia; ia juga menyebut Roekiah dan Rd Mochtar sebagai selebriti yang memperkenalkan konsep ""bintang pelaris"" pada perfileman dalam negeri. Pada tahun 1969,  Majalah Moderna menulis bahawa ""di dalam zamannya [Roekiah] telah mencapai suatu populariti yang boleh dikatakan sehingga kini belum ada penggantinya"". Pada 1977, majalah Keluarga menggelarkannya sebagai salah seorang ""perintis bintang filem Indonesia"" , menyatakan bahawa ""bakat permainannya dalam filem adalah bakat alam yang merupakan perpaduan peribadinya dengan pancaran kelembutan keayuan wajahnya yang penuh romantik"".

Ia mempunyai konduktiviti terma yang sangat baik, tak magnetik dan tahan kakisan asid nitrik. Ia juga mudah ditembusi sinaran X, dan neutron dibebaskan apabila ia dihentam oleh zarah alfa, seperti daripada radium dan polonium (lebih kurang 30 neutron-neutron/juta zarah alfa). Pada suhu dan tekanan piawai, berilium tahan pengoksidaan apabila didedahkan kepada udara (walaupun kemampuannya untuk menggores kaca adalah kemungkinannya disebabkan pembentukan lapisan nipis oksida).


== Kegunaan ==
Berilium digunakan sebagai agen pengaloian di dalam penghasilan tembaga berilium. (Be mempunyai kebolehan menyerap kandungan haba yang banyak). Aloi tembaga-berilium digunakan dalam pelbagai kegunaan oleh kerana konduktiviti elektrik dan konduktiviti termanya, kekuatan tinggi dan kekerasan, sifat yang tak magnetik, dan juga tahan kakisan serta tahan lesu (logam). Kegunaan-kegunaan ini termasuklah pembuatan: elektrod kimpalan bintik, spring, alat tukang tak mencucuh dan penyambung elektrik.
Oleh kerana ketegaran, ringan, dan kestabilan dimensi pada julat suhu yang lebar, aloi tembaga-berilium digunakan dalam industri aeroangkasa dan pertahanan iaitu sebagai bahan penstrukturan ringan dalam pesawat halaju tinggi, peluru berpandu, kapal terbang dan satelit komunikasi.
Kepingan nipis kerajang berilium digunakan bersama diagnostik pengesanan sinaran X untuk menapis cahaya nampak dan membenarkan hanya sinaran X dikesan.
Dalam bidang litografi sinaran X, berilium digunakan untuk penghasilan litar bersepadu mikroskopik.
Oleh kerana ia mempunyai keratan rentas penyerapan terma neutron yang rendah, industri tenaga nuklear menggunakan logam ini dalam reaktor nuklear sebagai pemantul neutron dan moderator.
Berilium digunakan dalam pembuatan giroskop, pelbagai alat komputer, spring jam tangan dan peralatan yang memerlukan keringanan, ketegaran dan kestabilan dimensi.
Berilium oksida sangat berguna dalam pelbagai kegunaan yang memerlukan konduktor haba yang baik, dan kekuatan serta kekerasan yang tinggi, dan juga takat lebur yang tinggi, seterusnya bertindak sebagai perintang elektrik.
Sebatian berilium pernah pada satu ketika dahulu digunakan dalam lampu kalimantang, tetapi penggunaan tersebut tergendala oleh sebab pendedahan pekerja dalam kilang penghasilan lampu kepada penyakit beriliosis.


== Sejarah ==
Nama berilium berasal daripada perkataan Yunani beryllos, beril. Pada satu ketika, berilium pernah dinamakan glucinium (daripada Yunani glykys, manis), oleh kerana rasa manis garamnya. Unsur ini dijumpai oleh Louis Vauquelin dalam tahun 1798 dalam bentuk oksida dalam beril dan dalam zamrud. Friedrich Wöhler dan A. A. Bussy masing-masing berjaya mengasingkan logam pada tahun 1828 dengan memberi tindak balas antara kalium dengan berilium klorida.


== Kejadian ==
Berilium dijumpai dalam 30 jenis garam galian berbeza, dan antara yang paling penting ialah bertrandite, beril, chrysoberyl, dan phenacite. Jenis batu permata beril termasuklah aquamarine dan zamrud. Mutakhir, kebanyakan penghasilan logam ini diselesaikan dengan mengurangkan (kimia) berilium fluorida dengan logam magnesium. Logam berilium tidak mudah didapati sehingga tahun 1957.

== Isotop ==
Berilium hanya mempunyai satu isotop stabil, Be-9. Berilium kosmogenik (Be-10) dihasilkan dalam atmosfera melalui perkecaian oksigen dan nitrogen oleh sinaran kosmik. Oleh sebab berilium seringkali wujud dalam bentuk larutan pada paras pH yang kurang daripada 5.5 (dan kebanyakan air hujan mempunyai pH kurang daripada 5), ia akan larut ke dalam larutan dan diangkut ke permukaan Bumi melalui air hujan. Apabila pemendakan dengan cepatnya menjadi semakin beralkali, Be keluar dari larutan. Be-10 kosmogenik akan berkumpul atas permukaan tanah, di mana ia mempunyai separuh hayat yang panjang (1.5 juta tahun) lalu membolehkannya menetap dengan lebih lama sebelum mereput menjadi B-10 (boron). Be-10 dan hasil reputannya digunakan dalam kajian hakisan tanah, pembentukan tanah oleh regolitos, pembentukan tanah laterit, dan juga variasi dalam aktiviti matahari dan usia teras ais. Pengetahuan bahawa Be-7 dan Be-8 yang tak stabil memberikan pendapat kesan kosmologi yang mendalam kerana ini bermaksud unsur yang lebih berat daripada berilium tidak mungkin dapat dihasilkan daripada pelakuran nuklear semasa letupan besar big bang. Malahan, aras tenaga nuklear berilium-8 memberi petunjuk bahawa karbon boleh dihasilkan dalam bintang-bintang, maka memungkinkan penghasilan hidupan. (Lihat proses tripel-alfa dan nukleosintesis big bang)


== Awasan ==
Berilium dan garamnya adalah bahan bertoksik dan berpotensi sebagai karsinogenik. Beriliosis kronik adalah penyakit granulomatous pulmonari dan sistemik yang disebabkan oleh pendedahan kepada berilium. Penyakit berilium akut dalam bentuk pneumonitis kimia pertama kali dilaporkan di Eropah pada tahun 1933 dan di Amerika Syarikat pada tahun 1943. Kes beriliosis kronik pertama kali diperincikan dalam tahun 1946 di kalangan pekerja dalam kilang penghasilan lampu kalimantang. Beriliosis kronik menyamai sarkoidisis dalam pelbagai perkara, dan diagnosis pembezaan amatlah sukar.
Walaupun sebatian berilium dalam lampu kalimantang telah dihentikan pada tahun 1949, kemungkinan pendedahan kepada berilium masih wujud daripada industri nuklear dan aeroangkasa dan dalam penulenan logam berilium dan peleburan aloi berkandungan berilium, penghasilan alat elektronik dan pengurusan bahan yang mengandungi berilium.
Pengkaji awal merasa berilium dan sebatian-sebatiannya yang lain untuk rasa kemanisan bagi memastikan kehadirannya. Alat diagnostik moden tidak lagi memerlukan prosedur berisiko tinggi ini dan percubaan untuk memakan bahan ini tidak patut dilakukan. Berilium dan sebatiannya haruslah dikendalikan dengan rapi dan pengawasan haruslah dijalankan semasa melakukan kegiatan yang memungkinkan pelepasan habuk berilium (barah peparu adalah antara akibat daripada pendedahan berpanjangan kepada habuk berilium).
Bahan ini haruslah dikendalikan dengan berhati-hati dan prosedur tertentu haruslah dipatuhi. Tidak patut ada percubaan menggunakan berilium sebelum prosedur pengendalian yang tepat diperkenalkan dan dibiasakan.


== Kesan Kesihatan ==
Berilium adalah sangat berbahaya jika disedut. Kesannya bergantung kepada kandungan yang didedahkan dan jangka masa pendedahan. Jika paras udara berilium sangat tinggi (lebih tinggi daripada 1000 μg/m³), keadaan akut boleh berlaku. Keadaan ini menyamai pneumonia dan dipanggil penyakit berilium akut. Piawaian udara komuniti dan tempat kerja adalah berkesan dalam mengelakkan kerosakan peparu yang paling akut.
Sesetengah orang (1-15%) akan menjadi sensitif (alah) kepada berilium. Orang-orang ini akan mendapat tindak balas keradangan pada sistem pernafasan. Keadaan ini dipanggil penyakit berilium kronik (CBD), dan boleh berlaku setelah pendedahan bertahun-tahun kepada paras berilium lebih daripada normal {lebih daripada 0.2 μg/m³). Penyakit ini boleh menyebabkan rasa lemah dan kelesuan, dan juga kesesakan bernafas. Ini boleh menyebabkan anoreksia, susut berat badan, dan boleh juga menyebabkan pembesaran bahagian kanan jantung dan penyakit jantung dalam kes-kes peringkat lanjut. Sesetengah orang yang alah kepada berilium mungkin atau mungkin tidak akan mendapat simptom-simptom ini. Bilangan penduduk pada umumnya jarang mendapat penyakit berilium akut atau kronik kerana paras berilium dalam udara ambien adalah pada kebiasaannya sangat rendah (0.00003-0.0002 μg/m³).
Menelan berilium tidak pernah dilaporkan menyebabkan kesan kepada manusia kerana berilium diserap sangat sedikit oleh perut dan usus. Ulser dikesan pada anjing yang mempunyai berilium pada pemakanannya. Berilium yang terkena kulit yang mempunyai luka atau terkikis mungkin akan menyebabkan radang atau ulser.
Pendedahan jangka masa panjang kepada berilium boleh meningkatkan risiko menghidap penyakit barah peparu di kalangan orang ramai.
United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) dan International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) telah memberi kepastian bahawa berilium adalah karsinogen kepada manusia. EPA menjangkakan bahawa pendedahan seumur hidup kepada 0.04 μg/m³ berilium boleh menyebabkan satu perseribu kebarangkalian untuk menghidap barah.
Tidak terdapat mana-mana kajian tentang kesan pendedahan berilium terhadap kanak-kanak. Kemungkinannya kesan kesihatan yang dilihat pada kanak-kanak yang terdedah kepada berilium adalah sama dengan kesannya terhadap orang dewasa. Kita tidak lagi mengetahui sama ada terdapat perbezaan dalam kesan terhadap berilium antara orang dewasa dan kanak-kanak.
Kita juga tidak mengetahui sama ada pendedahan terhadap berilium boleh menyebabkan kecacatan sejak lahir atau lain-lain kesan yang berlanjutan kepada orang ramai. Kajian terhadap kesan lanjutan terhadap haiwan adalah tidak konklusif.
Berilium boleh disukat dalam air kencing atau darah. Kandungan berilium dalam darah atau air kencing boleh memberi petunjuk kepada berapa banyak atau berapa lama anda telah terdedah. Paras berilium juga boleh disukat daripada sampel peparu dan kulit. Ujian-ujian ini biasanya tidak terdapat dalam bilik doktor, tetapi doktor boleh menghantar sampel ke makmal yang dapat melakukan ujian tersebut.
Satu lagi ujian darah, iaitu beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT), mengenal pasti alahan terhadap berilium dan memberikan jangkaan terhadap CBD.
Paras berilium biasa yang mungkin dilepaskan ke dalam udara daripada kawasan perindustrian adalah pada tertib 0.01 μg/m³, dipuratakan pada tempoh 30 hari, atau 2 μg/m³ dalam bilik kerja dengan syif kerja 8 jam.

Perang ini tamat dengan kemenangan Chile, yang mana mendapat jumlah wilayah yang luas daripada Peru dan Bolivia. Perang ini berlaku di Lautan Pasifik, Padang Pasir Atacama, padang pasir di Peru, dan wilayah pergunungan di Andes. Pada lima bulan pertama, kebanyakan pertempuran berlaku di laut, di mana Chile bergelut untuk mewujudkan koridor pangkalan bekalan semula bagi menyokong pasukan tenteranya yang berperang di padang pasir paling kering di dunia.
Pada bulan Februari 1878, Bolivia telah mengenakan satu cukai baru ke atas sebuah syarikat perlombongan Chile (""Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta"", CSFA) meskipun Bolivia memberi jaminan dalam Perjanjian Sempadan 1874 bahawa ia tidak akan menaikkan cukai ke atas orang perseorangan atau syarikat Chile selama 25 tahun. Chile membantah dan memohon agar berunding, akan tetapi Bolivia enggan dan menyerahkannya kepada mahkamah Bolivia. Chile mendesak dan memberitahu kerajaan Bolivia bahawa ia tidak lagi terikat dengan Perjanjian Sempadan 1874 seekiranya Bolivia tidak menghentikan penguatkuasaan undang-undang ini. Pada 14 Februari, 1879 apabila pihak berkuasa Bolivia cuba untuk melelong harta-harta yang dirampas daripada CSFA, pasukan bersenjata Chile menduduki bandar pelabuhan di Antofagasta.
Peru, terikat dengan Bolivia melalui Perjanjian Perikatan Rahsia Bolivia dan Peru (1873), cuba untuk menjadi pengantara, tetapi pada 1 Mac 1879 Bolivia mengistiharkan perang ke atas Chile dan meminta Peru untuk mengaktifkan perikatan mereka, sementara itu pada masa yang sama Chile menuntut agar Peru mengistiharkan pendiriannya agar tidak berpihak. Pada April 5, selepas Peru enggan, Chile mengistiharkan perang ke atas kedua-dua negara. Pada hari berikutnya, Peru bertindak balas dengan menerima casus foederis.
Chile melakukan kempen di daratan untuk menentang pasukan tentera Bolivia dan Peru. Bolivia berundur selepas Pertempuran Tacna pada 26 Mei, 1880. Pasukan bersenjata Chile menduduki Lima pada bulan Januari 1881. Tinggalan dari Tentera Darat Peru dan tentera kerahan kemudian melakukan perang gerila ke atas Chile yang mana tidak memberi kesan kepada keputusan perang. Pada 20 Oktober 1883, Chile dan Peru menandatangani Perjanjian Ancón, manakala Bolivia menandatangani perjanjian damai dengan Chile pada tahun 1884.
Chile memperolehi wilayah Peru di Tarapacá, Jabatan Pantai Bolivia yang dipertikaikan (memutuskan Bolivia dengan laut), selain menguasai sementara ke atas wilayah-wilayah Peru di Tacna dan Arica. Pada tahun 1904, Chile dan Bolivia menandatangani ""Perjanjian Damai dan Persaudaraan"" mewujudkan sempadan yang muktamad. Pada tahun 1929, Kompromi Arica-Tacna telah menyaksikan Arica diserahkan kepada Chile manakala Tacna kepada Peru.

Ia digelar ''Menara Condong China'.


== Sejarah ==
Ia adalah pagoda bekas Kuil Yunyan. Pembinaan bermula pada 907 CE, semasa tempoh akhir Lima Dinasti, ketika Suzhou diperintah oleh Kerajaan Wuyue. Ia telah siap dibina pada 961 CE semasa Dinasti Song.
Tingkat bahagian paling atas pagoda telah dibina sebagai tambahan semasa pemerintahan Maharaja Chongzhen (1628-1644), maharaja terakhir Dinasti Ming.


== Gambaran ==
Pagoda Yunyan tersergam pada ketinggian 47 m (154 kaki). Pagoda itu memiliki tujuh tingkat dan berbentuk oktagon dalam keratan rentas, dan dibina dengan struktur batu yang direka untuk meniru struktur pagoda kayu yang lazim pada masa itu.


== Menara condong ==
Dalam lebih daripada seribu tahun pagoda telah beransur-ansur condong kerana kuasa alam. Sekarang bahagian atas dan bawah menara itu berbeza sekitar 2.32 meter. Seluruh struktur mempunyai berat sekitar 7,000,000 kilogram (£ 15000000), disokong oleh tiang-tiang bata dalaman. Walau bagaimanapun, pagoda condong sekitar 3 darjah kerana keretakan dua tiang sokongan.
Pagoda itu condong kerana asasnya adalah separuh batu dan separuh lagi berada di atas tanah. Pada tahun 1957, usaha telah diambil untuk menstabilkan pagoda dan mencegah ia dari condong lagi. Konkrit juga telah dipam ke dalam tanah membentuk asas yang lebih kukuh.
Semasa proses tetulang, satu keranda batu yang mengandungi kitab-kitab Buddha ditemui. Bekas itu mempunyai tulisan menyatakan tarikh penyelesaian pagoda sebagai hari yang ketujuh belas bulan yang kedua belas dalam tahun yang kedua zaman Jianlong yang (961 CE).


== Masa kini ==
Pagoda Yunyan telah diistiharkan sebagai tapak sejarah kebangsaan dan budaya utama di Jiangsu. Sehingga September 2010 capaian awam ke puncak menara itu tidak lagi dibenarkan.

1443,"José Paes de Lira Filho, mais conhecido como Lirinha (Arcoverde, 9 de novembro de 1976), é um compositor, poeta e escritor brasileiro.


== Trajetória ==
Desde muito cedo frequentava rodas de recitais e “pelejas” dos cantadores e violeiros que aconteciam na fazenda de seu avô. Logo aprendeu a decorar versos e fazer rimas e, com apenas doze anos, foi convidado por Ivanildo Vila Nova e Ésio Rafael para declamar poesias no Teatro de Santa Isabel, o teatro mais tradicional de Pernambuco, no 4º. Congresso de Cantadores do Recife. Sua desenvoltura neste evento foi alvo de matéria do Diário de Pernambuco.
Sempre transitando no universo da literatura, música e teatro, além de participar da banda Cordel do Fogo Encantado, atuou em peças de teatro e filmes, e assinou trilhas sonoras para espetáculos e filmes.
Em 1997, José Paes de Lira se uniu com os conterrâneos Noé Lira, Alberoni Padilha e Pastor no projeto Cordel do Fogo Encantado, inspirado nas obras de cantadores e declamadores.
Em 1998, amadureceu o projeto teatral Cordel do Fogo Encantado, adicionando outros elementos da cultura popular local, resultado de uma pesquisa sobre manifestações do coco de roda e do reizado, saudando músicas do mestre Lula Calixto (samba de coco), mestre Horácio (reisado das caraíbas), padrinho Batista (banda de pífanos) ainda em formato teatral com 40 minutos de declamações e apenas 30 minutos de música. O espetáculo foi sucesso de público e percorreu o interior do estado de Pernambuco. Com direção de Miro Carvalho, cenário e luz de Roberto Baby, e no elenco José Paes de Lira, Clayton Barros, François Gomes, Alberone Padilha e Lúcio Flávio (DJ Coby).
Em Recife, no carnaval de 1999, o grupo se apresentou no Festival Rec-Beat, e o que era apenas uma peça teatral ganhou contornos de um espetáculo musical. Assim começou a trajetória da banda Cordel do Fogo Encantado, onde José Paes de Lira atua como vocalista, percussionista e compositor, juntamente com o violonista Clayton Barros. Ao grupo se uniram os percussionistas Emerson Calado, Nêgo Henrique e Rafa Almeida, ficando assim com essa formação definitiva.
Desde a sua estréia, a banda chamou a atenção de público e crítica, ultrapassou as fronteiras e ganhou visibilidade em todo país. As apresentações surpreendem a todos pela força da mistura sonora, pela presença marcante da poesia, pela forte presença cênica de seus integrantes e os requintes de um projeto de iluminação e cenário.
No fim de 2007, José Paes de Lira estreou o solo teatral de sua autoria Mercadorias e Futuro, que seguiu em turnê por todo o Brasil. Junto com a peça, lançou seu primeiro livro, Mercadorias e Futuro.
Em 2008 lançou seu segundo trabalho em literatura, a adaptação do filme infantil Garoto Cósmico, de Alê Abreu. Em fevereiro de 2010, Lirinha decidiu trilhar novos caminhos, encerrando assim as atividade do Cordel do Fogo Encantado.
Foi casado durante sete anos com a atriz Leandra Leal, de quem se separou em 2010.

1444,"A Men's Health é uma revista mensal estadunidense, com edições próprias em vários países. É a maior revista do gênero para homens, com 38 edições em todo o mundo, em tiragem mensal de 1,85 milhões e 12 milhões de leitores mensais naquele país, onde é recorde de vendas de revistas masculinas em bancas.

No Brasil é publicada pela Editora Abril, em parceira com a editora alemã Gruner + Jahr, com primeira edição em 2 de maio de 2006.


== História ==
Lançado em 1987 nos Estados Unidos como uma revista de serviços de saúde orientado pelo editor fundador Mark Bricklin, Men's Health evoluiu em mais de uma revista de estilo de vida para os homens, cobrindo todos os aspectos da vida de um homem: saúde, fitness, moda, nutrição, relacionamentos, viagens, tecnologia , moda e das finanças. Stephen Perrine, editorial da revista, ex-diretor de criação, uma vez que resumiu a amplitude da cobertura da revista, disse: ""Eu não tenho problemas. Eu tenho idéias da história "". David Zinczenko foi o editor-chefe da Men's Health desde 2000. Jack Essig é o editor. Durante este período, a circulação da revista cresceu 30 por cento, e páginas de publicidade têm crescido 80 por cento, de 700 páginas para 1150. Em 2004, começou a colocar na capa celebridades e atletas, exclusivamente, e sem camisas a partir do olhar da capa da década de 1990. Em maio de 2006, a revista publicou uma edição limitada de capa com de Josh Holloway.
Sob a liderança de Zinczenko's, Men's Health foi nomeado para oitava National Magazine Awards. Ela venceu na categoria de serviço social em 2004, o primeiro para a revista, e para a empresa-mãe Rodale. Foi também nomeado para ""Advertising Age"" ""The List"" várias vezes, e à Adweek's Hot "". Em março de 2008, Adweek Zinczenko foi nomeado ""Editor de do Ano "".
No outono de 2007, Men's Health lançou a iniciativa FitSchools para combater a obesidade infantil. A revista falava saúde, fitness e especialistas em nutrição para as escolas selecionadas de cada ano para refazer a programas de educação física e ofertas de merenda escolar. Gettys Middle School, em Easley,Carolina do Sul, foi o primeiro FitSchool. Na Primavera de 2008, a revista lançou a Fundação FitSchools, uma organização sem fins lucrativos com a missão de ajudar a obesidade infantil final para receber crianças dos Estados Unidos interessados na vida ativa e saudável.


== Críticas ==
A Revista Men's Health tem sido criticado por sua incansável centrada no desenvolvimento do corpo perfeito, que pode aumentar a ansiedade dos homens sobre seus corpos. Isso pode tornar os homens mais propensos a desenvolver distúrbios alimentares e o compulsivo excesso de exercício.


== Fim ==
No dia 19 de novembro de 2015 a Editora Abril decidiu encerrar a publicação da revista. De acordo com a empresa, a Men's Health brasileira estaria com constantes quedas de venda, por isso foi uma das encerradas, junto com a Women's Health e Playboy.

1455,"João Sandes Júnior (Porto Nacional, 28 de abril de 1959) é um radialista e político brasileiro.
Graduado em Direito pela Universidade Católica de Goiás, é radialista desde 1978.
Elegeu-se vereador da cidade de Goiânia em 1988, deputado estadual seguidamente em 1990, 1994 e 1998. Já nas eleições de 2002 elege-se deputado federal por Goiás, sendo reeleito em 2006 e 2010.
Também concorreu a prefeitura de Goiânia por três vezes: 1992, 2004 e 2008. Foi membro do PMDB, PDT e PFL. Pertence atualmente ao PP desde quando esta agremiação era conhecida como PPB.


== Denúncias de corrupção ==
Sandes Júnior foi flagrado negociando diretamente com Carlinhos Cachoeira a realização de uma concorrência pública. O deputado admitiu ser amigo de Cachoeira, mas afirmou que cheques mencionados em diálogo (que somavam R$ 50 mil) eram de uma rádio em que trabalhou e que Cachoeira ""estava brincando ao fazer a cobrança de metade do valor"".
Sandes Júnior também pediu a Cachoeira ajuda financeira para bancar pesquisa eleitoral. Em uma conversa gravada pela Polícia Federal, o parlamentar recorre ao bicheiro para obter R$ 7 mil para uma sondagem de intenções de votos à prefeitura de Goiânia. Cachoeira, com interesse em contratos no município, trabalhava para emplacar a candidatura do senador Demóstenes Torres nas eleições de 2012, enquanto Sandes fazia lobby para ser vice de Demóstenes, apontado como favorito em levantamentos internos de partidos aliados.
Sandes Júnior também pediu a Cachoeira ajuda para bancar viagem ao exterior do time de futebol em que joga o seu filho adolescente. O parlamentar apelou (em 28 de abril de 2011) a Carlinhos Cachoeira para que o contraventor conseguisse R$ 150 mil com a cúpula do Laboratório NeoQuímica de Anápolis (GO), para que os jogadores do Colégio Podium, de Goiânia, participassem de competição em Orlando, nos Estados Unidos. O filho de Sandes também viajaria com a equipe.
O deputado já havia sido flagrado na Operação Vegas encomendando a Cachoeira a importação de equipamentos que, uma vez adquiridos, permitiriam a montagem de uma emissora de rádio.
Sandes Júnior tornou-se alvo de inquérito no STF e de representação na Corregedoria da Câmara,.
Em abril de 2012 foi notificado pela Corregedoria da Câmara para apresentar explicações sobre seu suposto envolvimento com o contraventor Carlinhos Cachoeira. Mas foi absolvido por unanimidade decisão essa já ratificada pela mesa diretora da Câmara. Além disso, o então procurador geral da república, Roberto Gurgel, já pediu o arquivamento do inquérito no STF.
Obteve a suplência no pleito de 2014 e assumiu temporariamente o mandato de deputado federal devido a nomeação do eleito Thiago Peixoto a cargo no governo do Estado de Goiás.

1458,"A morna é um género musical e de dança de Cabo Verde. Tradicionalmente tocada com instrumentos acústicos, a morna reflecte a realidade insular do povo de Cabo Verde, o romantismo intoxicante dos seus trovadores e o amor à terra (ter de partir e querer ficar).
Nos últimos anos, a morna foi levada a ser conhecida internacionalmente por vários artistas, nomeadamente em França e nos Estados Unidos, sendo a mais famosa Cesária Évora. O timbre da voz desta diva conquistou e alargou o público da morna, de Cabo Verde até o Olympia, passando pelo Carnegie Hall, pelo Hollywood Bowl e pelo Canecão.
A morna é o género musical que mais identifica o povo cabo-verdiano. Trata-se verdadeiramente de um símbolo nacional, do mesmo modo que o tango é para a Argentina, a rumba para Cuba, o samba para o Brasil, etc. Alguns géneros musicais de Cabo Verde podem ser mais ou menos apreciados pelos nativos conforme a idade do ouvinte, a época, a ilha de origem, o gosto pessoal, mas a morna é o único género que consegue ser largamente transversal a todos os grupos etários, cronologicamente, geograficamente, etc.
É também o único género que sempre gozou de mais prestígio e de um carácter mais «nobre» em Cabo Verde.


== Como género musical ==

Como género musical, a morna caracteriza-se por ter um andamento lento, um compasso binário (às vezes quaternário), e, na sua forma mais tradicional, ter uma estrutura harmónica baseada no ciclo de quintas, enquanto que a estrutura poética se organiza em estrofes que vão alternando com um refrão. A morna é quase sempre monotónica, ou seja, composta apenas numa tonalidade. Composições que utilizam mais do que uma tonalidade são raras, e geralmente trata-se de passagens de uma tonalidade menor para maior, ou vice-versa.


=== Estrutura harmónica ===
Conforme foi dito anteriormente, na sua forma mais tradicional a morna obedece a um ciclo de quintas. A progressão harmónica começa num acorde (a tónica) de uma determinada tonalidade, o segundo acorde é a quinta inferior (a subdominante), o terceiro acorde é o mesmo que o primeiro, e por fim o quarto acorde é a quinta superior (a sétima da dominante). Popularmente, esses acordes — tónica, sétima da dominante, subdominante — têm em Cabo Verde os nomes de «primeira», «segunda» e «terceira» da tonalidade em questão. Por exemplo, se a música estiver a ser interpretada na tonalidade de Lá menor, o acorde de Lá m tem o nome de «primeira de Lá menor», o acorde de Mi 7 tem o nome de «segunda de Lá menor» e o acorde de Ré m tem o nome de «terceira de Lá menor».
Note-se, no entanto, que esta estrutura corresponde à forma mais básica e mais primária da sequência harmónica da morna. Primeiro, essa estrutura foi posteriormente enriquecida com os chamados acordes de passagem (ver mais adiante secção História). Segundo, esta estrutura não é de modo algum obrigatória. Muitos compositores (sobretudo compositores mais recentes) empregam sequências de acordes diferentes.


=== Estrutura melódica ===
A linha melódica da morna varia muito ao longo da composição, com sequências de notas ascendentes e descendentes, e num compasso, as figuras geralmente não são iguais. Uma característica frequente na melodia da morna é o uso da síncope, mais precisamente, uma nota no fim de um compasso é prolongada para o tempo forte do compasso seguinte. Ritmicamente, a melodia é acentuada no primeiro tempo e no último meio-tempo do compasso.
A melodia está estruturada em versos, que por sua vez se organizam em estrofes. As estrofes principais alternam com uma estrofe-refrão, e essa alternância pode apresentar vários modelos: ABABAB…, ABCBABCB…, ACBACB…, AABCCB…, etc. A melodia do refrão nunca é igual à melodia das outras estrofes.


=== Temática ===
A temática da morna é variada, mas há certos temas que são usados com maior frequência. Para além de temas universais, como o amor, por exemplo, são também abordados temas próprios da realidade cabo-verdiana, como a partida para o estrangeiro, o regresso, a saudade, o amor à pátria, o mar, etc. Um dos grandes responsáveis pela temática da morna foi o poeta/compositor Eugénio Tavares, que introduziu no início do séc. XX o lirismo e a exploração de sentimentos, típicos do romantismo, lirismo esse que perdura até os dias de hoje na morna.


=== Instrumentação ===
O instrumento por excelência para acompanhar a morna é a guitarra, chamada popularmente de «violão» em Cabo Verde. Na sua forma mais simples um violão é suficiente para fornecer um acompanhamento para outro instrumento solista, que pode ser outro violão, um violino (chamado popularmente de «rabeca» em Cabo Verde), a voz do cantor, ou outro instrumento melódico qualquer. A maneira específica de dedilhar as cordas num violão é chamada popularmente de «mãozada». A mãozada da morna articula um baixo (executado com o polegar, marcando a acentuação do ritmo) com acordes (executados com os outros dedos, quer em harpejo, quer ritmicamente, quer numa combinação dos dois). A morna também pode ser executada ao piano, com a mão esquerda a fornecer o baixo e o acompanhamento, e a mão direita a fornecer o acompanhamento e a melodia.
A composição de um agrupamento para tocar morna não é fixa. Um agrupamento médio pode integrar (para além do violão já referido) um cavaquinho (que executa os acordes ritmicamente), uma viola de dez ou doze cordas (chamada popularmente de «viola» em Cabo Verde), que fornece um suporte harmónico, um instrumento solista para além da voz do cantor, e algum instrumento de percussão. Um agrupamento maior já pode conter ainda mais um violão, um baixo acústico, mais do que um instrumento solista (rabeca, clarinete, trompete, etc.) e vários instrumentos de percussão (chocalho, reco-reco, bongos, etc.).
A partir dos anos 60 do séc. XX, assiste-se à ""electrificação"" da morna, em que os instrumentos de percussão são substituídos pela bateria, e o jogo de baixo/acompanhamento executados no violão é substituído pelo baixo elétrico e pela guitarra eléctrica. Nos fins dos anos 90, assiste-se a um retorno às raízes, onde interpretações unplugged (acústicas) voltam a ser procuradas.
Na sua forma mais tradicional, a música começa por uma introdução executada pelo instrumento solista (introdução essa, geralmente com a mesma melodia que o refrão), e depois a música estrutura-se numa alternância entre as estrofes principais e o refrão. Aproximadamente depois do meio da música, em vez do refrão cantado, o instrumento solista executa um improviso. Compositores mais recentes, no entanto, nem sempre seguem esta sequência.


== Como dança ==
Como dança, a morna constitui uma dança de salão, dançada aos pares. Os executantes dançam com um braço a enlaçar o parceiro enquanto que com o outro braço mantêm as mãos dadas. A dança é efectuada imprimindo duas oscilações do corpo, para um lado, num compasso da música, enquanto que no compasso seguinte as oscilações são feitas para o outro lado.


== História ==
A história da morna pode ser dividida em vários períodos, nem sempre reunindo o consenso entre estudiosos:


=== 1.º período: as origens ===
Não se sabe ao certo quando e onde surgiu a morna. A tradição oral tem como dado assente que a morna surgiu na ilha da Boa Vista, no séc. XVIII, mas não existem registros musicológicos a corroborar isso. Mas a afirmação de Alves dos Reis que durante o séc. XIX, com invasão de polcas, mazurcas, galopes, contradanças e outros géneros musicais em Cabo Verde, a morna não se deixou influenciar, deixa entender que já nessa altura a morna era uma forma musical adulta e acabada.
Mesmo assim, alguns autores fazem remontar a morna a um género musical — o lundum — que teria sido introduzido em Cabo Verde no séc. XVIII. Existe também uma relação entre a morna e outro género musical que já existia nas ilhas, os choros, que são melopeias vocálicas cantadas em certas ocasiões, de que fazem parte as cantigas de trabalho e os choros fúnebres. A morna seria então um cruzamento dos choros com o lundum, com um andamento mais lento e uma estrutura harmónica mais complexa. Alguns autores afirmam que se acelerarmos o andamento de algumas mornas mais antigas da Boa Vista, ou até da morna Força di cretcheu de Eugénio Tavares, obtemos algo muito semelhante ao lundum.
A partir da Boa Vista, essa nova forma musical teria gradualmente passado para as outras ilhas. Nessa altura, a morna ainda não teria a temática romântica que tem hoje, e nem teria o carácter nobilizante que lhe foi conferido depois.
A origem para a palavra «morna» para este género musical é incerta. No entanto existem três teorias, cada uma com os seus defensores e detractores.
Para uns, a palavra deriva do inglês to mourn, que significa lamentar ou chorar os mortos. Para outros, a palavra tem origem no francês morne, que é o nome dado a colinas ou morros nas Antilhas francesas, onde são interpretadas as chansons des mornes. Mas para a maioria, a palavra «morna» corresponderia ao feminino da palavra portuguesa «morno», numa alusão ao carácter suave e dolente da morna.


=== 2.º período: Eugénio Tavares ===
No início do séc. XX, o poeta Eugénio Tavares foi um dos principais responsáveis por conferir à morna o carácter romântico que ela tem até hoje. Na ilha Brava, a morna transformou-se, adquirindo um andamento mais lento que a morna da Boa Vista, e a poesia tornou-se lírica com os temas a incidir sobretudo no amor e em sentimentos provocados por esse mesmo amor.


=== 3.º período: B. Leza ===
Nos anos 30 e 40 a morna adquiriu características especiais em São Vicente. O estilo bravense era muito apreciado e cultivado em todo Cabo Verde nessa altura (há relatos de E. Tavares ter sido recebido em apoteose na ilha de S. Vicente, e os próprios compositores de Barlavento escreviam em crioulo de Sotavento, provavelmente porque a manutenção das vogais átonas nos crioulos de Sotavento conferiam maior musicalidade). Mas características peculiares de S. Vicente, como o cosmopolitismo e a facilidade de ingerência de influências estrangeiras, trouxeram enriquecimentos à morna.
Um dos responsáveis pelo enriquecimento da morna foi o compositor Francisco Xavier da Cruz (mais conhecido por B. Leza) que, sob influência da música brasileira, introduziu os chamados acordes de passagem, popularmente conhecidos por «meio-tom brasileiro» em Cabo Verde. Graças a esses acordes de passagem, a estrutura harmónica da morna não se restringiu aos acordes do ciclo de quintas, mas passou a integrar outros acordes que servem de transição aos acordes principais.
A título de exemplo, uma música numa tonalidade de Dó M podia ser enriquecida da seguinte forma:
Outro exemplo, mas desta vez com uma tonalidade de Lá m:
Essa introdução dos meios-tons, por mais simples que possa parecer, deixou a sua marca profunda na morna, marca essa que se transmitiu posteriormente à coladeira.
Outra inovação foi o facto de este período coincidir sensivelmente com o movimento literário Claridade, e por conseguinte houve um alargamento na temática, que deixou de incluir essencialmente temas ligados ao Romantismo, para incluir temas mais realistas.


=== 4.º período: anos 50 a 70 ===
Neste período, um novo género musical, a coladeira, atinge a sua maturidade, e muitos compositores experimentam essa novidade. De modo que, os anos 50 a 70 não trouxeram grandes inovações em termos de técnicas musicais para a morna, com os compositores compondo na senda de E. Tavares e B. Leza.
No entanto surgiram composições de «subtil traço melódico e sentimental», e se a nível político começam a surgir movimentos de contestação à política colonial portuguesa, na morna isso é feito de uma forma velada, com um alargamento de temas a incluir louvores à terra natal ou a personagens estimadas na terra natal. Na temática também se vai buscar inspiração em músicas vindas de outras paragens (bolero, samba-canção, canção americana, canção francesa, etc.). Nos anos 70 surgiram inclusive composições com carácter de intervenção política.
É também a partir dos anos 60 que se começam a usar instrumentos eléctricos e que se começa a divulgar internacionalmente a morna, quer através de interpretações no estrangeiro, quer através de produção discográfica.


=== 5.º período: os anos mais recentes ===
Os compositores mais recentes aproveitaram-se de maiores liberdades artísticas para conferir à morna características pouco habituais. As mornas mais recentes nem sempre seguem o esquema de ciclo de quintas, há uma grande liberdade na sequência de acordes, as estrofes musicais nem sempre têm um número rígido de versos, na melodia as reminiscências do lundum praticamente desapareceram, e alguns compositores tentam a fusão da morna com outros géneros musicais.


== Variantes da morna ==


=== A morna da Boa Vista ===
A morna da Boa Vista é a variante mais antiga da morna. Caracteriza-se por ter um andamento mais rápido (andante, ± 96 bpm) e um estilo rubato, por ser estruturalmente mais simples, e por os temas abordarem frequentemente situações jocosas, sátiras ou críticas sociais. A acentuação melódica é muito parecida com o lundum.


=== A morna da Brava ===
A morna da Brava está na origem da variante da morna mais conhecida hoje em dia. Para além de ter um andamento mais lento que a morna da Boa Vista (andamento lento, ± 60 bpm), possui características típicas do Romantismo, como o uso de rimas na poesia, um lirismo acentuado e uma métrica mais rígida. O estilo bravense ainda é bastante cultivado por compositores da Brava e do Fogo.


=== A morna de São Vicente ===
A morna de São Vicente é um sucedâneo da morna da Brava. Ambas possuem o mesmo andamento, mas na morna de São Vicente as sequências de acordes foram enriquecidas com os acordes de passagem. A temática também foi alargada, não incluindo apenas temas românticos, e a poesia não é tão rígida nem faz tanto uso das rimas como na morna bravense.
A partir da morna de S. Vicente, assiste-se por parte de compositores recentes mais criativos a outras variantes da morna que ainda não estão sistematizadas.

1463,"A Ciclosporina é uma droga imunossupressora, da classe dos inibidores de calcineurina, isolada do fungo Tolypocladium inflatum, habitante do solo. A ciclosporina suprime as reações imunológicas que causam rejeição de órgãos transplantados, reduzindo a probabilidade de rejeição, com a vantagem de não apresentar os efeitos colaterais indesejáveis de outras drogas usadas para esse fim. A ciclosporina tornou-se disponível em 1979, possibilitando o retorno às atividades de transplante anteriormente abandonadas. Como resultado do uso da ciclosporina, as cirurgias bem-sucedidas de transplantes tornaram-se corriqueiras.
Por muitos anos foi considerado medicamento de primeira escolha na linha terapêutica, mas, devido diversos eventos adversos, atribuídos ao seu uso, entre eles a hiperplasia gengival vem sendo substituida por outros medicamentos da mesma classe terapêutica, como tacrolimo.


== Descoberta ==
O efeito imunodepressivo da ciclosporina foi descoberto em 31 de janeiro de 1972 por empregados da Sandoz (hoje Novartis) em Basileia, Suíça, em um teste de imunodepressão projetado e realizado pelo doutor Hartmann F. Stähelin. O sucesso da Ciclosporina A na prevenção da rejeição de órgãos foi demonstrado em transplantes de fígado realizado pelo doutor Thomas Starzl, do Hospital da Universidade de Pittsburgh. O primeiro paciente, em 9 de março de 1980, foi uma mulher de 28 anos. O uso da Ciclosporina foi subsequentemente aprovado em 1983.


== Mecanismo de ação ==
A ciclosporina é um imunomodulador específico com ação na inibição de linfócitos T.
Desde o início da década 1970, a ciclosporina teve indicação para tratamento da psoríase moderada a grave - doença sistêmica imunomediada - com excelentes resultados no controle clínico das lesões, sendo utilizado em doses baixas semanais e sem os efeitos tóxicos no fígado. É necessário controle com exames bioquímicos antes e durante o uso. Também é eficaz para alguns casos de artrite psoríasica, segundo consensos internacionais como do GRAPPA.

1470,"A Fortaleza de São Sebastião da Ilha de Moçambique é uma fortaleza localizada na ilha de Moçambique, na província de Nampula, em Moçambique. A ilha, com apenas 2,5 quilómetros de comprimento por cerca de 1 quilómetro de largura, localiza-se a cerca de 5 quilómetros na costa norte do país, entre o canal de Moçambique e a baía de Mossuril. A cidade de Ilha de Moçambique foi a capital da África Oriental Portuguesa entre os anos de 1570 e 1898 (quando se deslocou para Lourenço Marques, atual Maputo), tendo se constituído num importante centro missionário. Atualmente, encontra-se classificada como Património Mundial pela Unesco.
A fortaleza foi erguida no século XVI pelas forças portuguesas com fim de dar proteção e apoio às naus em trânsito de e para o Oriente, a chamada Carreira da Índia. Considerada como o mais representativo exemplo da arquitetura militar portuguesa na costa da África oriental, atendeu, complementarmente, ao tráfego marítimo regional para Quelimane, Sofala, Inhambane e Lourenço Marques.


== História ==


=== Antecedentes: a Torre Velha ===

À época da chegada de Vasco da Gama (1498), a ilha de Moçambique constituía-se em uma povoação swahili governada por um xeque, subordinado ao sultão de Zanzibar. Constituía-se então no maior porto islâmico e no maior centro de construção naval do leste africano, relacionando-se com o Mar Vermelho, a Pérsia, a Índia e as ilhas do Índico.
Após a fundação de uma feitoria Portuguesa em Sofala desde 1505, aqui também foi estabelecida uma feitoria desde 1507, em busca do ouro do Monomotapa e para dar apoio às armadas da Índia que aqui faziam a invernada, ""com casas pera recolhimento da gente"". Nestas feitorias, eram permutados panos e missangas da Índia pelo ouro, escravos, marfim e pau-preto oferecidos naquele trecho da costa africana. Para a sua defesa, por determinação de Vasco Gomes de Abreu, capitão de Sofala (e por extensão, então governador de Moçambique, subordinado a D. Francisco de Almeida, primeiro Vice-rei do Estado Português da Índia), o feitor, Duarte de Melo, iniciou em 1508 a Torre de São Gabriel, mais comumente referida como Torre de Moçambique.
Foi concluída durante uma única invernada, graças à mão de obra abundante e ociosa da gente da armada, sem que obedecesse a qualquer plano prévio. Constituía-se em uma torre de planta quadrada, em estilo manuelino, dividida internamente em três pavimentos, defendida por uma muralha circundante, com torres menores nos vértices. Foi artilhada e guarnecida por quinze homens.
A torre cumpriu plenamente a sua finalidade até que, em 1538, a aliança entre o sultão do Guzerate e os Turcos para a recuperação da Praça-forte de Diu, já então na posse dos portugueses, fez temer pela segurança das posições portuguesas no Índico Ocidental. Ainda assim, apenas duas década mais tarde, em 1558 a primitiva torre foi substituída por uma fortificação de maiores dimensões e de traça mais moderna, a Fortaleza de São Sebastião, em novo local.
A agora denominada Torre Velha foi parcialmente desmantelada pelos Neerlandeses durante os cercos do início do século XVII. Os religiosos da Companhia de Jesus haviam obtido o terreno onde a torre se erguia, com a condição de completarem a demolição da estrutura e de não erguerem construções que pudessem ser usadas como padrasto à nova fortaleza por parte de futuros atacantes. Porém, ignorando as ordens régias, a fortíssima estrutura da Torre Velha foi reaproveitada como alicerce da capela do Colégio de São Paulo, atual Palácio dos Capitães-Generais, nela vindo a estabelecer-se uma bateria Neerlandesa que causou pesados danos às muralhas da Fortaleza de São Sebastião durante os ataques de 1607 e 1608.
Ainda no século XVI, com o objetivo de defender a parte norte da ilha de Moçambique, foi erguido um pequeno baluarte artilhado, onde mais tarde seria erguida a Capela de Nossa Senhora do Baluarte (1522), templo este que é considerado a mais antiga edificação europeia na costa oriental africana.


=== A fortaleza seiscentista ===

Por volta de 1538, o sultão do Guzerate celebrou um acordo com a Sublime Porta visando reconquistar Diu, então em mãos dos Portugueses. Esta aliança rompia o equilíbrio de forças existente na região, trazendo insegurança às posições Portuguesas no Índico Ocidental, entre as quais Moçambique já desempenhava um papel estratégico. As galeras turcas, artilhadas, passaram a aventurar-se até Melinde apoiando a revolta das cidades swahili contra a tutela Portuguesa, entre as quais a de Mombaça, aumentando o clima de insegurança naquele litoral.
A primitiva Torre de São Gabriel, nesse contexto, tornava-se vulnerável a um ataque com artilharia dos turcos. Por essa razão, o Capitão-mor da costa de Melinde, João de Sepúlveda, fez a recomendação, à época, da construção de uma nova e mais poderosa fortaleza na Ilha de Moçambique capaz de preservar esta escala estratégica da ameaça turca.
O quarto Vice-rei do Estado Português da Índia, D. João de Castro, em carta ao rei D. João III (1521-1557), datada de Agosto de 1545, ao partir da ilha em direção a Goa, onde ia assumir as suas funções, sobre o assunto referiu:
""(...) desta fortaleza [de São Gabriel] não deue V. A. de fazer nenhum fumdamento que se pode guardar como aguara esta, nem pêra a mamdar forteficar, asy por ser muyto pequena como por estar no majs roym sytyo de toda a Ilha, e a despesa que se nela fizer per estes dous respeitos será botada a lomje, porque he em sy tam pequena que com mais verdade se poderá chamar bastião ou baluarte que castelo e fortaleza."" (D. João de Castro. Obras completas.)
Na mesma carta ao soberano, D. João de Castro preconizava uma nova fortaleza capaz de enfrentar a ameaça da então moderna artilharia turca, juntando um projeto de sua autoria, elaborado na ocasião. No ano seguinte, por carta de 8 de Março de 1546, o soberano respondia-lhe, agradecendo as informações e ""o debuxo (...) da fortaleza de Moçambique"", e informando-o de que encarregara o arquiteto Miguel de Arruda de a desenhar.
As diretrizes apontadas por D. João de Castro para a sua construção condizem, em linhas gerais, com a atual Fortaleza de São Sebastião, em uma extremidade da ilha, dominando o canal de acesso ao porto interior, com dois baluartes sobre a praia pelo lado virado à ilha permitindo o fogo cruzado. Aparentemente Miguel de Arruda limitou-se a fixar o projeto que D. João de Castro remetera ao soberano. Ainda de acordo com este plano, o canal de Sancul deveria ser obstruído, o que nunca ocorreu. Francisco Pires, mestre de pedraria encarregado das obras da Fortaleza de Diu, levou consigo para a Índia, naquele ano de 1546, este risco para a nova fortificação de Moçambique.
Apesar da prioridade que a Coroa deu ao projeto, o Estado Português da Índia estava envolvido, entre outros, com o reforço do sistema defensivo de Ormuz, pelo que as obras da Fortaleza de São Sebastião apenas começaram em 1554 ou 1555. De acordo com Frei João dos Santos, o traçado da Fortaleza de Moçambique é da autoria de um sobrinho do arcebispo de Braga, D. Frei Bartolomeu dos Mártires, ""o qual arquiteto sendo mancebo se foi a Flandres, donde tornou grande oficial de arquitetura"". Este arquiteto teria sido enviado em 1558 à Índia com a tarefa de erguer fortalezas em Moçambique e Damão. Possivelmente limitou-se a dar início à execução do projeto de Miguel de Arruda, que por sua vez obedecia aos ditames de D. João de Castro. É fato que as obras avançaram muito lentamente, encontrando-se interrompidas em várias ocasiões: à escassez de mão de obra qualificada, somava-se a dificuldade do clima, que dizimava os pedreiros, oriundos em sua maior parte das praças portuguesas da Índia. A mão de obra não qualificada era composta por escravos dos moradores da fortaleza, sem os quais teria sido impossível concluir a obra.
A praça foi guarnecida, ainda incompleta, em 1583, por um destacamento sob o comando de Nuno Velho Pereira, responsável pela construção dos armazéns e quartéis, conforme uma inscrição epigráfica encontrada sob várias camadas de cal, nos trabalhos de recuperação que tiveram lugar na década de 1960.
O seu comandante, embora subordinado ao Vice-rei da Índia, era o responsável pelo comércio da região do Zambeze.


=== Da Dinastia Filipina ao século XVIII ===

No contexto da Dinastia Filipina, a fortaleza suportou vitoriosa os assaltos neerlandeses em 1604, 1607 e 1608, embora com severos danos às suas muralhas e edifícios, causados pelo intenso fogo da artilharia inimiga. Obras de conservação e reparos foram concluídos em 1620, tendo sofrido ligeiras alterações de traçado, conforme gravura neerlandesa de 1635. A primitiva entrada, rasgada no troço da muralha entre os baluartes de São Gabriel e de Santa Bárbara, voltada para o interior da ilha, que se revelou vulnerável ao fogo da artilharia neerlandesa, foi entaipada e transferida, em algum momento nessa altura, para o troço da muralha entre os baluartes de São Gabriel e de São João. Essa primitiva Porta de Armas foi posta a descoberto em 1945, durante trabalhos realizados pela Comissão dos Monumentos.
Ainda no século XVII, resistiu ao assalto por forças muçulmanas de Mascate em 1669 e novamente em 1704, após a perda do Forte Jesus de Mombaça (1698). Em algum momento no século XVIII, foram-lhe procedidas novas obras de reparo e ampliação, que lhe conferiram o seu actual aspecto e dimensões.
O último ataque à fortaleza foi conduzido por tropas francesas, durante as guerras que se seguiram à Revolução Francesa (1793-1797), ao qual também resistiu, invicta.


=== Do século XX aos nossos dias ===

A Ilha de Moçambique foi classificada como Património Mundial pela UNESCO desde 1991. De acordo com o plano de operações visando à recuperação da Fortaleza de São Sebastião, assinado entre a UNESCO e o Governo de Moçambique em 11 de Dezembro de 2003, em 2007 a UNESCO destinou um milhão e meio de dólares norte-americanos (recursos oriundos dos governos do Japão e da União das Cidades Capitais Luso-Afro-Américo-Asiáticas (UCCLA)) para financiamento das obras.
Ergue-se actualmente em bom estado de conservação, sendo visíveis os restos do antigo reduto (Torre de Moçambique) e, na sua extremidade norte, a Capela de Nossa Senhora do Baluarte, em estilo manuelino, exemplar único de seu tipo no país.


== Características ==

À semelhança da Praça-forte de Mazagão, a Fortaleza de São Sebastião apresenta planta no formato retangular com a extensão de cento e dez metros pelos lados maiores, com quatro baluartes nos vértices, três de formato triangular e um em forma de espigão, sob a invocação de São João, de Nossa Senhora, de São Gabriel e de Santa Bárbara. Deles, a traça do de São Gabriel, o de maiores dimensões, com vinte e quatro canhoneiras, foi consideravelmente alterada, tendo sido demolidos dois dos espigões que davam à fortaleza o aspecto de um polígono estrelado, que se observa em gravuras Neerlandesas do início do século XVII, nomeadamente em 1635.
As suas muralhas assentam na rocha, defrontando-se com o mar pelas faces Norte, Leste e Oeste. Apenas a face Sul, voltada para o lado de terra, permite um assalto.
Em seu auge, a fortaleza disponibilizava quartéis para tropas, capela, hospital e armazéns. As habitações dos oficiais eram assobradadas, sendo o chão dos quartéis e dos armazéns coberto de colmo. No seu interior, destaca-se a cisterna, com capacidade para cerca de duas mil pipas de água. Aberta na década de 1580, foi restaurada em 1605 pelo capitão Sebastião de Macedo e, posteriormente, em outras épocas.

O Satélite de Tecnologia Avançada de Comunicações (ACTS) foi lançado neste missão. Este satélite serviu com um local de teste para conceitos e tecnologia dos satélites de comunicação experimentais. Seu Estágio de Transferência de Órbita (TOS) superior disparou 45 minuto após seu lançamento e levou o satélite a uma órbita geossíncrona no primeiro dia da missão.
A primeira tentativa de lançar o ACTS foi adiada pelo grupo quando as comunicações em duas vias com o Controle da Missão foram perdidas cerca de 30 minutos antes do momento do lançamento. Os controladores de voo podiam recebem telemetria e comunicações de voz do Discovery, porém o grupo não podia receber a comunicação com o controle. O grupo desistiu da entrega do CDT às 2:43 p.m. quando eles não receberam um sinal de ""vai"" do controle da missão como foi combinado nos planos pré-voo feitos para este tipo de ocorrência.
O satélite também foi parte dos sistemas de transmissões da NASA TV que fazia testes de transmissões a longas distâncias. A NASA colocou nos quatro ônibus espaciais oito televisores para que os tripulantes pudessem ver TV do espaço, mais esses equipamentos estava ainda em fase experimental. Somente na STS-58, a missão seguinte, que os tripulantes poderiam ver TV do espaço pela primeira vez na história.
Após a desistência do lançamento, o grupo mudou a banda S do sistema de comunicações do ônibus espacial para uma frequência inferior e então restotou as comunicações em duas vias com o controle em terra. As comunicações em duas vias haviam sido perdidas por um período total de cerca de 45 minutos. Após consultarem o grupo, os controladores de vôo começaram imediatamente a planejar o segundo lançamento, que desta vez foi bem-sucedido.
Outra carga nesta missão foi o telescópio Espectrômetro Ultravioleta Orbitante Recuperável (ORFEUS) montado no Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) do compartimento de carga. O ORFEUS foi projetado para prover informações sobre como as estrelas nascem e como elas morrem, estudando-se as nuvens interestelares gasosas. Também no compartimento de carga estava o experimento Limited Duration Space Environment Candidate Materials Exposure (LDCE).

Durante o lançamento, em 12 de Setembro, do Satélite Avançado de Tecnologia das Comunicações (ACTS) e seu Estágio de Transferência orbital (TOS), dois cordões explosivos Super*Zip, um primário e o outro de suporte, detonaram simultaneamente. Isto causou pequenos danos em duas dúzias de cobertores de isolação montado no espaço entre o compartimento de carga e o compartimento posterior próximo ao #3 APU.
Na quinta-feira, em 16 de Setembro de 1993, os astronautas James Newman e Carl Walz realizaram uma caminhada no espaço designada para avaliar os acessórios, cabos de segurança e uma plataforma com restrição para os pés. Suas descobertas reasseguraram os projetistas do Telescópio Espacial Hubble que suas preparações eram seguras. O novo equipamento projetado para caminhadas no espaço extensas que seria requerido na missão de reparo do telescópio era apenas parte dos objetivos da caminhada no espaço neste dia, e Newman e Walz completaram os outros objetivos conforme eles explicavam ao Controle da missão as diferencias que eles perceberam entre o trabalho em órbita e o treinamento em terra. Ambos os astronautas que participaram da caminhada no espaço estavam adiantados com relação ao planejado neste dia, e então completaram mais trabalhos do que haviam sido originalmente planejado para esta caminhada no espaço.
Entretanto, conforme eles eram limpos, uma tampa emperrada de uma caixa de ferramentas os atrasou quando eles deveriam liberá-la e fecha-la para a viagem de volta da Discovery. A tampa da caixa de ferramentas estendeu a caminhada no espaço em cerca de 45 minutos além do planejado, completando um total de sete horas, cinco minutos e vinte e oito segundos nesta caminhada.
Outras carga a bordo incluiam o Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS), o Experimento de Fotografia Auroral B (APE-B), o Crescimento Comercial de Cristais de Proteína (CPCG), Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space (CHROMEX), o High Resolution Shuttle Glow Spectroscopy-A (HRSGS-A), o IMAX, as Investigações sobre o Procesamento de Membranas de Polímeros (IPMP) e o Equipamento de Monitoramento de Radiação-III (RME-III). O experimento Instegigação dobre o Processamento de Membranas de Polímeros, ou IPMP, foi desenvolvido para pesquisar a combinação de uma série de sistemas de solventes sob a ausência da convecção encontrada na superfície terresre buscando controlar a porosidade de uma série de membranas de polímero. O RME realizou medições dos níveis de raios gama, radiação de elétrons, nêutrons e prótons na cabine do grupo durante o voo.
A bordo, o especialista de missão Newman utilizou um visor especial para realizar um experimento médico testando a visão sob ausência de peso como parte das investigações sobre como a visão compensa a ausência de balanço do ouvido interno no espaço. Newman também testou o receptor do Sistema de Posicionamento Global com sucesso a bordo do Discovery como uma avaliação do uso de tal tipo de equipamento com um suplemento para a navegação dos ônibus espaciais. Além disso, como uma precursors das operações com ônibus espacial, uma das células de combustível do Discovery foi desligada e reiniciada.
Em outra avaliação médica, o comandante Frank Culbertson Jr. e o especialista de missão Daniel Bursch utilizaram uma bicicleta estacionário no compartimento inferior do Discovery como parte de um estudo contínuo a respeito do uso de exercícios físicos para atenuar os efeitos da falta de peso sobre o corpo humano. O grupo também realizou um experimento que buscava aprimorar as membranas de filtragem e checou um outro experimento que estava em execução para o estudo dos efeitos da microgravidade sob as células de plantas.
Os astronautas Carl Walz e Jim Newman operaram um experimento designado para estudar o efeito da luminescência, utilizando um espectrômetro que gravou o efeito em filmes, com grande número de detalhes, e outro que gravava os efeitos em fotografias estáticas. Estes experimentos buscavam obter informações sobre quais tipos de gases, além do oxigênio, produziam luminescência. As informações sobre os tipos de gases nas camadas mais extremas da atmosfera podem ser combinada com o experimento de exposição de materiais realizado no compartimento de carga para auxiliar no projeto e construção de naves espaciais futuras.

1475,"Ramón Novarro, cujo nome verdadeiro era Juan Ramón Gil Samaniego, (Victoria de Durango, Durango, 6 de Fevereiro de 1899 – Hollywood, Califórnia; 30 de Outubro de 1968) foi um ator mexicano que participou de 55 filmes e também trabalhou como roteirista, produtor e diretor.


== Biografia ==
Foi um dos grandes latin lovers do cinema mudo. Nasceu no seio de uma família rica. Seu pai era um dentista que exilou-se em Los Angeles para escapar da Revolução Mexicana em 1913. Primo de Dolores del Rio, começou sua carreira cinematográfica em 1916 dirigido por Cecil B. DeMille e completava sua renda trabalhando como cantor e garçom. Sua mulher, a atriz Alice Terry e o diretor Rex Ingram começaram a promovê-lo como rival de Rudolph Valentino. Ingram sugeriu que ele mudasse seu nome para Novarro. Desde 1923 Ramón começou a atuar em papéis mais importantes. Seu papel em Scaramouche (1923) significou seu primeiro grande sucesso. Em 1925 alcançou o seu maior sucesso como protagonista em Ben-Hur, causando seu vestuário uma grande sensação. Foi aí que Novarro alcançou o estrelato da elite de Hollywood. Com a morte de Valentino em 1926, Novarro se tornou o ator latino mais importantes da mídia.
A mudança do cinema mudo para o sonoro não afetou seu sucesso, especializando-se em musicais. Estava muito interessado em negócios imobiliários e chegou a gastar 10.000 dólares por semana. Em 1934 protagonizou dentro do filme The Cat and the Fiddle a primeira cena de ação real da história do cinema rodada em Technicolor três tiras (já havia rodado algumas cenas no antigo Technicolor de duas tiras dentro de Ben-Hur). No término do seu contrato com a MGM, em 1935, seu cachê começou a cair, trabalhando esporadicamente em filmes de série B e também tentou a sorte na Broadway.

Novarro teve muitos conflitos egodistônicos por ser homossexual e por causa sua criação tradicional na fé católica.
Há rumores de que a MGM tentou conceder a Novarro um casamento de fachada, sendo que o mesmo recusou. No entanto, há quem – incluindo o biógrafo de Novarro, André Soares – que nega que tenha existido tal coerção.


== Morte ==
Ramón Novarro foi assassinado por dois irmãos, os quais havia convidado a uma festa em sua casa para manter relações sexuais, e que trataram de roubá-lo ao acreditarem que mantinha uma grande soma de dinheiro consigo. Depois de torturá-lo, asfixiaram-no e cortaram e o degolaram com uma pequena faca e saquearam sua casa, onde roubaram apenas US$ 20. Está enterrado no Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles).


== Homenagens ==
Novarro tem sua estrela na Calçada da Fama em Hollywood, comemorando sua contribuição à indústria cinematográfica em 6350 Hollywood Boulevard. No final de 2005 o Wings Theatre na cidade de Nova York foi sede da estreia mundial de Through a Naked Lens por George Barthel. A obra combinou fatos e ficção para mostrar a ascensão à fama de Novarro e seu relacionamento com o jornalista hollywoodiano Herbert Howe.

1478,"Bravo! foi uma telenovela brasileira produzida e exibida no horário das 19 horas pela Rede Globo, entre 16 de junho de 1975 e 30 de janeiro de 1976.
Escrita por Janete Clair e Gilberto Braga e dirigida por Fábio Sabag e Reynaldo Boury, substituiu Cuca Legal e foi substituída por Anjo Mau, totalizando 197 capítulos. Produzida em preto-e-branco, foi a 16ª ""novela das sete"" exibida pela emissora.
Teve Carlos Alberto, Aracy Balabanian, Arlete Salles, Cláudio Cavalcanti, Bete Mendes, Marcelo Picchi, Grande Otelo, Heloísa Helena, Ítalo Rossi, Lupe Gigliotti, Luiz Baccelli, Reinaldo Gonzaga, Teresa Cristina Arnaud, Daisy Lúcidi, José Augusto Branco, Neuza Amaral e Carlos Eduardo Dolabella nos papéis principais.


== Enredo ==
O maestro Clóvis Di Lorenzo (Carlos Alberto) é o autor de quatro peças (Romanza, Adagio, Allegro e Fuga) que lhe valeram certo respeito da opinião pública e o status de gênio entre seus pares. Ainda assim, ele é um artista frustrado, que considera seu trabalho medíocre e seu sucesso, uma farsa. Convencido de que as frequentes transmissões de seus concertos por emissoras de televisão são compradas com o dinheiro de sua família, rica e influente, e se julgando bajulado por todos, ele se torna um homem temperamental e solitário. Sua falta de confiança em si mesmo o impede de concluir sua quinta sinfonia, uma obra que ele considera que estará à altura do seu talento e que vai lhe conferir autoafirmação artística.
Clóvis mora numa mansão num bairro nobre do Rio de Janeiro, com a mãe, Marta (Lícia Magna), mulher elegante, porém, triste, infeliz e subjugada; o pai, Guido (Apolo Correia), um homem de boa índole e dono da centenária fábrica de tecidos da família; a filha, Lia (Bete Mendes), jovem bonita e voluntariosa, que herdou do pai o gosto pelas artes, faz balé por vocação. Adorada pela família, é uma moça alegre e feliz que vive de forma intensa suas paixões, sempre fulminantes; e, por fim, a irmã mais velha, Fabiana (Neuza Amaral), uma mulher infeliz, que administra os negócios da família e que, com sua exímia persuasão, cativa a todos. Sente inveja de mulheres bonitas e carrega a frustração de não ter filhos. O irmão acabou ocupando esse papel na vida dela. Fabiana o vê como uma propriedade sua e evoca a imagem de Branca, a falecida esposa de Clóvis e mãe de Lia, quando deseja exercer controle sobre ele.
Clóvis encontra o estímulo para criar quando conhece Cristina Lemos (Aracy Balabanian), uma jovem ingênua recém-chegada do interior do Paraná para trabalhar na conceituada Editora Tigre, que pertence a Edu Ribas (Carlos Eduardo Dolabella), amigo de infância de Clóvis, um homem excêntrico, cercado por amigos interessados em seu dinheiro, que vive com o avarento tio Santiago (Brandão Filho). Inicialmente, ela começa uma amizade com ele movida pela compaixão: desinformada, pensa que o homem amargurado e culto que conheceu na editora é um escritor fracassado. O maestro vê no equívoco uma oportunidade de se relacionar com alguém que não está interessada em adulá-lo, e os dois engatam um namoro. Com o tempo, Clóvis revela sua verdadeira identidade, e os dois se casam, enfrentando a oposição de Fabiana e Lia. Porém, o casamento não resolve a insegurança e as inquietações de Clóvis, que, de uma hora para outra, resolve desaparecer e levar uma vida anônima, fingindo ser um mendigo. Assim, conhece três pessoas que o ensinam a importância dos sentimentos e valores humanos sobre o status ou a riqueza. São elas: Myrian (Arlete Salles), Malaquias (Grande Otelo) e Maurício (Cláudio Cavalcanti).
Myrian Serpa é a secretária de Edu e que é secretamente apaixonada pelo patrão. Ajudou Cristina quando esta começou a trabalhar na editora, chegando a dividir o apartamento com ela. A educação precária que recebera na infância se reflete em seu comportamento espalhafatoso. Com o objetivo de vencer na vida, casou-se com um homem rico. A morte do marido, no entanto, a deixou desamparada, obrigando-a a entregar a filha, Sheila (Teresa Cristina Arnaud), aos avós paternos a fim de garantir a educação da jovem. Sheila, por sua vez, tornou-se uma jovem mimada, que sente vergonha do comportamento da mãe e é dominada pela avó Eugênia Arantes (Heloísa Helena), uma senhora viúva, arrogante, prepotente e preconceituosa que faz de tudo para piorar a relação entre elas. No final, com a ajuda de Clóvis, mãe e filha se reconciliam e passam a ter uma saudável relação. Além disso, Myrian se casa com Edu.
Malaquias é o motorista de Edu. Divertido e carismático, salva o patrão das situações mais embaraçosas. Mora num sobrado com a atrapalhada cartomante Dona Alcinda (Joyce de Oliveira), a única que sabe do disfarce de Clóvis. Tem o costume de fazer economia com o salário que recebe para poder viajar e morar num lugar melhor. No fim, Malaquias consegue pôr em prática seus sonhos contando com a ajuda financeira do maestro.
E Maurício, jovem pianista que tem pavor de palco. Aos 8 anos foi reconhecido pela crítica como garoto-prodígio, empolgando as mais exigentes plateias. O passado brilhante, no entanto, passou a ser um grande fardo em sua vida, uma vez que crescera e se tornara apenas um bom pianista. Sua mãe, Dalva (Lupe Gigliotti), o martiriza constantemente, pois deseja manter o reconhecimento triunfal do filho. Clóvis passa a viver um tempo em sua casa e o ajuda a se livrar do jugo materno e a se tornar um grande profissional.
A experiência adquirida ajuda Clóvis a renovar sua autoconfiança, seu equilíbrio e seu talento. Revigorado, ele reata com Cristina, que, nesse meio tempo, teve um rápido envolvimento com Edu, e é confortado pela família. Por fim, se apresenta no Teatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro executando o Grand finale, a quinta sinfonia de sua autoria.
Há também a história de Henrique (Marcelo Picchi), conhecido como Rick, jovem líder de uma banda de rock que pretende cursar Astronomia na faculdade. É apaixonado por Lia, mas não pode ficar com ela, por empecilhos arquitetados por Fabiana. Fora criado pelo professor Paes Duarte (Ítalo Rossi), maestro agradável e primeiro mestre de Clóvis, mas tenta de todas as formas provar que é filho de Edu Ribas e que fora abandonado ainda pequeno.
Há o drama de Loretta (Daisy Lúcidi), a Lolô, pianista gaúcha e melhor amiga de Clóvis, que vive numa cadeira de rodas e precisa enfrentar o preconceito no meio artístico. Envolve-se com Ronaldo (José Augusto Branco), mais novo que ela, um pianista sedutor.
Outros personagens importantes na trama são: Jorge (Reynaldo Gonzaga), irmão de Branca, a primeira mulher de Clóvis, que é um homem contido, sério e honesto. Seu maior objetivo é decifrar a morte da irmã. Mas, para isso, precisa enfrentar os obstáculos impostos por Fabiana; Alice (Bibi Vogel), jovem empregada da família de Clóvis junto com sua mãe, a governanta Noêmia (Mary Daniel), e que cresceu apaixonada por ele, porém, acaba se envolvendo com Jorge; e Nelson Bávaro (Luiz Baccelli), executivo na fábrica de tecidos da família de Clóvis. É um homem ambicioso e perspicaz que, quase sempre, consegue o que quer, sobretudo com as mulheres. Sabe que Fabiana é apaixonada por ele e usa isso ao seu favor, sendo o único que consegue dominá-la.

== Curiosidades ==
Em 1975, Janete Clair foi escalada para escrever uma nova novela às 19h, que seria Bravo! - aliás, única novela da autora nesse horário. Este fato a deixou meio desprestigiada por largar o horário das 20h, que a consagrou, para trabalhar em outro que considerava mais leve. Magoada, achava que tinha sido rebaixada e nunca engoliu essa mudança. Porém, como grande telenovelista que era, transformou Bravo! num enorme sucesso de audiência.
Janete Clair teve de abandonar Bravo! por volta do capítulo 106, quando a telenovela Roque Santeiro foi censurada às vésperas de estrear. Não havia nenhuma sinopse pronta para ir ao ar, e a autora, conhecida pela capacidade de improvisar e criar com prazos curtos, foi convocada para escrever uma trama substituta que aproveitasse o elenco da novela censurada. O texto da novela foi Pecado Capital, um dos seus maiores sucessos na televisão. Confiou ao então iniciante Gilberto Braga escrever os capítulos restantes de Bravo!, com sua supervisão semanal.
Fabiana, irmã de Clóvis, sofreu uma cirurgia na trama, e cenas reais de uma operação plástica a que a própria atriz se submeteu na época, efetuadas pelo cirurgião plástico Paulo Barbosa, foram levadas ao ar para dar veracidade ao episódio. Na Casa da Mãe Pobre, Fábio Sabag dirigiu a cena que foi ao ar no capítulo 115, em 27 de outubro de 1975. ""Apenas Elizabeth Taylor, em um filme de que não lembro o nome, fez uma cirurgia na realidade como se fosse a própria personagem”, diz com orgulho Neuza.
Carlos Alberto revela por que foi convidado para esse papel: ""Eu estava fora da TV há dois anos, mas, como tinha conhecimento de música clássica, a Janete me fez o convite e resolvi voltar."" Tanto foi que o ator ensaiou com Júlio Medaglia as marcações de um maestro durante a execução das peças apresentadas na novela, e atuou em todas as cenas sem o auxílio de dublês.
Como um concerto, a trama dividiu-se em cinco partes, correspondentes aos movimentos da sinfonia criada pelo protagonista: Romanza, Adagio, Allegro, Fuga e Gran Finale. A mudança de um movimento para outro se fazia com o aparecimento de uma nova partitura no vídeo.
Janete Clair planejava um final trágico para Clóvis Di Lorenzo. Gilberto Braga deu continuidade à sinopse da autora e, no fim, desejou matá-lo. Mas nenhum dos dois conseguiram escapar do melodrama característico das 19h: a produção da Rede Globo, a pedido do público, impôs um final feliz ao maestro. Em 1980, Janete declarou: ""(...) Bravo! também não teve o sucesso que eu esperava. No entanto, até hoje lembro dessa novela com muita saudade, porque eu lidava com música, que é algo que eu adoro.""
Bravo! foi adaptada para o Chile em 1989 com o título homônimo.

1492,"O Floripa Esporte Clube, também conhecido como Super Imperatriz Vôlei, foi uma equipe brasileira de voleibol masculino da cidade de Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. Disputava a Superliga Série A. Até 2012 era conhecido como Cimed Esporte Clube.


== Histórico ==
O Grupo Cimed, após retirar seu patrocínio da equipe da Unisul montou em 2005 um novo time na cidade de Florianópolis:  o Cimed Esporte Clube, gerenciado e treinado por Renan dal Zotto. Em sua primeira temporada a equipe conquistou o título da Liga Nacional, o vice-campeonato catarinense e surpreendeu quando conquistou a Superliga 2005/2006 ao vencer a série melhor de cinco contra o Telemig Celular/Minas por 3 vitórias a 2, sendo a última delas conquistada no ginásio do Mineirinho. 
Na temporada seguinte a equipe conquistou pela primeira vez o campeonato catarinense [carece de fontes?] e na Superliga 2006/2007 terminou com o vice-campeonato ao perder a série melhor de cinco por 3 a 1 para o Telemig Celular/Minas.  A equipe retomou ao topo do pódio da competição nacional na temporada seguinte, vencendo novamente o Minas, desta vez em jogo único, por 3 sets a 2.  Na quarta final consecutiva contra o Minas veio o tricampeonato da equipe de Florianópolis, novamente em jogo único vencido por 3 a 0. 
O ano de 2009 reservou grandes desafios para a equipe catarinense. A Cimed conquistou o tricampeonato catarinense, pela primeira vez sem enfrentar a Unisul na decisão. [carece de fontes?] Os comandados de Marcos Pacheco ainda conquistaram o Sul-Americano de Clubes ao bater o Brasil Vôlei Clube no tie-break da final.  Com essa conquista a equipe se qualificou para o Mundial de Clubes, disputado no Catar. Em sua estreia no torneio mundial os brasileiros foram derrotados pelo Paykan Teerã (1-3).  Na segunda rodada a equipe se reabilitou ao vencer o Al-Arabi Doha (3-1),  mas não conseguiu passar pelo forte time polonês do PGE Skra Belchatów (1-3) sendo eliminada na primeira fase do torneio.  Na Superliga, pela primeira vez sem duelar contra o Minas na final, o time conseguiu seu quarto triunfo ao superar facilmente o estreante Bonsucesso/Montes Claros por 3 sets a zero. 
Em 2010 a equipe conquistou o tetracampeonato catarinense, consolidando sua hegemonia no estado. [carece de fontes?] Mais uma vez qualificada para o Sul-Americano de Clubes a equipe decepcionou ao ser derrotada na decisão pelo Drean Bolívar, da Argentina, no tie-break e ficou de fora do Mundial de clubes daquele ano.  Na Superliga, após uma boa primeira fase na qual terminou na segunda colocação,  a equipe foi surpreendida nas quartas-de-final pelo Vôlei Futuro, sétimo colocado, perdendo a série melhor de três por 2 a 0 e sendo eliminada do torneio de maneira precoce. 
Com o fim da equipe de voleibol masculino do Pinheiros a Cimed recebeu o apoio da Sky e pela primeira vez pode contar com estrelas do voleibol, como Giba e Gustavo.  Porém, devido a um problema de fratura por estresse na tíbia, Giba não pode disputar nenhum jogo pela equipe catarinense.  Após terminar a primeira fase na terceira colocação a equipe decepcionou novamente e foi eliminada novamente nas quartas-de-final; desta vez pelo Vivo/Minas, maior rival da maior parte de suas conquistas da Superliga. 
O resultado obtido na temporada 2011/2012, juntamente com o fraco desempenho do Pinheiros/Sky nas duas temporadas anteriores, levou a Sky a retirar seu patrocínio ao voleibol.  A equipe ficou então com o futuro incerto, provocando seu desmanche com a saída de diversos jogadores para outros clubes, como Giba (para o Personal Bolívar, da Argentina  ), Gustavo (para o Canoas Vôlei ), Éder (para o Sesi-SP), entre outros.  Em 20 de abril de 2012 o Grupo Cimed anunciou o fim de seus investimentos na equipe de voleibol.  
Após um período de incertezas o projeto gerenciado por Renan dal Zotto conseguiu o apoio da rede Supermercados Imperatriz, surgindo assim o Super Imperatriz Vôlei.

1493,"Melech Mechaya é um quinteto português de música klezmer, tradicionalmente judaica, com inspirações nas músicas cigana, árabe e dos balcãs.


== Biografia ==
Em 2006, João Graça, Miguel Veríssimo, André Santos, João Novais e Francisco Caiado formaram aquela que veio a ser considerada como a primeira e mais proeminente banda portuguesa de música Klezmer. Começando por explorar temas tradicionais judaicos, os Melech Mechaya estreiam-se em palcos na noite de 10 de Março 2007. Em 2008 lançam em edição de autor o seu EP de estreia ""Melech Mechaya"", que incluía já alguns temas originais, e no mesmo ano o grupo dá os seus primeiros passos internacionais com vários espectáculos em Espanha.
Em 2009 lançam pela editora Ovação seu primeiro longa-duração Budja Ba, que conta com a participação das Tucanas. A digressão de apresentação de Budja Ba inclui importantes festivais como o Festival de Músicas do Mundo de Sines, Festival Bons Sons, CCB Fora de Si, Festa do Avante!, Super Bock Surf Fest ou a abertura do concerto de Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra no Coliseu dos Recreios, em Lisboa. Fora de portas os Melech Mechaya actuam no festival Špancirfest na Croácia, e encabeçam vários festivais em Espanha, onde partilham palco com Kroke e Portico Quartet.
Em Março de 2010 participam e fazem a direcção musical da peça Ivanov, de Anton Tchekhov, encenada pela companhia de teatro A Truta no Teatro Maria Matos em Lisboa. Esta peça serviu de inspiração para o novo registo discográfico, que intitular-se-ia Aqui Em Baixo Tudo É Simples, e que seria lançado pela Ponto Zurca em Outubro de 2011. Este novo trabalho conta com convidados como a fadista Mísia ou o trompetista norte-americano Frank London, vencedor de um Grammy em 2006 com os Klezmatics. A digressão de apresentação desde novo álbum arrancou na Casa da Música, no Porto, e incluiu 21 teatros de todo o país. Além destes espectáculos, os Melech Mechaya actuaram ainda em festivais como o Rock In Rio Lisboa, Maré De Agosto, ou Guimarães 2012 - Capital Europeia da Cultura, num espectáculo com a participação da companhia de teatro catalã La Fura Dels Baus. A carreira internacional conhece novos desenvolvimentos, e os Melech Mechaya fazem digressões em Espanha, Brasil e Cabo Verde. Em Maio de 2012 Aqui Em Baixo Tudo É Simples é editado internacionalmente pela Felmay, e em Março de 2013 é nomeado para melhor disco instrumental de 2012 nos Independent Music Awards.

1495,"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 é o sétimo álbum de estúdio, o quinto lançado mundialmente e o segundo álbum de língua inglesa da cantora e compositora colombiana Shakira, lançado em 28 de novembro de 2005 pela Epic Records. Após alcançar sucesso internacional com seu primeiro álbum de estúdio gravado em inglês, Laundry Service (2001), Shakira decidiu criar um disco de acompanhamento em duas partes. Ela lançou o projeto como um acompanhamento de seu sexto disco de carreira Fijación Oral, Vol. 1. Com a qual alcançou sucesso internacional cinco meses antes. Como co-produtora, Shakira escolheu produtores, incluindo seus colaboradores anteriores Gustavo Cerati, Lester Mendez, Luis Fernando Ochoa e Rick Rubin, para trabalhar junto com novos parceiros Jerry Duplessis, Wyclef Jean, Tim Mitchell e The Matrix.
Musicalmente, o álbum segue o estilo de suas obras anteriores, sendo fortemente influenciado por estilos pop latinos e além disso, incorpora elementos de dance-pop, pop rock e trip hop. Após o seu lançamento, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 recebeu comentários em sua maioria favoráveis ​​dos críticos de música, que o elogiaram como seu projeto mais forte até hoje. O álbum estreou no número cinco no Billboard 200 dos EUA, com vendas na primeira semana de 128.000 cópias, o álbum foi posteriormente certificado de platina pela Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) e vendeu mais de 1,7 milhão de unidades no país. Além disso, entrou nas paradas da Dinamarca e no México.
Três singles foram lançados do álbum. O primeiro ""Don't Bother"", alcançou o número quarenta e dois no Billboard Hot 100 dos EUA. O segundo single, ""Hips Don't Lie"", foi incluído na reedição do álbum depois de atingir o topo da parada americana, tornando-se seu primeiro single a conseguir esse feito. O terceiro e último single, ""Illegal"", alcançou o número um no quadro de componentes da Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. Em dezembro de 2006, os álbuns foi reeditado como uma versão expandida, intitulado Oral Fixation Volumes 1&2. Os projetos foram adicionalmente promovidos através da Oral Fixation Tour, que percorreu por vários países ao longo de 2006 e 2007.


== Antecedentes ==

Após alcançar sucesso internacional em 2001 com seu primeiro álbum gravado em inglês, Laundry Service, Shakira decidiu lançar um material em língua espanhola como o seu acompanhamento, sendo seu primeiro álbum gravado totalmente em espanhol desde Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998). Tendo co-composto quase sessenta canções para o projeto, ela decidiu dividir o lançamento em dois volumes, colocando-se ""na missão de selecionar as [suas] canções favoritas"" para gravar. Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 contém todas as músicas em espanhol e Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 apresenta todas as faixas em língua inglesa. Shakira inicialmente disse que o segundo volume teria um ""repertório de canções completamente novo"", apesar do álbum completo ter incluído duas versões em inglês de duas faixas do primeiro disco. Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 foi relançado em 2006 com uma nova ordem de faixas e incluiu ""Hips Don't Lie"", com a participação de Wyclef Jean e que se tornou um sucesso mundial. Durante a gravação de ambos os álbuns, ela trabalhou com os colaboradores de longa data Lester Mendez e Luis Fernando Ochoa e novos parceiros, incluindo Gustavo Cerati e Jose ""Gocho"" Torres.
Para o álbum, Shakira escreveu todas as letras e a maioria das músicas. ""Estou ansiosa para começar a ver as primeiras reações das pessoas e como as pessoas começam a se relacionar com essas músicas e apreciando todos os trabalhos que fiz nos últimos dois anos, é a melhor recompensa que um artista pode ter depois de tanto trabalho duro"", diz Shakira. ""Eu não vou mentir para você, não foi um mar de rosas. Às vezes, era doloroso criar dois álbuns, escrever mais de 60 músicas e lutar contra minhas próprias inseguranças e dúvidas"". Ao falar sobre a diferença em cantar em espanhol e inglês, Shakira disse: ""Quando eu canto em espanhol, encontro elementos que me ajudam a expressar uma ideia talvez diferente do que quando eu faço isso em inglês. Existem diferentes estéticas, mas lá é um certo estilo para a forma como eu escrevo minhas próprias músicas, uma maneira particular de descrever sentimentos e emoções que desenvolvi, durante todos esses anos fazendo músicas. Entrei em contato com meu próprio presente - estou certa, há 10 anos, Eu não estava meio tão boa como eu posso dizer que estou hoje e ainda não sou boa o suficiente. Há um longo caminho a ser percorrido.""


== Arte da capa ==

As capas dos discos Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 e Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 foram inspiradas por Eva, a primeira mulher; Shakira disse: ""[eu queria] atribuir a Eva mais uma razão para morder o fruto proibido, que seria sua fixação oral"" e que ""[ela sempre pareceu] uma pessoa muito oral. [É a] maior fonte de prazer [dela]"". A capa do primeiro disco apresenta Shakira segurando uma menina em seus braços; a arte da capa do segundo volume apresenta Shakira nua (coberta por galhos de árvores), com a criança sentada na árvore. Ela afirmou que ambas as capas aludiram a teoria do psicanalista Sigmund Freud de que as crianças começam a descobrir o mundo através de suas bocas durante o estágio oral do desenvolvimento psicossexual.
Para Jon Pareles, periodista do The New York Times, ""por razões óbvias, a capa do álbum Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 é atraente"". Na versão do álbum comercializada no Oriente Médio, Shakira foi coberta por folhas. A revista Complex elegeu a capa de Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 como a décima primeira capa de álbum mais sensual de todos os tempos, escrevendo que é ""o retrato mais quente de Eva no Jardim do Éden que podemos imaginar"". A publicação Maxin também listou a capa do álbum como uma das mais sensuais de todos os tempos, escrevendo que ""a menina nua segurando uma maçã em um jardim é interpretada, mas não quando a menina tem o rebolado nos quadris como Shakira. Puxa, isso poderia acontecer novamente, não poderia?"".


== Composição ==
Para Stephen Thomas Erlewine do AllMusic, o álbum toca em tudo, desde os esperados ritmos latinos, até a eurodisco, rock & roll e o britpop, todos pontuados por alguns confessionários rígidos. ""How Do You Do"" é uma faixa de abertura ousada que apresenta cantos gregorianos e uma recitação misteriosa de ""The Lord's Prayer"", antes de empurrar o ouvinte para uma música semelhante a ""Dear God"" de Sarah McLachlan, de acordo com Kristina Weise do Songwriting Universe. Ele apresenta perguntas amargas em relação à fé e religião. As letras dizem: ""Quantas pessoas morrem e machucam em seu nome? / Ei, isso faz você se orgulhar, ou isso te causa vergonha?"", Shakira afirma: ""Eu decidi na ponte da canção incluir cantos de diferentes religiões como o Islã, Judaísmo e cristianismo. E os três cantores dizem basicamente o mesmo: estão pedindo perdão"", afirmou. O primeiro single, ""Don't Bother"", apresenta o capítulo final de um relacionamento e a confusão que enfrenta qualquer pessoa durante o termino. Inclui as linhas líricas: ""Por você, eu desistiria de tudo o que tenho e me mudaria para um país comunista. Se você viesse comigo, é claro / E cortaria minhas unhas para não te machucar"". Ela segue rapidamente com: ""E afinal de contas fico feliz por não ser seu tipo / Eu prometo que você não vai me ver chorar / Então não se preocupe / eu vou ficar bem, eu vou ficar bem"". Para Shakira, ""acho que ""Don't Bother"", tem muita dor nela como uma música, mas também muito humor e sarcasmo. Sim, é uma maneira de exorcizar todos esses sentimentos, uma forma de catarse, Eliminando todas essas emoções que torturam nos mulheres em algum momento de nossas vidas "".
""Illegal"" apresenta um solo de guitarra do guitarrista mexicano Carlos Santana e apresenta letras como ""Você disse que você me amaria até morrer / E, até onde eu sei, você ainda está vivo"", que foi comparado com Alanis Morissette na canção ""You Oughta Know"", de acordo com Stephen Thomas Erlewine do AllMusic. ""Eu gostaria de ser a proprietária do zíper da sua calça jeans"", ela canta com raiva ""Hey You"", que foi comparada às obras da banda de rock americana No Doubt, pela Slant Magazine. O som de Mariachi se recuperam contra as guitarras de surf em ""Animal City"", uma advertência contra a fama e amigos falsos; Enquanto os acentos da bossa nova atravessam ""Something"", uma das únicas duas faixas repetidas do Fijación Oral, Vol. 1, sendo intitulado de En Tus Pupilas na primeira edição. Enquanto ""The Day and the Time"" está na primeira edição, com o título ""Dia Especial"". Enquanto isso, o violão de carambola e o guitarrista de carabina completam ""Your Embrace"", uma balada, adult contemporary, enquanto ""Costume Does the Clown"", fala sobre promessas sentimentais não cumpridas. Shakira também mergulha em um neo-disco pulsante na faixa de encerramento ""Timor"", mas em forma de protesto.


== Recepção da critica ==
No Metacritic, que atribui uma classificação normal de 100, às críticas dos críticos mainstream, a ""Oral Fixation"", recebeu uma pontuação média de 74 com base em 15 críticas, indicando uma ""revisões em sua maioria favorável"". Stephen Thomas Erlewine do AllMusic, deu ao álbum uma classificação de 4 estrelas (dentro de 5), chamando-a de ""um álbum de pop/rock muito serio e ambicioso, com certeza não pop-rock frívolo, [...] é pop, mas não é convencional "". Erlewine também escreveu que Oral Fixation, ""não é apenas um álbum marcantemente diferente da Fijación Oral, Vol. 1, mas de todos os outros discos do seu catálogo - ou mais importante, de que qualquer outro álbum pop de 2005"". Matt Cibula do PopMatters, concordou, escrevendo que a Oral Fixation é ""o melhor disco pop do ano"". Alexis Petridis, do The Guardian, escreveu que ""A Oral Fixation é o som de uma voz totalmente única em um mundo uniforme"". Agustin Gurza de Los Angeles Times escreveu o álbum ""é um trabalho mais forte como um todo, com as partes mais nítidas e mais escuras se sobressaindo"", louvando sua música, escrevendo que ""este trabalho se mantém sozinho, diretamente dentro do mainstream do pop e rock dos EUA, com muito menos sabor latino"".
David Browne, do Entertainment Weekly, deu ao álbum uma classificação B, escrevendo que: ""Embora a Oral Fixation não seja a primeira vez que um artista latino, tenha apontado diretamente para o mercado norte-americano e quase tenha se perdido no meio do caminho, É um dos mais decepcionantes. Em todos os ingredientes musicais à sua disposição, Shakira termina com um prato relativamente suave."" Sal Cinquemani da Slant Magazine escreveu que a parte mais fraca em algumas músicas do álbum são"" principalmente os ganchos, uma tentativa de acessibilidade de rádio que lava a personalidade que separa Shakira de suas concorrentes."" Barry Walters da Rolling Stone, reconheceu que ""Ocasionalmente, é desajeitado, mas em sua maioria inteligente, as letras e performances inglesas de Shakira, ainda demonstram a falta de confiança de suas faixas espanholas, mas a Oral Fixation, consegue manter a credibilidade musical que a Fijacion Oral tinha conquistado"". Edward Oculicz da Stylus Magazine, concluiu que ""o volume de Oral Fixation Volume 2, atinge um bom balão entre a audácia criativa de suas músicas mais extremas, todas as quais funcionam como um bom pop bem preenchido, que é bem trabalhado e atrativo"".


== Desempenho comercial ==

Nos Estados Unidos, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, estreou no número cinco na Billboard 200, com vendas na primeira semana de 128.000 cópias. Depois de ser relançado em 2006 com ""Hips Don't Lie"" e uma versão alternativa de ""La Tortura"", o disco passou do número noventa e oito para o número seis. Com vendas de 81.000 cópias naquela semana, experimentou um aumento de 643%. Em 2007, o álbum vendeu mais de 1,7 milhões de unidades no país. O álbum foi certificado de platina pela RIAA nos Estados Unidos. Shakira recebeu 18 certificações de platina pelas vendas de Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, nos seguintes países: Canadá, México, Áustria, Alemanha, Hungria, Itália, Noruega, Portugal, Espanha, Suíça, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Índia, Grécia, Estados Unidos, Reino Unido e no seu país de origem, Colômbia. Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 foi nomeado o nono álbum mais vendido de 2006 em todo o mundo. Também foi o 23º álbum mais vendido nos Estados Unidos de 2006. Após o desempenho de ""Hips Do not Lie"" no MTV Video Music Awards de 2006, que apresentou Shakira dançando em uma roupa indiana, o álbum liderou na parada da Índia e foi certificado de platina vendendo 80 mil unidades. Em abril de 2007, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 voltou a entrar no UK Albums Chart no n.°70, na mesma semana em que ""Beautiful Liar"", o duo de Shakira com Beyoncé, entrou nos gráficos de singles no n.°10, apenas através de downloads.

A Perigosa Batalha Sangrenta?) Dragon Ball Z: O Poder Invencível (título no Brasil) ou Dragon Ball Z: Uma Batalha Ardente (título em Portugal) é o oitavo filme de Dragon Ball Z, publicado pela primeira vez no dia 6 de março de 1993, entre os episódios 176 e 177. A dublagem brasileira foi feita pelo estúdio Álamo. A popularidade do antagonista Broly rendeu duas sequências: Kiken na futari! Super senshi wa nemurenai e Super senshi gekiba!! Katsu no wa ore da.


== Enredo ==
Enquanto Goku e Chichi fazem uma entrevista para matricular Gohan em uma escola, os outros personagens se divertem em um piquenique. Em seu planeta, o Senhor Kaioh sente uma grande destruição vinda da Galáxia Sul. O piquenique é interrompido quando uma nave pousa no local. Dela surge um Saiyajin chamado Paragas, que corre até Vegeta chamado-o de rei. Ele convida Vegeta para ser o rei do Novo Planeta Vegeta e pede sua ajuda para derrotar o Lendário Super Saiyajin. Apesar de ter suas suspeitas de que o Lendário Super Saiyajin realmente exista, Vegeta aceita a proposta. Ele é acompanhado por Gohan, Kuririn, Mestre Kame, Oolong e o Trunks do Futuro. O Senhor Kaioh contacta Goku mentalmente e este se teletransporta para seu planeta. Após uma grande refeição Goku se teletransporta para a Galáxia Sul em busca do indivíduo que a está destruindo. Chegando no Novo Planeta Vegeta, Paragas introduz a todos seu filho Broly. Algum tempo depois, Vegeta e Broly partem em busca do Lendário Super Saiyajin enquanto Gohan, Kuririn e Trunks exploram o planeta. Eles se surpreendem ao ver que a única área bem construída é o palácio real e seus arredores. Gohan e Kuririn também descobrem que os trabalhadores locais vieram do planeta Shamo e são mantidos escravos pelos soldados de Paragas. Seguindo o Ki do Lendário Super Saiyajin, Goku aparece no Novo Planeta Vegeta e se encontra com os outros. Durante a noite Vegeta e Broly retornam ao palácio. Broly se enfurece ao ver Goku mas se acalma quando seu pai ativa um misterioso aparelho. Preocupado, Paragas leva o aparelho até um de seus cientistas para se certificar que ele não está com defeito. Após a manutenção é revelado, através de um flashback de Paragas, que Broly nasceu com um poder descomunal que superava inúmeros Saiyajins experientes. Com o passar dos anos, Broly tinha dificuldades em controlar esse poder e por isso sofreu de constantes ataques de fúria. Para controlar seu filho, Paragas construiu um dispositivo que suprimi o Ki e colocou na cabeça de Broly. O aparelho que Paragas carrega é o controle que ativa o dispositivo. Após algum tempo de refleção, Paragas se lembra que Goku e Broly nasceram no mesmo dia e Goku não deixava o Broly dormir por causa de seu choro. Paragas chega a conclusão de que foi o choro de Goku que atormentou Broly por toda a sua vida.
Na madrugada, Broly invade o quarto dos Guerreiros Z e ataca Goku. Os dois batalham até que Paragas aparece e acalma seu filho. Os dois retornam ao palácio e Goku percebe que o Ki do Broly é o mesmo Ki do Lendário Super Saiyajin. Na manhã seguinte, Vegeta se prepara para voltar para a Terra com seus companheiros. Gohan, Kuririn e Trunks contam a Vegeta que todo o planeta está em ruínas e trazem os habitantes de Shamo para irem embora com eles. Antes que os Guerreiros pudessem partir, Broly se enfurece novamente e se transforma no Lendário Super Saiyajin, provocando a quebra do dispositivo em sua cabeça devido a sobrecarga de energia. Ele então começa a lutar contra Goku, Gohan e Trunks enquanto Vegeta entra em um estado de choque. Paragas se aproxima dele e conta que os levou até o Novo Planeta Vegeta para que realizar sua vingança contra seu pai, o Rei Vegeta. Poucos depois de Broly nascer, no dia em que Freeza explodiu o Planeta Vegeta, o Rei Vegeta viu Broly como uma ameaça ao seu império e por isso atacou Paragas e perfurou a barriga de Broly, deixando os dois para morrerem pela perda de sangue. Contudo, Broly conseguiu criar uma esfera de energia que ele usou para fugir do planeta enquanto carregava seu pai. Ele também revela que o Novo Planeta Vegeta está prestes a colidir com um cometa, Camori. Sem muito esforço, Broly derrota seus oponentes. Piccolo, que chegou no planeta com uma nave, salva os três e os entrega algumas Sementes dos Deuses. A batalha recomeça mas Broly continua vencendo. Vegeta se recupera após conversar com Piccolo e se junta a luta. Paragas percebe que seu filho se tornou incontrolável e decidi fugir em uma nave-casulo, mas Broly estrassalha a nave com Paragas dentro e a arremessa no cometa Camori. O único guerreiro que resta de pé é Goku. Ele reúne a energia restante de Gohan, Trunks e Piccolo mas se recusa a atacar enquanto não obter a de Vegeta. O cometa Camori se aproxima do planeta e Vegeta entrega sua energia a Goku. Broly e Goku se atacam simultaneamente e Goku atinge o local onde Broly foi ferido pelo Rei Vegeta. Goku lança seu Ki dentro de Broly e ele aparentemente explode. O cometa Camori colide com o Novo Planeta Vegeta mas Goku utiliza seu teletransporte para levar todos até a nave de Piccolo e eles retornam para a Terra. Goku e Gohan vão para casa onde encontram Chichi furiosa por Goku ter saído durante a entrevista.

Ele então constrói o aparelho que controla o Ki de Broly e começa sua vingança. Ele também pretendia dominar a Terra por causa de seu ambiente agradável.

1507,"Inimutaba é um município brasileiro do estado de Minas Gerais. Sua população estimada em 2014 pelo IBGE era de 7.349 habitantes. Fica a 6 km de Curvelo, a maior cidade da região.
Sua história começou no século XIX com a construção ali de uma indústria de tecelagem com o nome de Fiação e Tecelagem Cedro e Cachoeira, que aliás era o nome mais comum de Inimutaba, que na linguagem indígena significa ""aldeia de tecelão"". Sua emancipação deu-se em 1961 quando deixou de ser comarca de Curvelo. Passada à condição de cidade, seu primeiro prefeito foi o senhor José Marcos, um dos melhores e mais populares prefeitos de sua breve história.
Durante quase cem anos sua vida girou em torno da pequena indústria de tecelagem que fabricava o chamado ""americano cru"", que era enviado para outra filial em Sete Lagoas, onde recebia tingimento e estampa. O garimpo do cristal foi muito forte durante muitos anos, mas está quase extinto na atualidade. A fábrica foi desativada no início dos anos 90 deixando a pequena cidade em polvorosa. Aos poucos, no entanto, a população foi se adequando à nova realidade. Hoje há várias atividades na cidade; a antiga indústria foi reativada e hoje é a principal unidade fabril do grupo Sertex, grupo esse que possui mais duas unidades, uma em Cachoeira da Prata - Mimas Gerais e outra em Vila Velha - Espírito Santo; o comércio melhorou; há serviços básicos de infraestrutura, um pequeno posto médico; escola, farmácia, um posto bancário, escola colegial; ruas asfaltadas, entre outros.
O destaque da cidade atualmente é o ""Forró de Inimutaba"", que acontece no fim do mês de julho. É uma festa que já virou tradição na região.
Outro destaque é o surgimento da banda juvenil Agrotóxicos, que, antônimamente ao seu nome, cantava músicas com o tema de ecologia. Fizeram sucesso instantâneo entre a região, sendo chamados rapidamente para tocar em outros eventos como o ""forró do padre"".

1529,"A Igreja Presbiteriana Evangélica - IPE ( em inglês Evangelical Presbyterian Church - EPC ) é um denominação cristã americana, de governo presbiteriano e teologia Reformada, expressa em um ortodoxo visão conservadora. O lema da Igreja Evangélica Presbiteriana é ""Nas coisas essenciais, unidade, nas não-essenciais, liberdade; em todas as coisas caridade; a verdade no amor "" O Gabinete da Assembleia Geral está localizado em Livônia, Michigan , perto de Detroit .


== História ==
A IPE começou como resultado de reuniões de oração em 1980 e 1981 por pastores e anciãos cada vez mais influenciados pelo Teologia liberal no ramo ""norte"" do presbiterianismo (a Igreja Presbiteriana nos Estados Unidos , antecessora da Igreja Presbiteriana (EUA) ). Dois eventos serviram como catalisadores importantes em sua separação: o caso de Kenyon de 1975 e o de Kaseman de Winn em 1981. Kenyon era um graduado do seminário que, de boa consciência declarou que iria recusar-se a participar na ordenação de uma mulher, embora tenha afirmado que ele estaria disposto a servir em um pastorado com mulheres ordenadas na pauta. Embora ele tinha sido ordenado pelo Presbitério de Pittsburgh, em 1975, a Comissão Permanente Judiciária da Assembleia Geral da Igreja Presbiteriana Unida nos Estados Unidos da América derrubou a ordenação de Kenyon porque a aceitação de ordenação feminina era ""uma disposição constitucional explícita."" Seis anos mais tarde, o presbitério de Maryland permitiu Mansfield Kaseman(da Igreja Unida de Cristo) tornar-se de uma das suas igrejas. Os presbiterianos conservadores o acusavam de negar a Divindade de Cristo.
A primeira assembleia geral da Igreja reuniram-se na Igreja Presbiteriana Evangélica de Ward, nos subúrbios de Detroit , Michigan no final de 1981, para a elaboração de uma lista de crenças essenciais. Esta lista foi intencionalmente curto, a fim de ajudar a preservar a unidade da Igreja em torno dos pontos essenciais da fé na teologia, o governo da igreja, e evangelismo. Na sua fundação, a IPE aprovou uma lista de crenças essenciais, ""Os fundamentos da nossa fé"", para indicar o que os pontos de vista da IPE como a condição sine qua non do cristianismo evangélico, em parte para tentar garantir que não faria sucumbir aos problemas teológicos que atormentaram suas denominações mãe durante a controvérsia fundamentalista-modernista. ""The Essentials"" é uma versão mais completa dos Cinco fundamentos que muitos ministros da Igreja Presbiteriana (EUA) haviam rejeitado no ""Afirmação de Auburn"" de 1923. Originalmente intitulado Os Fundamentos da nossa fé, o nome foi mudado para evitar as conotações negativas que o termo Fundamentalismo tinha ganhado. Este documento serviu para assegurar que a IPE tenha mantido sempre o que é de primordial importância para todos os cristãos evangélicos(nomeadamente o Evangelho, ou boas notícias sobre Jesus), bem como para manter a ortodoxia inerente que sempre foi a marca registrada da denominação.
Nos mais de 30 anos de sua existência, a IPE tornou-se ativo como uma igreja missionária, através de plantação de igrejas nos Estados Unidos, bem como em uma variedade de campos estrangeiros, particularmente no 10/40 Janela . Um passo importante foi a incorporação do Presbitério de St. Andrews(Argentina) como um dos seus presbíteros. Este presbitério adquiriu independência nacional como o Igreja Presbiteriana de St. Andrews da Argentina depois de muitos anos de cooperação e benefício mútuo.
A partir da Assembleia Geral de 2007, a IPE criou um temporário, não geográfico, Presbitério Novo Odres, para fornecer um lar para as igrejas associadas à Associação Novo Odres de Igrejas(New Wineskins Association of Churches - NWAC) que é formada por ex-membros da Igreja Presbiteriana (EUA) buscando encontrar um novo lar denominacional depois de descobrir que a denominação em que se encontram atualmente não lhes é considerada adequada teologicamente, organizacionalmente, ou no caráter missional. O Presbitério Novo Odres foi dissolvido em 2011, como sua missão foi concluída.
Jeff Jeremias, o secretário da denominação anunciou na Assembleia Geral de 2012, realizada na Primeira Igreja Presbiteriana de Baton Rouge, Louisiana , que o número de congregações da IPE tinha aumentado de 182 em 2007 para 364 do 2012, exatamente dobrando em número.


== Essenciais ==
A igreja tem uma declaração oficial de sete pontos dos ""Essenciais da nossa fé"". Estes Essenciais são apresentados em maior detalhe na Confissão de Fé de Westminster . A IPE adoptou também uma explicação da relação entre os ""Fundamentos da nossa fé"" e os Padrões de Westminster.


== Comparação com outras denominações presbiterianas Norte-americanas ==
Como o próprio nome sugere, o IPE é uma denominação evangélica. Ele associa-se principalmente com corpos reformados que conservam crenças semelhantes ou idênticas sobre a Cristologia, Eclesiologia e posturas éticas/morais. Tal como acontece com praticamente todos os órgãos Presbiteriana ortodoxos, a IPE está empenhada em interpretação bíblica regido pela Confissão de Fé de Westminster, Catecismo Maior de Westminster e Breve Catecismo de Westminster. A IPE é membro da Comunhão Mundial das Igrejas Reformadas
Sendo totalmente dentro da corrente principal Reformada, e da ortodoxia de Westminster, a IPE é mais conservador do que a Igreja Presbiteriana (EUA)) sobre assuntos como teologia e comportamento pessoal, ainda é mais moderado do que as principais denominações presbiterianas conservadoras nos Estados Unidos - a Igreja Presbiteriana na América, a Igreja Presbiteriana Reformada Associados e a Igreja Presbiteriana Ortodoxa. A posição mediana da IPE é semelhante à ECO:Ordem Aliança de Igrejas Evangélicas Presbiterianas , que foi formada em 2012 a partir de igrejas que saem do . O Ethos da IPE (resumido em seu lema) permite um maior grau de liberdade em áreas consideradas não essenciais para a teologia reformada do que a Igreja Presbiteriana na América, Igreja Presbiteriana Reformada Associada (EUA) e Igreja Presbiteriana Ortodoxa.


=== A ordenação de mulheres e o movimento carismático ===
Um exemplo de posição mediana da IPE dentro presbiterianismo americano é a ordenação de mulheres, o que é deixada para cada igreja local decidir (por exemplo, cada sessão de igreja local determina se as mulheres podem servir como presbíteras e diaconisas, cada presbitério local determina se as mulheres podem servir como ministras. Várias igrejas da IPE tem diaconisas e anciãs, mas poucas igrejas permitem as mulheres ocupar o cargo sozinha ou de pastor sênior. Em comparação, a Igreja Presbiteriana (EUA)) e a ECO ordenam e tem mulheres ministras; a Igreja Presbiteriana Reformada Associada (EUA) permite que as mulheres sejam ordenados diaconisas, mas não como ministras ou presbíteras; Enquanto que a Igreja Presbiteriana na América não ordena formalmente as mulheres, bem como a Igreja Presbiteriana Ortodoxa Além disso, a IPE é muito mais tolerante do movimento carismático do que os grupos mais conservadores presbiterianos, e algumaa das mais proeminentes igrejas presbiterianas carismáticos da América são membros da IPE.


== Ethos ==
A IPE tem sido descrito como a versão moderna de Nova Escola do presbiterianismo , enquanto a Igreja Presbiteriana na América, Igreja Presbiteriana Reformada Associada (EUA) e IPO são, essencialmente, o equivalente moderno da Velha Escola do presbiterianismo. A maneira que isso é expresso é no lema é da denominação: ""No essencial, unidade, no não-essenciais, Liberdade; em tudo, Caridade verdade em amor."". Isso funciona como uma abordagem de três camadas para questões teológicas. Estas podem ser consideradas como problemas ""A"", ""B"" e ""C"" .
Questões de ""A"" são aqueles que têm a ver com os ""Fundamentos da nossa fé"". Este é um resumo dessas questões que são fundamentais para a fé cristã. Na IPE, não há provisão para créditos de desacordo entre os oficiais da igreja (ministros, presbíteros e diáconos) sobre estas questões. Na verdade, espera-se que todos os membros comungantes devam afirmar estes princípios da fé.
Questões de ""B"" são aqueles que são essenciais para a compreensão da fé reformada, como os chamados Cinco pontos do calvinismo, Teologia do Pacto, o governo presbiteriano, etc. A definição de questões ""B"" para a IPE é encontrado na Confissão de Fé de Westminster e no Catecismo Maior de Westminster  e Breve Catecismo de Westminster . À medida que essas questões não são tão fundamentais como os fundamentos de nossa fé, a IPE permite que ministros, presbíteros e diáconos a exceções de estado para os Padrões de Westminster, desde que essas exceções não violam o sistema de doutrina nela contido. Enquanto não se espera que os membros não-ordenados a aderirem aos Padrões de Westminster, entende-se que a posição de ensino da IPE é encontrado nos Padrões de Westminster. Finalmente, as questões ""C"" são aqueles em que Reformada, os cristãos ortodoxos podem discordar, e que não violam o sistema de doutrina da IPE. Como dito acima, o que inclui as questões da ordenação de mulheres e do movimento carismático, bem como questões como a escatologia (pontos de vista sobre o fim dos tempos), as preferências de adoração, liturgia, etc.

1533,"A expressão terapia de artes marciais se refere ao uso de artes marciais como uma terapia alternativa ou complementar de uma desordem médica, a qual pode incluir distúrbios do corpo ou da mente. Por exemploː a terapia pode promover o equilíbrio cinestésico em idosos ou deficientes através do tai chi chuan, ou reduzir a agressividade em populações específicas.


== Descrição ==
Embora tratamentos já convencionais, tais como levantamento de peso e psicoterapia, possam proporcionar benefícios significativos, as terapias das artes marciais têm características específicas que as diferenciam de outras terapias. Por exemploː para crianças com baixa autoestima, esta terapia pode, simultaneamente, aprimorar áreas como as habilidades de autodefesa (defesa contra o bullying físico), o condicionamento físico, a capacidade de administrar situações de estresse físico ou mental, e a autoconfiança. Estes resultados podem ser obtidos por meio da prática de diversas técnicas das artes marciais, tais comoː quebrar tábuas (Tameshiwari), realizar sequências de movimentos marciais (kata, kati, pumsae) ou praticar meditação.

1538,"O processo de gestão de mudança na engenharia de sistemas é o processo de requisitar, determinar o alcançável, planejar, implementar, e avaliar as mudanças para um sistema, seu objetivo principal é dar suporte ao processamento e rastreabilidade de mudanças para um conjunto de fatores interconectados.


== Introdução ==
Há uma considerável similaridade e confusão entre a gestão de mudança, a gestão de controle, e a gerência de configuração de software; a definição abaixo não integra essas áreas. Gestão de mudança foi adotada pela sua capacidade de fornecer benefícios através da melhoria do sistema afetado e assim satisfazendo as ""necessidades do cliente"", porem ainda é criticado pelo potencial em confundir e complicar de forma desnecessária a gestão de administração. Em alguns casos, perceptível principalmente na area de tecnologia da informação, mais fundos e mais trabalho são alocados na manutenção de sistemas (e na gestão de mudança) em relação para com a criação do sistema. É investido tipicamente por organizações durante a implementação inicial de grandes sistemas ERP cerca de 15% à 20% da verba total.
Seguindo o mesmo raciocínio, Hinley descreve duas das leis de Lehman sobre a evolução do software.
A lei da mudança continua: Sistemas utilizados devem mudar, ou então automaticamente se tornar menos útil.
A lei da complexidade crescente: Através de mudanças, a estrutura do sistema se torna mais complexa, e mais recursos são necessários para simplifica-las.
A gestão de mudança é também de grande importância no campo da manufatura, o qual é confrontado com muitas mudanças devido a crescente competição mundial, avanços tecnológicos e a demanda de clientes. Já que muitos sistemas tendem a mudar e evoluir conforme são usados, os problemas dessas indústrias são sentidos de alguma forma em muitas outras.


== O processo e suas entregas ==
Para a descrição do processo de gestão da mudança, a técnica de meta-modelagem é utilizada. A Figura 1 representa o diagrama de processo de dados, que é explicado nessa seção. 


=== Atividades ===
Há seis atividades principais, as quais formam em conjunto o processo de gestão de mudança. Eles são: Identificar possíveis mudanças, Avaliar mudanças, Planejar mudança, Implementar mudanças e Rever e encerrar mudanças. Essas atividades são executadas por quatro papéis diferentes, os quais são discutidos na Tabela 1. As atividades (ou suas sub-atividades, se aplicável) são descritas em si na Tabela 2.


=== Entregas ===
Além das atividades, o diagrama de processo de dados (Figura 1) mostra também as entregas de cada atividade, ou seja, seus dados. Essas entregas ou conceitos são descritos na Tabela 3; nesse contexto, os conceitos mais importantes são: REQUISIÇÃO DE MUDANÇA e o LOG DE ENTRADA DE MUDANÇA.
Que fique claro, alguns desses conceitos foram definidos pelo author (pela falta de referência), porque (boas) definições não foram encontradas, ou elas eram o resultado obvio de alguma atividade. Esses conceitos então marcados com um asterisco (‘*’). Conceitos de propriedade foram deixados de fora do modelo, já que muitos eram triviais e o diagrama poderia, de outra forma, rapidamente se tornar complexo demais. Além disso, alguns conceitos (ex: REQUISIÇÃO DE MUDANÇA, RELEASE DO SISTEMA) se dirigiam guiados pelo sistema de controle de versão como proposto por Weerd, porem isso também foi deixado de fora devido a restringir a complexidade do diagrama.
Além de somente ‘mudanças’, também é possível distinguir desvio ou renuncia. Um desvio é uma autorização (ou requisição) para poder desviar do requerimento de um item, antes da criação do mesmo. Uma renuncia é basicamente o mesmo, porem ocorrendo durante ou depois da criação de um item. Essas duas abordagens podem ser vistas como gestão de mudanças minimalísticas (isto é, sem solução real para o problema em mãos).


=== Exemplos ===

Um bom exemplo do processo de gestão da mudança em ação pode ser encontrado no desenvolvimento de software. Frequentemente os usuários reportam bugs ou o desejo de uma nova funcionalidade nos seus programas de software, o que leva a uma solicitação de alteração. A empresa de software do produto, então olha para a viabilidade técnica e econômica de implementar essa mudança e, consequentemente, decide se a mudança será realmente realizada. Se isso de fato for o caso, a mudança tem que ser planejada, por exemplo através da utilização de pontos de função. A execução real da mudança leva à criação e/ou alteração de código do software e quando esta mudança é propagada ela provavelmente faz com que outros fragmentos de código mudem também. Após os resultados dos testes iniciais parecerem satisfatórios, a documentação pode ser atualizada e liberada, em conjunto com o software. Finalmente, o gerente de projeto verifica a mudança e fecha esta entrada no log de alterações.
Outra área típica de gerenciamento de mudanças na forma como ele é tratado aqui é o domínio de fabricação. Tomemos por exemplo a concepção e produção de um carro. Se, por exemplo, os air bags do veículo são feitos para se encherem automaticamente depois de dirigir longas distâncias, isso vai sem dúvidas levar a reclamações dos clientes (ou pelo menos a relatórios de problemas durante a fase de testes). Por sua vez, estas produzem uma solicitação de alteração (ver figura 2 à direita), o que provavelmente irá justificar uma mudança. No entanto, a - muito provavelmente simplista - análise de custo e benefício tem de ser feito, após a qual o pedido de alteração pode ser aprovado. Seguindo uma análise do impacto sobre a concepção do automóvel e a agenda de produção, o planejamento para a implementação da mudança pode ser criado. De acordo com esse planejamento, a mudança pode realmente ser realizada, após a qual a nova versão do carro deveria ser exaustivamente testada antes de ser liberada para o público.


== Em plantas industriais ==
Uma vez que os processos complexos podem ser muito sensíveis até mesmo a pequenas alterações, uma boa gestão da mudança para instalações industriais e processos é reconhecida como crítica para a segurança. Nos Estados Unidos, a OSHA tem normas que regem como as mudanças devem ser feitas e documentadas. O principal requisito é que uma revisão completa de uma alteração proposta deve ser realizada por uma equipe multidisciplinar para garantir que o maior número de pontos de vista possíveis são utilizados para minimizar as chances de não identificar uma ameaça. Nesse contexto, a gestão da mudança é conhecida como Gestão da Mudança, ou GDM. É apenas um dos muitos componentes da Gestão de Segurança de Processo, seção 1910.119(l).1

Ele tinha a sua residência em Poitiers. Recusando-se a reconhecer a suberânia de Carlos Martel, ele deve enfrentar em presença, o que o leva a Bordéus e o captura logo depois.
Em seguida submete-se aos Carolíngios. Quando o seu irmão Hunaldo se submete, finalmente, ele arranca os olhos, antes de retirar-se para um mosteiro da ilha de Ré.
O seu filho Odão dito d'Oisy está na origem da primeira Casa de Oisy e foi nomeado em 780 castelão de Cambrai e senhor de Oisy por aquele que seria Carlos Magno, em compensação pela perda de sua propriedade, na Aquitânia. Este Odão desposará Elissende dita de Walincourt e Crèvecœur, e o casal é o tronco de muitas famílias nobres da Região.

1542,"The Daily Telegraph (conhecido simplesmente como The Telegraph) é um jornal britânico standard publicado em Londres pelo Telegraph Media Group e distribuído em todo o Reino Unido e internacionalmente. Foi fundado por Arthur B. Sleigh em 1855 como The Daily Telegraph and Courier. Desde 2004, ele tem sido propriedade de David e Frederick Barclay. O jornal teve uma circulação de 523.048 em março de 2014, abaixo dos 1,4 milhão em 1980.
Ele tem um jornal irmão, o The Sunday Telegraph, iniciado em 1961 e que teve circulação de 418.670 exemplares em março de 2014. Os dois jornais são administrados separadamente, com diferentes equipes editoriais. Artigos publicados em qualquer um deles podem ser publicados no site www.telegraph.co.uk do Telegraph Media Group, sob o título de The Telegraph.
O jornal é amplamente considerado como um dos principais ""jornais de referência"" do país e tem sido descrito pela BBC como sendo ""jornal do establishment"".
Entre os furos mais notáveis estão o escândalo das despesas de parlamentares britânicos que levou a uma série de demissões políticas e sua investigação secreta sobre o gerente de futebol da Inglaterra, Sam Allardyce.


== História editorial ==
O Telegraph é tradicionalmente visto como um jornal de direita no aspecto político. A combinação das ligações pessoais entre a equipe editorial do jornal e as lideranças do Partido Conservador, juntamente com a influência do jornal sobre os ativistas conservadoras, resultaram com que o jornal seja frequentemente referido jocosamente como The Torygraph.

1543,"A Bundesanstalt Technisches Hilfswerk (Agência Federal do Socorro Técnico, THW) é uma organização de ações de assistência em situações de catástrofe controlada pelo governo federal alemão. Cerca de 99 % dos seus membros são voluntários.


== Tarefas ==
As tarefas do THW são descritas em uma lei chamada Helferrechtsgesetz. Essas tarefas são:
Socorro técnico na Alemanha como parte da defesa civil
Socorro técnico ou humanitário em países estrangeiros, com nomeação pelo governo
Socorro técnico e logístico de outro (alemão) GOs, ONG ou outras autoridades como brigadas de fogo, polícia ou as autoridades alfandegárias.


== História ==

Depois da Segunda Guerra Mundial, o Technisches Hilfswerk foi fundado em 1950.
O objetivo principal foi a defesa civil no caso da guerra. Isto modificou-se durante as décadas; hoje o THW é um ajudante capaz em um largo espectro de desastres, como acidentes de tráfego, desastres industriais, ou terremotos.
A maior ação de controle de desastre realizou-se em Agosto de 2002, depois da inundação severa do rio de Elbe na Alemanha oriental.
Ao todo, aproximadamente 24.000 membros THW participaram na operação, com até 10.000 pessoas que ajudam simultaneamente ao longo do Elbe e os seus tributários.

A maior ação fora da Alemanha esteve em França em 2000, quando as tempestades destruíram o sistema elétrico, e a maior parte das árvores que bloquearam muitas ruas. O trabalho principal fornecia o poder elétrico temporário dos hospitais e outras instituições importantes e reedificava partes do sistema elétrico.
A organização também foi ativa em muitas operações de ações de assistência em situações de catástrofe fora, por exemplo o tsunami de 2004, o Furacão Katrina em 2005, e o terremoto de Cachmir, também em 2005.


== Organização ==
O THW é colocado por todas as partes da Alemanha em 669 bases locais, chamadas Ortsverbände. Aproximadamente 80.000 pessoas trabalham para esta organização.

A maioria daqueles é voluntários, enquanto aproximadamente 800 são de tempo integral de trabalho na administração da organização. Cada Ortsverbände mantém um ou vários Technische Züge (pelotões técnicos), cada um composto de um Zugtrupp (ordene a equipe), compreendendo quatro voluntários, dois Bergungsgruppen, compreensão de nove para doze voluntários, e uns para três Fachgruppen, compreensão de quatro para dezoito voluntários.


== Bergungsgruppe ==
O tipo principal da unidade THW (aproximadamente dois fora de três) é o Bergungsgruppe (resgate e esquadra de salvamento), equipado com instrumentos pesados como tesoura hidráulica, cadeia saws, e martelos pneumáticos.


== Fachgruppen ==

Os Fachgruppen (esquadras) incluem:
Infrastruktur (infraestrutura),
Räumen (despejo de entulho),
Elektroversorgung (provisão elétrica),
Beleuchtung (iluminação),
Wasserschaden / Pumpen (o dano de água / bombeando),
Wassergefahren (o risco de água),
Logistik (logística),
Ö lschaden (poluição de óleo),
Trinkwasserversorgung (distribuição de água e tratamento),
Führung und Kommunikation (ordem de unidade técnica, controle e comunicações)
Ortung (detenção)
entre outros.


== Operações estrangeiras ==
Para o socorro em países estrangeiros, há quatro unidades Schnelleinsatzeinheiten Bergung Ausland (ou SEEBA, pesquisa de unidade de desdobramento rápida e resgate), capazes de ir transportados pelo ar dentro de seis horas, e cinco unidades Schnelleinsatzeinheiten Wasserversorgung Ausland ou SEEWA (distribuição de água de desdobramento rápida e tratamento).


== Alistamento ==
Na Alemanha, o serviço militar era obrigatório para homens adultos.
Em vez de se juntar ao serviço militar por nove meses, uma das alternativas era de se juntar a uma organização de voluntário de não-combatentes do Katastrophenschutz alemão (ações de assistência em situações de catástrofe) ou Zivilschutz (defesa civil) para um mínimo de seis anos.",pt,Technisches Hilfswerk,https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technisches_Hilfswerk

Savage foi selecionado pelo Texans na quarta rodada (135º no geral) do Draft de 2014. Em sua carreira constam jogos de futebol americano universitário pelo Rutgers, Arizona e Pittsburgh.


== Carreira profissional ==
No Draft de 2014, Savage foi selecionado na quarta rodada (135º no geral) pelo Houston Texans. Em 15 de Maio de 2014, ele assinou um contrato de quatro anos com a equipe. No dia 14 de dezembro, ele fez sua estreia de temporada regular depois que Ryan Fitzpatrick quebrou a perna contra o Indianapolis Colts.
Em 5 de setembro de 2015, Savage foi lesionado e colocado na reserva dos Texans.
Em 2016, Savage entrou no jogo da Semana 15 contra o Jacksonville Jaguars no lugar de Brock Osweiler. Savage entrou em campo quando o time perdia por 13-0 e completou 23 de 36 passes para 260 jardas, conduzindo o Texans para uma vitória de virada por 21-20.
Savage foi nomeado o quarterback titular para a Semana 16, em um jogo contra o Cincinnati Bengals. Ele completou 18 de 29 passes para 176 jardas e a vitória por 12-10 contra o Bengals, garantindo o título AFC Sul para os Texans. Na Semana 17, Savage deixou o jogo no segundo quarto com uma aparente concussão, mas depois voltou para o jogo. Durante o intervalo, ele foi re-avaliado com uma concussão e excluído para o resto do jogo. Devido à lesão de Savage, Osweiler foi escolhido para começar o jogo de Wild card dos playoffs contra o Oakland Raiders.

Marcel entrou no seminário e concluiu os seus estudos teológicos no Seminário Francês, em Roma, sob a orientação do pensador Padre Le Floch. Ordenado presbítero em 1929, entrou na Congregação do Espírito Santo. Em 1932 partiu em missão para África Gabão. Retorna a França onde permanece por 2 anos e vai para Dacar, em 1947. Nesse ano, é consagrado bispo pelo cardeal Liénart. Foi nomeado por Pio XII Vigário Apostólico e, mais tarde, Delegado Apostólico para toda a África francófona (com o título de Arcebispo de Arcadiópolis)  e posteriormente Arcebispo de Dacar, onde esteve até 1962. A pedido do Papa, colaborou na elaboração de diretrizes missionárias para a evangelização da África, trabalho que resultou nos missionários ""Fidei Donum"" e na conversão de grande número de africanos ao Catolicismo. Dom Lefebvre opunha-se, então, à constituição em África duma hierarquia episcopal indígena, que tornaria a Igreja africana autónoma da missionação européia, por acreditar que o momento ainda não era maduro doutrinariamente para a transição. Por causa das suas posições, o presidente do Senegal, Senghor, solicitou a Roma que o retirasse, no que foi atendido pelo Papa João XXIII. Foi substituído na Arquidiocese de Dakar pelo seu filho espiritual, o futuro Cardeal Hyacinthe TiandoumSaiu do Senegal tendo ganho o respeito da maioria dos senegaleses, incluindo dos muçulmanos e dos animistas.
Regressado a França, foi nomeado bispo da menor diocese francesa, a de Tulle, no centro do país. Permaneceu lá apenas seis meses, pois em julho de 1962 foi eleito superior-geral da Congregação do Espírito Santo.
Mais tarde, após o apelo de um grupo de seminaristas, renunciou ao cargo de superior da Congregação do Espírito Santo, fundando, assim, a Fraternidade Sacerdotal São Pio X.


== Brasão ==
Descrição: Escudo eclesiástico, partido: 1º de jalde com um leão rampante de sable armado e lampassado de goles; o 2º de jalde com uma cruz de goles carregada de uma estrela de cinco pontas, de argente , posta na interseção, e acantonada por quatro moletas de cinco pontas, de blau. O escudo assente em tarja branca, na qual se encaixa o pálio branco com cruzetas de sable. O conjunto pousado sobre uma cruz trevolada de de dois traços, de ouro. O todo encimado pelo chapéu eclesiástico com seus cordões em cada flanco, terminados por dez borlas cada um,postas: 1,2,3 e 4, tudo de verde, forrado de vermelho. Brocante sobre a ponta da cruz um listel de Argente com o lema ET NOS CREDIDIMVS CARITATI , em letras de sable.
Interpretação: O escudo obedece às regras heráldicas para os eclesiásticos. O 1º e o 2º campos de jalde (ouro) traduzem nobreza, autoridade, premência, generosidade, ardor e descortínio. O leão, sendo o “Rei dos Animais”, representa fortaleza, bravura e nobreza e seu esmalte sable (negro) simboliza: a sabedoria, a ciência, a honestidade e a firmeza. A cruz, combinação da pala com a faixa, é peça honrosa de primeira ordem e recorda as cruzadas e mais particularmente o Santíssimo Salvador, sendo de goles (vermelho) representa o fogo da caridade inflamada, bem como valor e socorro aos necessitados. A Estrela lembra a Virgem Maria, “Estrela da Manhã” e ”Aurora da Salvação” e, pelo seu metal argente (prata) traduz inocência, castidade, a pureza e eloquência. As moletas simbolizam as esporas do cavaleiros cruzados, sendo de blau (azul), traduzem justiça, serenidade, fortaleza, boa fama e nobreza. O lema: “E nós cremos na caridade” foi tirado da Primeira carta de São João (1 Jo 4,16): “E nós conhecemos, e cremos na caridade que Deus nos tem”.


== D. Lefebvre no Concílio Vaticano II ==
D. Lefebvre integrou a comissão preparatória do Concílio Vaticano II . Terminado o Concílio, embora tivesse firmado todos os seus documentos, afligiam-no algumas questões entre as quais a liberdade religiosa e o ecumenismo, assim como a colegialidade dos Bispos (que lhe parecia diminuir o poder do Papa). Tudo isto pareceu a Dom Lefebvre uma guinada da Igreja em direcção ao modernismo e ao liberalismo, condenados por Papas anteriores. Convencido de que o Concílio conduzira os fiéis ao erro, o arcebispo colocou-se contra o que considerava a “protestantização da Igreja”. Nos anos seguintes, em repetidos artigos e homilias, falou contra as novidades trazidas pelo Concílio que, na sua opinião, punham em xeque a Tradição da Igreja e eram resultado de uma infiltração maçônica, notadamente pela Missa Nova.


== A fundação da Fraternidade Sacerdotal de S. Pio X ==
Em 1970, D. Lefebvre decide fundar uma casa destinada à formação de sacerdotes no espírito pré-conciliar. Com autorização do bispo de Friburgo, na Suíça, nasce o seminário de Écône e a Fraternidade Sacerdotal de S. Pio X (FSSPX), erecta canonicamente a 1 de novembro de 1970 pelo bispo da Diocese de Losana-Genebra-Friburgo.


== Dom Lefebvre e a FSSPX de 1970 a 1988 ==

Dom Lefebvre cria vários priorados na França, no Canadá e nos Estados Unidos com a finalidade de agrupar os sacerdotes e fiéis católicos que queriam praticar o catolicismo segundo a Doutrina e Sacramentos em sua forma anterior a reforma conciliar, além de ordenar novos sacerdotes e suscitar vocações. Em maio de 1976, viaja novamente aos Estados Unidos e mantém contato com comunidades de católicos de Nova York, Saint-Paul e Minneapolis, além de visitar especialmente a Fraternidade de São Pio X, em Armada, no Estado do Michigan. O Papa Paulo VI proibiu Dom Lefebvre ordenar sacerdotes, devido ao não ensinamento do espírito conciliar em seus seminários, mas essa proibição, para Mons. Lefebvre, não teve justificativa doutrinal e com vista à salvação das almas na chamada crise pós-conciliar. Isso fez ocorrer em 29 de junho de 1976, em Écône, a sagração de sacerdotes feitas pelo Arcebispo, ordenando jovens seminaristas oriundos da França, Bélgica e Estados Unidos, numa cerimonia em que reafirma os motivos pelos quais devia agir e faz várias críticas ao modernismo na Igreja, ao Concílio Vaticano II e conseqüente e abrupta crise vocacional (sacerdotes e religiosos) na Igreja e à ao abandono do sacerdócio e da vida religiosa por parte de muitos. Ele diz, com base na Bula de São Pio V que todos os sacerdotes tem o direito de rezar a Missa conforme o Missal codificado por São Pio V sem peso de consciência e que tais sanções seriam nulas graças ao Estado de Necessidade visto no antigo e novo Código de Direito Canônico. Em 24 de julho de 1976, o Vaticano aplica uma suspensão a divinis a Monsenhor Marcel Lefebvre, e uma suspensão aos 26 sacerdotes da FSSPX ilicitamente ordenados. Conseqüentemente, a partir daquele momento, levando-se em conta que as sanções foram válidas, Dom Lefebvre não poderia mais celebrar Missa, pregar, nem ministrar sacramentos. Em 1984, João Paulo II concede um Indulto (autorização excepcional) para se celebrar a Missa Tridentina em casos específicos. Bento XVI abrange essa permissão com seu Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum.


== A tentativa de acordo entre Roma e a FSSPX ==
Roma pretende um acordo que regularize a situação da FSSPX. Após várias conversações, é firmado um acordo, em 5 de maio de 1988, assinado por Lefebvre e pelo cardeal Joseph Ratzinger.
Este acordo previa a regularização canónica da FSSPX, pela sua transformação em Sociedade de Vida Apostólica, e recebeu um mandato apostólico para a ordenação dum bispo entre os padres da Fraternidade.
Mons. Lefebvre, porém, removeu sua assinatura do acordo graças a adiação constante da data da sagração do bispo. Estava já com idade avançada e com saúde defasada, tinha câncer. Alegou que os bispos encarregados em decidir a data da sagração estavam fazendo o máximo possível para impossibilitá-la e que perdeu a confiança nas atuais autoridades romanas, não podendo esperar mais.
Carta de Dom Lefebvre ao Santo Padre João Paulo II:

No início da cerimônia de sagração espiscopal, pede-se ao Bispo que consagra que apresente o mandato ou delegação da Santa Sé:
-- Tendes um mandato apostólico?
-- Temos.
-- Leiam-no.


== As ordenações episcopais de 1988 e a reação de Roma ==

Lefebvre decide ordenar novos bispos para a Fraternidade, e anuncia a realização da cerimónia para 30 de junho de 1988, em Écône. O Papa João Paulo II pede-lhe expressamente que o não faça, mas Lefebvre sagra quatro bispos de entre os padres da Fraternidade - não lhes conferindo, porém, qualquer jurisdição. Consagrou os novos bispos juntamente com D. António de Castro Mayer, bispo emérito de Campos (Brasil), que nessa diocese reunia cerca de 25 sacerdotes (União Sacerdotal São João Maria Vianney) que continuavam a celebrar o rito romano tradicional.Foram eles o suíço Bernard Fellay (atual superior da FSSPX), o francês Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, o espanhol Alfonso de Galarreta e o inglês Richard Williamson. Tal acto acarretaria, canonicamente, a excomunhão latae sententiae (automática), por constituir um acto em si mesmo desobediente. Lefebvre invocou o estado de necessidade, segundo o qual todas as penas de excomunhão latae sententiae seriam nulas. Dois dias depois, João Paulo II publica o motu proprio “Ecclesia Dei”, que manifesta a ""grande aflição da Igreja católica por causa das ordenações episcopais ilegais"", declara a excomunhão de Lefebvre e dos bispos por ele ordenados e convida os seus seguidores a afastarem-se da Fraternidade.
A excomunhão dos quatro bispos por ele ordenados, Bernard Fellay (atual superior da FSSPX), o francês Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, o espanhol Alfonso de Galarreta e o inglês Richard Williamson, foi revogada próprio Vaticano, em 24 de janeiro de 2009, pelo Papa Bento XVI, no seu desejo de encontrar uma plena reconciliação com a Fraternidade Sacerdotal São Pio X.


== A morte de Marcel Lefebvre ==
D. Marcel Lefebvre morre, aos 85 anos, em Martigny, a 25 de março de 1991.
A Editora Permanência publicou no Brasil o documentário ""Um bispo na tormenta"", retratando a vida de Dom Marcel Lefebvre. O documentário abrange toda a vida do bispo de Ecône, desde sua infância, passando por seus anos de seminário, seu trabalho como missionário da África, as responsabilidades que assumiu como Arcebispo de Dakar e Protonotário Apostólico para toda a África de língua francesa, sua eleição como Superior Geral da Congregação dos Padres do Espírito Santo, seu papel durante o Concílio Vaticano II, a posterior fundação da Fraternidade Sacerdotal São Pio X, o crescimento dessa ordem sacerdotal e, finalmente, a história da polêmica Sagração episcopal de 1988, as excomunhões e seus últimos anos de vida.

1554,"José Pinto do Carmo Cintra (Amparo, 30 de abril de 1850 — São Paulo, 17 de outubro de 1929) foi um advogado, empresário, proprietário rural e banqueiro brasileiro.


== Empresário ==
Filho do terceiro Barão de Campinas, Carmo Cintra herdou grandes porções de terras nos municípios paulistas de Amparo e Serra Negra, dedicando-se à cafeicultura.
Sob a liderança da empresa 'Carmo Cintra e Irmão, foi responsável por diversos empreendimentos, como a Fábrica de Gás e Óleos Minerais de Taubaté. Fundou o Banco Construtor e Agrícola do Estado de São Paulo e, em sua terra natal, construiu, em 1890, o Teatro João Caetano, sob encomenda ao engenheiro Garcia Redondo e decoração por Benedito Calixto.


== Republicano ==
A despeito de suas origens nobiliárquicas, Carmo Cintra fora republicano histórico. Participou, na residência de Bernardino José de Campos Júnior, em Amparo, das primeiras reuniões republicanas desta cidade, bem como representou o burgo amparense na Convenção de Itu, em 1873, importante evento da história republicana brasileira. Sobre sua vida republicana, o jornalista Luís Martins escreveu a obra O Patriarca e o Bacharel, em que narra, sob o pano de fundo da vida de Carmo Cintra, o movimento republicano em um viés parricida e decepcionante diante das mazelas enfrentadas no início do novo regime no Brasil.
Em sua homenagem, o governo paulista denominou uma via pública em seu nome, a rua Carmo Cintra, no bairro do Bom Retiro, na região central da cidade.

1561,"Muzaim ibne Cagã (em árabe: مزاحم بن خاقان‎; transl.: Muzahim ibn Khaqan , lit. Muzaim, filho de Cagã; m. 868) foi um comandante militar turco à serviço do Califado Abássida no século IX. Filho e irmão de oficiais influentes, começou sua carreira participando na campanha de Uacife, o Turco contra o Império Bizantino em 862, e então reprimiu uma revolta tribal na Jordânia no mesmo ano.
Em 865, com a eclosão da guerra civil entre os califas Almostaim (r. 862–866) e Almutaz (r. 866–869), participou inicialmente ao lado do primeiro, vindo a realizar campanha contra os rebeldes alidas em Cufa, no Iraque, mas acabou sendo convencido a mudar de posição após receber uma carta de Almutaz. Em 866, alegadamente foi enviado para Melitene, na fronteira bizantina, onde participou duma campanha contra os bizantinos.
Em 866, seria enviado como chefe dum exército ao Egito para ajudar o governador Iázide a combater a eclosão de vários focos rebeldes na província, o que consegue com parcial sucesso. Iázide é demitido no ano seguinte por não conseguir lidar com os problemas provinciais, e Muzaim é nomeado governador, posto que manteria até 868, quando falece.


== Vida ==


=== Começo da carreira ===

Muzaim foi o filho de Cagã Urtuje e irmão de Alfaite, que foram figuras influentes durante os califados de Almotácime (r. 833–842) e Mutavaquil (r. 847–861) respectivamente. Ele aparece pela primeira vez em 862, durante o reinado de Almontacir (r. 861–862), quando foi nomeado comandante da campanha de Uacife, o Turco contra os bizantinos. Sob o sucessor de Almontacir, Almostaim (r. 862–866), ele liderou um exército turco para suprimir uma revolta tribal na Jordânia após as autoridades locais provarem-se incapazes de derrotar os rebeldes.
Após a eclosão da guerra civil em 865 entre os califas rivais Almostaim (em Bagdá) e Almutaz (em Samarra), Muzaim inicialmente apoio o primeiro e fez seu caminho de Raca para Bagdá, onde foi recebido com honra. Pelos próximos vários meses, participou na defesa de Bagdá e foi ferido quando atingido por uma flecha.
No verão de 865, com a guerra civil ainda em curso, Almostaim enviou Muzaim para assegurar Cufa, que havia caído para rebeldes alidas. Muzaim derrotou-os e forçou os alidas a fugir; também ordenou a suas tropas que ateassem fogo em Cufa após encontrar resistência dentro da cidade.[a] Após reportar as notícias da conquista, Muzaim recebeu uma carta de Almutaz, instando-o a desertar Almostaim. Após discutir a proposta, Muzaim e alguns de seus soldados concordaram em mudar sua posição, e fizeram seu caminho para Samarra.
Após o fim da guerra civil em 866, que resultou na coroação de Almutaz como califa único (r. 866–869), Muzaim foi enviado para Melitene, na fronteira bizantina, e relatadamente partiu em campanha contra os bizantinos.


=== Governo do Egito ===

Em agosto de 866, Muzaim chegou ao Egito com um exército para reforçar o governador da província Iázide, que estava tendo dificuldades para lidar com algumas revoltas, incluindo aquela de Jabir ibne Alualide. Após a chegada de Muzaim, Iázide e seus tenentes foram subsequentemente capazes de fazer progresso contra os rebeldes, mas foram incapazes de derrotá-los completamente, e em 867 Almutaz demitiu Iázide como governador e nomeou Muzaim em seu lugar.
Após a recepção de sua nomeação, Muzaim continuou com seu esforço para pacificar a província. Após debelar uma revolta de Haufe do Baixo Egito, Muzaim e seu chefe de segurança (churta) Azjur, o Turco mudaram sua atenção para derrotar Jabir. Os meses subsequentes foram gastos em campanha contra o rebelde, e o último finalmente ansiou pela paz em agosto de 867; Muzaim, contudo, prendeu-o em Fostate e no ano seguinte Jabir foi enviado ao Iraque.
Segundo o historiador egípcio Alcindi, durante a administração de Muzaim seu tenente Azjur introduziu algumas práticas rituais que eram anteriormente estrangeiras ao Egito. Mulheres foram banidas de banhos e cemitérios, enquanto atores e rezadeiras foram presos e lamentações em funerais foram proscritos. A chamada para a oração seria realizada apenas pela parte traseira da mesquita; adoradores na mesquita deveriam situar-se em filas ordenadas e não eram permitidos levar almofadas. A recitação da basmala na mesquita durante orações foram proibidas, e durante o mês do Ramadã apenas cinco orações foram permitidas, em vez do costume egípcio de seis.
Muzaim morreu em 868, após contrair uma doença. Após sua morte, seu filho e sucessor designado Amade tomou o governo do Egito, porém viria exercer a função por poucos meses naquele ano, já que morreria de causas não relatadas.

1568,"Os jebuseus (em hebraico: יְבוּסִי, moderno Yvusiy, tiberiano Yəḇûsî; árabe: يبسين) foram, de acordo com a Bíblia hebraica, uma tribo cananeia que viviam em Jerusalém (cidade que haviam fundado) antes da sua ocupação pelo rei Davi, narrada no livro de II Samuel 5:6-9; o Livro dos Reis afirma que Jerusalém era conhecida como Jebus antes da ocasião. De acordo com certas cronologias bíblicas, a cidade foi reconquistada por Davi em 1003 a.C., enquanto outras fontes dão a data como 869 a.C..
Devido à vantagem militar que possuíam e à segurança garantida pelas muralhas da cidade, também conhecida por fortaleza de Sião, os jebuseus não foram expulsos durante a conquista de Canaã pelos israelitas, tornando-se então um território neutro na fronteira entre as tribos de Benjamim e de Judá.


== Origem étnica ==
A parte da Bíblia conhecida pelos judeus como Tanakh contém o único texto da Antiguidade ainda existente que utilizou o termo jebuseu para descrever os habitantes pré-israelitas de Jerusalém; de acordo com a Tábua das Nações (Gênesis, 10), os jebuseus são identificados como uma tribo cananeia, listada em terceiro lugar entre os grupos cananeus, entre os hititas bíblicos e os amoritas. Antes dos estudos arqueológicos modernos, a maior parte dos estudiosos da Bíblia sustentava a opinião de que os jebuseus seriam os hititas; o ponto de vista continua a ser sustentado por parte da academia, embora seja menos predominante. Um ponto de vista cada vez mais popular, no entanto, proposto pela primeira vez por Edward Lipinski, professor de Estudos Orientais e Eslavônicos na Universidade Católica de Leuven, alega que os jebuseus seriam provavelmente uma tribo amorita; Lipinski identificou-os com o grupo chamado de Yabusi'um numa carta escrita em letras cuneiformes descoberta nos arquivos de Mari, na Síria. O próprio Lipinski nota, entretanto, que é inteiramente possível que dois ou mais clãs ou tribos possam ter partilhado nomes semelhantes, e que os jebuseus e os yabusi'um possam ter sido povos diferentes com nomes parecidos. Nas cartas de Amarna é feita menção a um rei contemporâneo de Jerusalém chamado Abdi-Heba - um nome teofórico, que invoca uma deusa hurrita chamada Hebat; a menos que um grupo étnico diferente tenha ocupado Jerusalém neste período, isto implica que os próprias jebuseus seriam hurrianos, ou fortemente influenciados pela cultura hurrita, ou ainda dominados pela classe hurrita dos maryannu.


== Jebuseus mencionados na Bíblia ==


=== Melquisedeque ===
De acordo com o Gênesis, o soberano de Jerusalém na época de Abraão era Melquisedeque, também um sacerdote. Posteriormente, Josué aparece descrito como derrotando um rei jebusita chamado Adonisedeque. As primeiras partes de seus nomes significam ""rei"" (Melekh) e ""Senhor"" (Adon), respectivamente, e a segunda parte, zedek, pode ser traduzida como ""justo"" (possibilitando o significado dos nomes de ""meu rei é justo"" e ""meu senhor é justo""); porém grande parte dos estudiosos bíblicos acredita que o termo se refira a uma divindade chamada Zedek, a principal divindade venerada pelos jebuseus (permitindo uma tradução de ""meu rei é Zedek"" e ""meu senhor é Zedek"").
Existe alguma incerteza entre os estudiosos, no entanto, se o próprio Melquisedeque fora referido como jebusita, ou apenas como membro de outro grupo que dominou Jerusalém antes dos jebuseus - já que a cidade é mencionada como Salem, e não como Jebus, nas passagens bíblicas que o mencionam.

1571,"Thomas Mun (1571–1641) foi um escritor inglês de economia que tem sido chamado o último dos primeiros mercantilistas. Ele foi um dos primeiros a reconhecer a exportação de serviços, ou itens invisíveis, como comércio valioso, tendo feito argumentações precursoras em forte apoio ao capitalismo.
Mun começou a sua carreira pela prática de comércio no Mediterrâneo e depois estabeleceu-se em Londres, acumulando uma grande fortuna. Foi membro do Comité da Companhia das Índias Orientais e da comissão permanente do comércio, para a qual foi nomeado em 1622. A permanência de Mun como diretor da companhia das Índias Orientais coincidiu com uma escassez de prata na Inglaterra, e ele foi chamado a defender a prática de exportação de grandes quantidades de prata.
O trabalho do Mun de 1621, A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East Indies' (""Um discurso de comércio da Inglaterra até as Índias Orientais""), é em grande parte uma defesa das práticas da companhia. No entanto, é pelo seu trabalho England's Treasure by Foreign Trade (""Tesouro da Inglaterra pelo comércio externo"") que ele é mais conhecido. Embora possivelmente tenha sido escrito cerca de 1630, não foi dado a conhecer ao público até 1664, quando foi ""publicado para o bem comum, pelo seu filho John"" e dedicado a Thomas, Conde de Southampton. Enquanto Mun é muitas vezes comparado favoravelmente com Josiah Child, outro mercantilista clássico, o Tesouro da Inglaterra foi considerado um repúdio direto aos argumentos de Gerard de Malynes. Nele encontramos pela primeira vez uma declaração clara da teoria da balança comercial.
De acordo com Mun, comércio era a única maneira de aumentar o tesouro de Inglaterra e nesse sentido propôs vários cursos de ação: consumo frugal para aumentar a quantidade de bens disponíveis para exportação, maior utilização da terra e outros recursos naturais internos, para reduzir requisitos de importação, redução de direitos de exportação sobre bens produzidos internamente usando materiais estrangeiros e a exportação de mercadorias com demanda inelástica que poderia gerar mais dinheiro através de preços mais altos.",pt,Thomas Mun,https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mun

Para além de ser vendida em preparação simples de droga única, está também disponível como combinação contendo melitraceno e flupentixol.
A farmacologia do melitraceno ainda não foi investigada de maneira apropriada e é largamente desconhecida, mas pensa-se de atue de maneira similar ao outros antidepressivos tricíclicos. De fato, há relatos de que o melitraceno tem efeitos e eficácia semelhantes à imipramina e à amitriptilina, mas com tolerância melhorada e um menor intervalo de tempo até ser observada a sua ação.

1580,"Jean Ronny Johnsen (Sandefjord, 10 de junho de 1969) é um ex-futebolista norueguês.


== Carreira ==


=== Início e sucesso no Manchster United ===
Johnsen, que durante sua carreira jogava tanto como zagueiro quanto como meio-campista, jogou nas categorias de base de três times sem expressão de seu país: Sem, Stokke e Eik-Tønsberg. A carreira profissional começou somente em 1992, no Lyn. Após passagens por Lillestrøm e Beşiktaş entre 1994 e 1996, o poderoso Manchester United contratou Johnsen neste último ano. Foram seis anos nos Red Devils, tendo como ponto culminante o título do Copa Europeia/Sul-Americana de 1999 sobre o Palmeiras, até que o Aston Villa contratou o norueguês ao fim do contrato com o United.


=== Declínio ===
Nos Villains, Johnsen continuaria sendo um dos líderes da defesa do time de Birmingham até o fim da temporada 2003/04. Antes do início da temporada seguinte, o Newcastle contratou Johnsen para ser novamente o líder da defesa dos Magpies, mas sua terceira aventura na velha Albion foi um retumbante fracasso: apenas três jogos e a amargura de um contrato rompido antes do ano de 2004 se encerrar.


=== Volta à Noruega ===
Decepcionado por ter sido despedido pelo Newcastle, Johnsen, agora com 35 anos, chegou a anunciar o encerramento da carreira, mas voltou atrás e decidiu voltar ao seu país, para defender o Vålerenga, assinando contrato de um ano. Seus desempenhos o levaram a prorrogar o mesmo por mais dois anos. Durante sua passagem, Johnsen foi o comandante da defesa do time azul de Oslo, tendo atuado em 59 oportunidades, e marcado seis gols.


=== A despedida ===
Faltando 14 partidas para atingir a marca de 300, Johnsen encerrou oficialmente a carreira de jogador após a partida contra o Brann, derrotado pelo Vålerenga por 1 a 0.


== Carreira internacional ==
Johnsen estreou na Seleção Norueguesa de Futebol em 1991, mas não conseguiu convencer o treinador Egil Olsen a levá-lo para a Copa de 1994 - em vez dele, Olsen levou um homônimo: Erland Johnsen.
Após ter disputado a Copa de 1998, Johnsen, que fracassou em levar a Noruega para o Copa de 2002 - ele não foi convocado para a Euro 2000 -, jogaria com a camisa vermelha até 2007, quando disse adeus à carreira internacional, já aos 38 anos.

1590,"O crioulo indo-português de Bengala era um crioulo indo-português falado em várias cidades de Bengala, na Índia e Bangladesh: (Calcutá, Balasore, Pipli, Chandernagore, Chittagong, Midnapore, Hugli, Daca…). Esta língua foi formada a partir do contato entre a língua portuguesa e várias línguas locais. Na atualidade este crioulo encontra-se totalmente extinto.


== História ==
A língua portuguesa foi, nos séculos XVII e XVIII, a ""língua franca"" em Bengala. Em 1811, o português era usado em todas as igrejas cristãs (católicas e protestantes) de Calcutá. No início do século XX, apenas umas poucas famílias falavam uma forma corrompida de português misturadas com muitas palavras da língua inglesa.
Atualmente, nas cidades bengalesas, a reivindicação da ""portugalidade"" ou da ""cristianidade"" (frequentemente ligadas) serve de modo evidente na manutenção da coesão das pequenas cidades com antiga ascendência política portuguesa – provavelmente cidades fundadas por descendentes de mercenários asiáticos a serviço de portugueses nos séculos XVI e XVII. Esses bengalis, porém, não se distinguiam em nada de outros indianos pela língua ou pelos ritos religiosos (os cristãos são numerosos em Bengala).

1598,"O Colectivo Ultras 95 é uma claque que apoia o Futebol Clube do Porto. O Colectivo Ultras 95 foi criado em 1995, tal como o nome indica, e na altura era conhecido como o ""Colectivo Curva Norte"" por estar situado na antiga bancada superior-norte do histórico Estádio das Antas. A sua criação partiu de um grupo de amigos que fazia parte da outra grande claque do Futebol Clube do Porto, os Super Dragões, que não estava satisfeita com algumas questões de ordem de gestão e ambiente nessa mesma claque. Assim sendo, juntaram-se em dias de jogo na superior oposta àquela em que os Super Dragões se posicionavam sempre e começaram o CCN.
Com o passar dos tempos, o Colectivo foi adquirindo cada vez maior protagonismo e desde a sua criação tem visto o seu número de associados crescer.


== História ==
Na temporada de 94/95, três elementos decidiram criar um novo projecto atravé sde um Grupo ultra, fisicamente localizado na antiga superior Norte do Estádio das Antas. Estes elementos tinham abandonado os SD devido às dificuldades de organização e começaram a pensar em criar um grupo que tivesse como mote, uma nova mentalidade, e nasce o nome de ""Colectivo"", cujo funcionamento assenta no seu topónimo. Inicialmente, acrescentamos a designação de ""Curva Norte"", pela nossa loocalização no Estádio.
A 6 de Julho de 1995, data oficial da fundação, estava já estabelecida uma pequena organização interna. Estreamos contra o Sporting com uma faixa, uma coreografica composta por 2000 rolos de papel e tínhamos realizado material como t-shirts e cachecóis. Certamente, uma data memorável.
No início, formaram-se alguns entraves, a mencionar, existência de alguns grupos na mesma bancada (como o ""LOD"" e ""MP""), o que veio a dificultar o nosso trabalho, e ainda o reduzido número de elementos dno Colectivo condicionava a evolução.
Nos anos seguintes, registou-se uma evolução significativa nos diferentes aspectos e melhoram bastante em termos de presenças e coreografias. Destaque para as primeiras deslocações ao estrangeiro - Milão e Manchester. Embora não tenhamos conseguido estar em todos os estádios, nestas primeiras épocas, melhorámos bastante neste ponto. Além disso, valorizámos não só o futebol como as outras modalidades amadoras (Hóquei, Basquetebol e Andebol) com as nossas assíduas presenças. Destaque ainda para as primeiras camionetas organizadas e para os primeiros númeors editados da Fanzone. Alguns momentos históricos do grupo foram por exemplo os ""0-5"" em pleno estádio da Luz para a Supertaça, o ""Penta"" e as ""grandes invasões"" feitas nesse ano à Luz e Alvalade.
2000 - O ano da revolução do Colectivo. No seio do grupo, os membros mais recentes, compreenderam que podiam fazer a organização evoluir mais e sentiram a necessidade de solidificar as raízes, criou-se o sentimento que faltava sempre mais qualquer coisa e a vontade e querer não podia parar... A estrutura foi remodelada, segmentaram-se as áreas e atribuíram-se responsabilidades. No final desse ano, surgiram os primeiros sinais de mudança, os ""Invicta Fans"" começaram a pupitar após a fusão entre a direcção e a jovem organização, formando um modelo de gestão inovador face à época, na alutra, composto por dez elementos.
Na sequência opta-se também pela mudança de nome para «Colectivo Ultras 95» devido sobretudo a duas razões: por um lado o CCN já nos parece um nome demasiado longo e que em termos de faixas, material, etc. não se adequava, por outro com o projecto do novo Estádio do Dragão e com a certeza de que o conceito de ""curva"" iria desaparecer e da possibilidade de junção com o outro Grupo Ultra, o nome da fundação deixava de fazer sentido. Como tal foi unânime a mudança de nome, que na verdade veio beneficiar bastante o grupo em termos de visibilidade.
As novas iniciativas do Grupo levaram a uma dinamização que leva à alteração da própria imagem. A Fanzine (posteriormente Revista) juntamente com o Sítio na Internet, deu um passo na afirmação do Colectivo.
Mas, a grande afirmação acabou por aparecer, no decorrer de uma das épocas de ouro do FC Porto, num jogo contra o Boavista, fizemos o 1º tifo inteiramente dedicado ao clube rival, devido à situação desportiva do clube com o mote ""Não se afoguem"". Foi numa dimensão modesta mas original e satírica! Para a Taça UEFA contra a Lázio, o «Não acordar, deixem-nos sonhar» deu nome à final de Sevilha (o Sonho) recordado ainda hoje; o primeiro lençol de grandes dimnensões (35mx40m) completamente desenhado e pintado por nós, considerada por muitos como o ponto de viragem nos tifos em Portugal. A curiosidade e destaque em toda a comunicação social foi enorme, e o Colectivo começava a ser verdadeiramente conhecido pela sua originialidade. Todos estes pontos de referência condicionaram à aproximação do grupo, especialmente de elementos não ligados à nossa cultura, levando a uma verdadeira ""explosão"" por parte de núcleos. Entre 2002/03 os ""Invicta Fans"" conseguiram concretizar todos os seus objectivos e constituíram o expoente máximo do C'95. O número de sócios duplicou em 365 dias para os 1000 elementos. Mais do que o saber ser e estar, conseguimos com que o Colectivo se afirmasse.
Entretanto surgiu uma nova fase para o Colectivo. Com a inauguração do Dragão e o sonho em ter uma curva forte e única que tornasse o nosso estádio num verdadeiro inferno já vinha de há muito, decidiu-se em consenso a mudança para a bancada Sul, para junto do outro Grupo Ultra. Esta estadia durou grande parte da época 2003/04, com os seus pontos fortes e fracos. Devido a vários problemas (como por exemplo o escasso número de bilhetes para ambos os grupos) optamos pela mudança e gresso (à revelia do clube) para a bancada Norte no início da época 04/05, onde conseguimos apenas um sector provisório no centro da bancada, nada bom para o grupo já que a ""vocalidade"" do sector era muito má. Depois de ultrapassadas várias divergências com a direcção do clube, conseguimos a mudança para o sector lateral da norte, com boas condições mas nunca com muitos ultras presentes. Os problemas pelos quais o Grupo passou afectaram de maneira notória o seu ""rendimento"". Ainda assim foi durante estes períodos mais conturbados que inauguramos a Sede, facilitantdo a preparação do material para os jogos. Paralelamente, à semana e fim-de-semana, tornou-se o ponto de encontro entre todos, permitindo um desenvolvimento organizacional fundamental para a nossa manutenção e crescimento.
Sensivelmente na mesma altura realizamos, provavelmente, as melhores coreografias, jamais feitas em terras lusitanas. Ambas contra o SL Benfica, a primeira com a elaboração de um bolo gigante a dar os parabéns pelos 10 anos consecutivos sem ser campeão e a segunda com uma rede gigante, redimensionada à alutra da bancada e dizia: ""ULTRAS FCPORTO"", autenticada pelo brasão do grupo. Tifo arrasador!
O ano de 2006 caracteriza-se com a perca de apoios da direcção do clube, após os acontecimentos com Co Adriaanse. Entretanto e já nos últimos meses do ano formamos a ""Associação Colectivo Ultras 95"", uma evolução organizativa, que pretendeu sobretudo salvaguardar as responsabilidades legais e financeiras do Grupo. Ainda assim e apesar do clube não nos reconhecer, continuámos a luta perante todos os obstáculos que nos eram colocados, pois o apoio incondicional ao clube é o eixo do C'95. Foi ainda nesta época que se deu o «reactivar» da nossa já mítica Fanzine, a ""Invicta Ultra""! Nota também para a presença de alguns dos nossos membros em Moscovo para o jogo contra o CSKA.
No ano de 2007, após o reatamento das relações com o Clube, era importante renovar a nossa imagem na internet! Assim, conseguimos concluir um projecto que começou em finais de 2005 e que culminou num novo e original site, sendo um dos melhores a nível europeu! O site foi inaugurado dias antes do jogo contra o Sporting, onde voltámos aos tifos, inovando mais uma vez ao escrevermos ""C 1995"" na bancada norte em estandartes brancos com plásticos azuis de fundo, criando um efeito tridimensional nas letras. No final do campeonato voltámos a inovar, ao celebrarmos com as quinas de campeão completadas com a palavra VENCER! Após o jogo, o grupo voltou a estar em destaque, ao fazer uma grande tochada e fumarada em frente ao varandim onde os jogadores vieram celebrar a conquista de mais um campeonato!
No início da nova época, novamente destaque para a coreografia contra o Sporting. Voltamos a erguer a rede que já tinhaf feito ""estragos"", mas desta feita com um novo conteúdo. O nosso novo brasão, ladeado de tiras plásticas de dois tons de azul. O Orgulho em ser Tripeiro estava bem alto novamente! De salientar as boas presenças na Turquia contra o Besiktas e também as boas deslocações à Luz e Alvalade.
Em 2008, o Grupo encontrava-se estável e de boa saúde. Voltámos a tifar contra o Benfica, usando desta feita tiras plásticas pintadas com o nosso dragão a envolver o brasão do Colectivo e as Quinas de Campeão, tudo isto completado com a frase: ""Saudemos o Tricampeão!"". Mais uma vez, estivemos bem representados em todos os jogos da Liga dos Campeões (a destacar os 11 membros presentes em Kiev e os 10 em Istambul contra o Fenerbahçe), ponto que temos vindo a melhor ano após ano! Novas e originais iniciativas foram realizadas, como a colocação de cartazes gigantes alusivos às novas inscrições no C95 por toda a cidade do Porto e arredores e a nova máquina de finos na sede, acções que visaram dinamizar e engrandecer o espírito de coesão de todo o grupo. Destaque também para a nova faixa do grupo para os jogos fora, num tamanho pouco convencional para o movimento português mas que encaixa perfeitamente em alguns jogos, especialmente nos estádios novos sem condições para faixas em comprimento

1602,"A galáxia do Olho Negro (Messier 64, NGC 4826) é uma galáxia espiral localizada a aproximadamente dezessete milhões de anos-luz (cerca de 5,2 megaparsecs) de distância na direção da constelação da Cabeleira de Berenice. Possui aproximadamente oitenta e seis mil anos-luz de diâmetro, uma magnitude aparente de +9,4, uma declinação de +21° 40' 58"" e uma ascensão reta de 12 horas, 56 minutos e 44,2 segundos.
A galáxia NGC 4826 é também conhecida como Galáxia do Olho Negro devido a sua extraordinária aparência escura com numerosos pontos brilhantes. A característica mais estranha e peculiar observada nesta galáxia diz respeito aos seus movimentos internos, enquanto os braços externos movem-se em uma direção, a parte interna move-se para outra direção, este fato é de difícil explicação, mas os cientistas acreditam na hipótese de que a galáxia NGC 4826 seja o resultado da colisão entre duas galáxias, uma grande e uma pequena.


== Descoberta e visualização ==
A galáxia espiral foi descoberta por Edward Pigott em 23 de março de 1779, apenas 12 dias antes de Johann Elert Bode resdescobrir independentemente o objeto, em 4 de abril daquele ano. Pouco menos de um ano depois, o astrônomo francês Charles Messier também redescobriu a galáxia, em 1 de março de 1780, catalogando-a como seu objeto 64. A descoberta original de Pigott passou despercebida até em 2002, quando Bryn Jones encontrou percebeu o fato no artigo de Pigott, pois a publicação de seu artigo ocorreu apenas em 11 de janeiro de 1781 na Royal Society, enquanto Bode e Messier publicaram no mesmo ano de suas respectivas descobertas.
A mancha escura, que dá nome à galáxia Olho Negro, já tinha sido observada por William Herschel, descobridor de Urano, em 1785 e 1789. Herschel, à época, já comparava o objeto a um ""olho negro"".
Pode ser vista com bons binóculos e suas características podem ser visualizadas com telescópios amadores pequenos e médios. A nuvem de poeira, o ""olho negro"", que obscurece boa parte da galáxia, pode ser vista com telescópios de abertura de 4 polegadas ou mais.


== Características ==

Também chamada de ""galáxia Bela Adormecida"", tem como principal características uma nuvem interestelar de poeira que obscurece parte da galáxia, visível mesmo em pequenos telescópios amadores. De acordo com James D. Wray, a galáxia pode estar passando por uma segunda onda de geração de novas estrelas. As estrelas contidas em seus braços são de idade intermediária, pois não há material interestelar suficiente para gerar novas estrelas. Entretanto, a matéria expelida por meio de vento estelar, supernovas e nebulosas planetárias se acumulou para formar uma nova geração de estrelas. Esta segunda onda de geração estelar alcançou aparentemente a região escura da galáxia.
Há dois sistemas de gás e poeira em seu disco que orbitam o núcleo da galáxia em sentidos opostos. A parte mais interna do disco, com 3 000 anos-luz de diâmetro gira em sentido contrário à parte mais externa, que se estende por mais de 40 000 anos-luz; a velocidade relativa entre a zona de contato dos dois discos é de 300 km/s e é uma região com vigorosa formação estelar, vista da Terra como pontos azuis embebidos em uma região com nuvens de poeira em um dos lados do núcleo galáctico.
Foi uma das primeiras galáxias a ter uma fonte de rádio detectada. Seu núcleo é razoávelmente ativo, e a galáxia é classificada, portanto, como uma galáxia Seyfert II. Sua distância em relação à Terra não é ponto comum entre os astrônomos; as estimativas variam entre 12 e 44 milhões de anos-luz. Sua velocidade em relação à Terra é de 377 km/s, o que, segundo a lei de Hubble, sugeriria uma distância de 16 milhões de anos-luz. Porém, a galáxia se move em direção ao aglomerado de Virgem e essa componente da velocidade não é determinada. As pesquisas mais recentes, do Space Telescope Science Institute, estimam a distância em 19 milhões de anos-luz.
Seu diâmetro aparente na esfera celeste é de 9,3 minutos de grau, que equivale a um diâmetro real de 51 000 anos-luz. Sua magnitude aparente 8,5 corresponde a uma magnitude absoluta de -20,3. A galáxia faz parte do grupo de galáxias M94, da qual faz parte Messier 94 e a pequena galáxia irreguar UGC 8024, além de outras galáxias menores.

Zayn anunciou o lançamento do single através de mídias sociais. A canção é o primeiro single do futuro segundo álbum de estúdio de Malik. A canção estreou nas rádios americanas em 24 de março de 2017.


== Composição ==
A canção, produzida por [Murda Beatz e Frank Dukes, foi descrita pela revista The Fader como uma ""canção pop inspirada em dancehall, com uma batida lenta e tropical""; e pelo site Entertainment.ie como ""uma fatia suave e de lamber os dedos de r'n'b com auto-tune.


== Recepção Crítica ==
Taylor Weather, da revista Billboard, elogiou a faixa dizendo que ""a mais recente canção de Malik é um hino esperançoso (e altamente cativante) para as garotas que não são tão sortudas quanto Hadid"". Ele também observou seu ""ritmo eletrônico e forte guitarra"", enquanto a revista PopCrush seu ""ritmo suave de verão"".
Alguns compararam a canção com a música tema do desenho animado Rugrats, bem como com canções do cantor canadense Drake.

1604,"O jab é um soco empregue nas artes marciais. Existem diversas variações de jab, contudo todas elas possuem características em comum. Com o braço dianteiro da posição base, o punho é impulsionado frontalmente até que todo o membro anterior se encontre completamente estendido. No momento do impacto, a pronação do punho é normalmente realizada com uma orientação horizontal, onde a palma da mão deve situar-se virada para o chão.


== Etimologia ==
A palavra jab foi usada pela primeira vez em 1825, para significar ""empurra para um ponto"". O termo é uma variante escocesa da palavra ""job"", que significa ""golpear"", ""perfurar"" ou ""impulso"".

1614,"Thriller jurídico é um gênero de thriller e romance policial caracterizado pela presença de um advogado ou promotor, que tem e provar diante do júri a culpabilidade ou inocência de um indivíduo.


== Características do thriller jurídico ==
Como todos os romances policiais, os thrillers jurídicos tem geralmente a presença de um crime, porém há algumas diferenças, pois os thrillers jurídicos são geralmente protagonizados por advogados e não por detetives. Nesse gênero de romance policial, o advogado precisa ir ao tribunal e provar a culpa ou a inocência de alguém, seja num processo de assassinato, roubo, sequestro, etc. Os thrillers jurídicos geralmente são baseados na lei do seu país de origem, portanto raras vezes são citadas situações que não possam ocorrer em uma situação real.


=== Autores do gênero ===
Um dos primeiros e mais bem sucedidos autores a explorar o gênero thriller jurídico foi Erle Stanley Gardner, com o advogado fictício Perry Mason, o autor que era advogado se baseou em fatos que realmente enfrentou em sua profissão, acrescentando outros mais interessantes para o leitor, como assassinatos, roubos, corrupção policial etc. Entre os seus principais livros estão The Case of the Sulky Girl (O Caso da Jovem Arisca) e The Case of the Lucky Legs (O Caso da Fotografia Misteriosa), o sucesso do personagem acabou inspirando uma série de televisão baseada no personagem.
Os norte-americanos John Grisham, Scott Turow e John Hart são atualmente alguns dos mais influentes autores de thrillers jurídicos.

Leonard, que atua ao lado de Ella Hall, sendo o terceiro seriado produzido pela Universal Pictures. Esse seriado é considerado perdido, pois apenas fragmentos estão preservados na Library of Congress.


== Sinopse ==
Fonte: 
Um vaso oriental contém instruções secretas para um rico filão de minérios. Depois de encontrar um rico filão de ouro, Tom Gallon (Wilbur Higby) atira em seu parceiro Harry Wilkerson (Harry Carter) e foge de barco a partir de San Francisco, com medo de ser acusado de assassinato.
Anos mais tarde, Gallon, que perdera a chave do baú que continha o vaso em um naufrágio, ainda sofre com a incômoda suspeita de que Wilkerson ainda possa estar vivo. E, realmente, a vítima do suposto assassinato se transforma em superintendente de minas, tendo em mente a idéia da chantagem em sua mente, ao lado da tempestuosa Jean Darnell (Jean Hathaway).
John Dore (interpretado pelo diretor Robert Z. Leonard), um engenheiro de minas que vem para o resgate da inevitável donzela em apuros, Ruth (Ella Hall), filha de Tom Gallon. A batalha se segue, com o nefasto Wilkerson levando John e Ruth de Nova York a San Francisco e a Los Angeles, mostrando ser uma das peças mais populares de escapismo dos seriados do início da era silenciosa. O futuro astro Jack Holt teve no filme uma das suas primeiras oportunidades, como o capanga de vilões.

1616,"Após a eleições gerais de 1994, a África do Sul elegeu pela primeira vez na sua história um governante negro, após mais de quarenta anos sob o regime segregacionista do apartheid, na pessoa do ativista Nelson Mandela, que estivera preso por cerca de 28 anos e fora libertado em 1989, para levar a termo a transição do regime exclusionista para uma democracia plena, no que passou à história como a ""refundação"" do país.
Mandela tornara-se, assim, o Pai da Pátria de sua nação, que passou por radicais mudanças em sua estrutura no período 1994-1999: novos símbolos nacionais foram criados, uma nova constituição foi aprovada, e todos - brancos, negros, indianos e mestiços passaram a gozar de igualdade de direitos.
Com algumas ações controversas e criticadas como a má distribuição de renda, corrupção crescente ou a intervenção militar no Lesoto, Mandela deu início a um período de hegemonia política de seu partido - o Congresso Nacional Africano (CNA) - elegendo seu sucessor e mantendo a maioria do eleitorado.


== Principais fatos da administração Mandela ==
Realizada a votação em 27 de abril de 1994, Mandela tomou posse em 10 de maio daquele ano; o CNA obteve 62% dos votos. Apesar disto, foi formado um Governo de Unidade Nacional, e ficou o representante do Partido Nacional, o ex-presidente Frederik de Klerk como primeiro-vice-presidente, e Thabo Mbeki do CNA como segundo-vice.
Um dos passos simbólicos na reconciliação do país foi dado pelo novo presidente, em 1995, quando a África do Sul sediou a Copa do Mundo de Rúgbi daquele ano e a até então odiada seleção nacional, composta por atletas brancos e apelidada de Springboks, recebeu o apoio do presidente que encorajou os negros a também apoiarem-na; O time local sagrou-se campeão, após uma vitória épica na final contra a Seleção Neozelandesa, e Mandela fez a entrega do troféu ao capitão Francois Pienaar, um africâner, vestindo uma camisa do time com o número 6 - igual à de Pienaar.
Em face da situação caótica que ocorria no Lesoto, Mandela ordenou a primeira intervenção militar pós-apartheid, em setembro de 1998, a fim de proteger a administração do primeiro-ministro Pakalitha Mosisili - cuja eleição havia gerado uma reação feroz da oposição, ameaçando o seu instável governo.
Críticos e analistas, inclusive ativistas contra a AIDS a exemplo de Edwin Cameron, tecem duros comentários acerca da ineficácia de seu governo em conter o avanço da doença. Após sua aposentadoria o próprio Mandela admitiu que falhou por não haver dedicado maior atenção à epidemia. Desde então ele dedicou maior atenção à questão.


=== Reformas sociais ===
Durante o curso de seu mandato uma vasta gama de reformas sociais progressivas foram decretadas, visando reduzir o grande fosso de desigualdades sociais e econômicas. Entre as medidas adotadas por Mandela e seus Ministros estão:
Introdução de cuidados de saúde gratuitos (1994) para todas as crianças menores de seis anos de idade, juntamente com as mulheres grávidas e lactantes, com uso das instalações do setor de saúde pública (medida que foi estendida a todos aqueles que necessitam do nível primário do setor de saúde pública, em 1996).
Aumento nos gastos sociais, com ampliação nos investimentos públicos em previdência e em subvenções sociais em 13% no período 1996/97, 13% 1997/98 e 7% em 1998/99.
Pagamento equânime dos subsídios por invalidez, subsídios para manutenção da criança e pensões por velhice, que anteriormente eram definidos em diferentes níveis para os diversos grupos raciais.
Inclusão das crianças da zona rural nos subsídios para manutenção da criança, que o sistema anteriormente excluía.
Aumento significativo dos gastos públicos com educação, crescendo as despesas em 25% em 1996/97, 7% em 1997/98 e 4% em 1998/99.
A Lei de Restituição de Terras, de 1994, que permitiu que as pessoas que tiveram suas propriedades perdidas pelo Natives Land Act de 1913 pudessem reclamá-las de
volta, resolvendo assim milhares de reivindicações de terra.

As equações de Colebrook-White e de Darcy-Weisbach visam avaliar a influência desta rugosidade.


== Introdução ==
A hidráulica de tubulações, apresenta aspectos práticos que envolvem a análise do escoamento de fluidos incompressíveis em condutos forçados e uniformes, em regime permanente levando em consideração as condições de escoamento que tratam de vazão, velocidade, diâmetro e perda de carga.
Entende-se por conduto forçado aquele no qual o fluido escoa à plena seção e sob pressão. Muitas vezes os condutos de seção circular são chamados de tubos ou tubulações. Um conduto é dito uniforme quando a sua seção transversal não varia com o seu comprimento. Se a vazão do fluido em qualquer seção do conduto não variar com o tempo, o regime de escoamento é dito permanente.
A densidade dos líquidos, ao contrário do que se passa com os gases, varia muito pouco quando se varia a sua pressão ou temperatura. A título de exemplo, considerando que a água tem compressibilidade igual a 5.10−5 cm2/kgf, isto significa que em condições normais seria necessário um incremento de pressão de 20 kgf/cm2 para que um litro de água se reduza de 1 cm3, ou seja, para que sua densidade aumente um milésimo. Por isto, do ponto de vista prático, a densidade da água e da maioria dos líquidos é independente da temperatura e da pressão.
Diante dessa reduzidíssima variação da densidade, nos escoamentos de líquidos em regime permanente considera-se que os mesmos se comportam como incompressíveis. Neste contexto se incluem querosene, gasolina, álcool, óleo diesel, água, vinho, vinhoto, leite e muitos outros, aos quais se aplicam os conceitos aqui comentados.


== Escoamento ==
É conveniente ressaltar que um escoamento se classifica também como turbulento ou laminar. No escoamento laminar há um caminhamento disciplinado das partículas fluidas, seguindo trajetórias regulares, sendo que as trajetórias de duas partículas vizinhas não se cruzam. Já no escoamento turbulento a velocidade num dado ponto varia constantemente em grandeza e direção, com trajetórias irregulares, e podendo uma mesma partícula ora localizar-se próxima do eixo do tubo, ora próxima da parede do tubo.
Em geral, o regime de escoamento na condução de líquidos no interior de tubulações é turbulento, exceto em situações especiais, tais como escoamento a baixíssimas vazões, como ocorre em gotejadores de irrigação, onde o escoamento é laminar.
Sempre que um líquido escoa no interior de um tubo de um ponto para outro, haverá uma certa perda de energia denominada perda de pressão ou perda de carga. Esta perda de energia é devida ao atrito com as paredes do tubo e devida à viscosidade do líquido em escoamento. Quanto maior for a rugosidade da parede da tubulação, isto é, a altura das asperezas, maior será a turbulência do escoamento e, logo, maior será a perda de carga.


== Teoria ==
Já há cerca de dois séculos estudos e pesquisas vem sendo realizados, procurando estabelecer leis que possam reger as perdas de carga em condutos. Várias fórmulas empíricas foram estabelecidas no passado e algumas empregadas até com alguma confiança em diversas aplicações de engenharia, como as fórmulas de Hazen-Williams, de Manning de Flamant, etc. Mas, trabalhos de diversos investigadores tem mostrado que, em sua totalidade, são mais ou menos incorretas. A incorreção dessas fórmulas é tanto maior quanto mais amplo é o domínio de aplicação pretendido por seus autores.
Atualmente a expressão mais precisa e usada universalmente para análise de escoamento em tubos, que foi proposta em 1845, é a conhecida equação de Darcy-Weisbach:

Obviamente, trata-se de uma equação implícita, isto é, a variável 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   aparece nos dois membros da equação, de forma não ser possível explicitá-la. Mas isto não sugere que seja impossível resolver equações implícitas. Os métodos numéricos, embora aproximativos, são capazes de resolver equações implícitas com a precisão que se desejar. São métodos basicamente computacionais pois incorrem em operações matemáticas repetidas. Encontram, contudo, muita utilidade em hidráulica.
É o caso dos métodos iterativos, nos quais ordena-se adequadamente a equação, e arbitra-se um valor inicial qualquer para a variável procurada que está no seu segundo membro. Com o valor inicial já arbitrado, calcula-se um novo valor para esta mesma variável procurada, mas para a que está no primeiro membro. Se a diferença entre o valor inicial e o novo valor calculado estiver fora da precisão desejada, repete-se esta operação, porém colocando como valor inicial o novo valor calculado. Se a diferença aumentar diz-se que os valores estão divergindo, e se diminuir diz-se que os valores estão convergindo para a solução. O número de repetições, isto é, o número de iterações poderá ser pequeno ou não, dependendo do método a ser utilizado, e se sucederá até que a diferença seja suficientemente pequena ou compatível com a precisão desejada.
Um esquema básico de cálculo, passo a passo, seria algo do tipo:
Arbitra-se um valor inicial qualquer para a variável do segundo membro.
Calcula-se novo valor para a mesma variável que está no primeiro membro.
Compara-se a diferença entre o valor calculado e o valor inicial com a tolerância estabelecida.
Se maior, o novo valor passa a ser o valor inicial, e volta-se para o passso (2). Se menor passa-se para o passo (5).
O corrente valor da variável é o valor procurado.
Métodos iterativos como o de Newton são muito potentes e convergem muito rapidamente, podendo alcançar resultados altamente precisos com três ou quatro iterações.
Na prática, em termos específicos, a análise do escoamento em tubos basicamente envolve três grandezas a se calcular:
o diâmetro
a vazão (ou velocidade)
a perda de carga
Estas são em síntese, as três variáveis principais envolvidas no cálculo hidráulico, pois as demais (material do tubo, tipo de líquido, temperatura, etc), são especificadas pelo projeto. Por qualquer método que viermos a empregar, para se determinar qualquer uma dessas três variáveis, as duas demais deverão ser conhecidas ou estimadas.
Em que pese a técnica iterativa associada à precisão das equações dar um pouco de velocidade ao cálculo, contudo permanece o mesmo sendo realizado manualmente, o que não deixa de ser cansativo, enfadonho e sujeito a erros. Com o uso de algoritmos, a resolução torna-se simples, fácil, automática e rápida. Entretanto, devem ser observados os erros recorrentes de qualquer método computacional devido aos erros inerentes à operações matemáticas usando números com várias casas decimais em computadores.
Há um artigo bem orientativo, denominado Análise de escoamento em condutos forçados. Uso das equações de Darcy-Weisbach e de Colebrook-White, que trata desse assunto de forma bem didática, inclusive com o uso de programas de cálculo para computadores digitais.

1627,"Venham mais Cinco é um álbum de canções originais de José Afonso. Foi gravado em Paris com a ajuda de José Mário Branco e editado no Natal de 1973, sendo o último álbum de José Afonso antes da Revolução de Abril.


== Significado Histórico ==
Na época em que este álbum foi concebido, José Afonso estava a cantar um pouco por todo o lado como símbolo antifascista de oposição ao Estado Novo Português.
Quando o disco foi lançado ao mercado, a cançonetista Maria Antonieta, à época elemento do Coro Feminino da Emissora Nacional, e organizadora da música gravada na Secção de Arquivos Musicais, da Repartição de Programas Musicais, da Direcção dos Serviços de Programas da Emissora Nacional, adquiriu o disco numa loja especializada, e submeteu o disco à Censura, que proibiu-o de imediato, e comunicou a decisão à PIDE/DGS, que procedeu logo à sua apreensão imediata.
Muitas sessões musicais de José Afonso foram proibidas pela PIDE/DGS e, em Abril de 1973 ele foi detido no Forte-prisão de Caxias onde esteve até finais de Maio.
Aquando da Revolução, este disco foi um dos primeiros discos proibidos a serem transmitidos na rádio, principalmente no Rádio Clube Português.


== Descrição do álbum ==
Neste disco, o cantantor assina algumas das suas canções que se tornaram clássicas, como ""Venham Mais Cinco"", ""A Formiga no Carreiro"" ou ""Que Amor Não me Engana"", mas também alguns poemas de cariz quase surrealista, como ""Rio Largo de Profundis"", ""Nefretite Não Tinha Papeira"" ou ""Era uma Redondo Vocábulo"", cujo poema foi escrito no período de detenção em Caxias, e que também se tornou num dos seus maiores clássicos.

1629,"Um planeta desértico é um planeta com um único ou maioritário bioma climático, desértico, com pouca ou nenhuma precipitação. Marte é considerado um planeta desértico, por definição, embora o termo é aplicado principalmente aos planetas que podem se tornar habitável, ao contrário de um planetas estéreis.
É um tema relativamente comum na ficção científica, o conceito inclui ambos os planetas reais e fictícios e, por vezes acompanhados por elementos do despotismo hidráulico. Talvez os exemplos mais famosos da ficção são Arrakis, o cenário para a maior parte da série Duna de romances de Frank Herbert e Tatooine do universo Star Wars.


== Habitabilidade ==
Um estudo recente sugeriu que os planetas desértico não só tem a capacidade de suportar a vida, mas pode ser mais comum do que planetas como a Terra. Esta previsão baseia-se em sua maior zona habitável em relação a planetas com água líquida.
No mesmo estudo também se especulou que Vênus pode ter sido um planeta desértico habitável até há um bilhões de anos atrás. Acredita-se que o mesmo pode ter ocorrido em Marte quando perdeu seus oceanos, e que a vida marciana pode ter existido em tempos mais recentes e ainda hoje, refugiando-se em aquíferos subterrâneos. A própria Terra, como resultado do crescimento do Sol, vai se tornar um planeta desértico em um bilhão de anos.
Apesar do que normalmente se pensa, um mundo desértico habitável provavelmente não precisa de ter um clima completamente uniforme. Provavelmente, teria um pouco de água perto da superfície dos seus polos, embora o padrão de tempo depende em grande parte os outros organismos, ao longo da inclinação axial.
O estudo realizado em 2013 concluiu que pode haver planeta desértico quente sem efeito estufa fugitivo a 0,5 UA em torno de estrelas semelhantes ao Sol. Nesse estudo, concluiu-se que é necessário no mínimo 1% de umidade para limpar o dióxido de carbono na atmosfera, mas água demasiada pode atuar como um gás de efeito estufa. Pressões atmosféricas mais altas aumentam a gama onde a água pode permanecer líquida.

Mesmo porque seu resultado é capaz de retratar o nível de desenvolvimento de cada cidade e, assim, dar uma ideia sobre a qualidade de vida de seus cidadãos.
O IFDM é semelhante ao Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano (IDH), calculado pela ONU. Uma diferença entre ambos é que os dados do IFDM “podem ser coletados todo ano”, ao passo que os do IDH só são levantados uma vez por década, pois dependem de “dados do censo demográfico, realizado a cada 10 anos.”


== Categorias ==

O índice varia de zero (valor mínimo) até 1 (valor máximo), sendo considerado:
Alto, resultados superiores a 0,8 pontos;
Moderado, resultados entre 0,6 e 0,8 pontos;
Regular, resultados entre 0,4 e 0,6 pontos;
Baixo, resultados inferiores a 0,4 pontos;

== Família ==
Sancha foi a única filha e segunda criança nascida do rei Afonso VII de Leão e Castela e de sua segunda esposa, Riquilda da Polônia.

1640,"Philipp Jakob Spener (Rappoltsweiler, Alsácia, 13 de janeiro de 1635 — Berlim, 5 de fevereiro de 1705) foi um teólogo luterano alemão, nascido na Alsácia-Lorena, então parte do Sacro Império Romano-Germânico (atualmente, uma região administrativa francesa), considerado o pai do Pietismo protestante. Foi um autodidata que cedo percebeu o fato da Reforma Protestante não estar completa. Em sua vida, entrou em contato com importantes teólogos e seus livros, tendo estes exercido influência direta em suas obras posteriores.
Sendo luterano, evocou das obras de Martinho Lutero um pouco de sua ortodoxia, como a salvação e justificação concedidas pela graça de Deus, mediante a fé somente e todas as questões que foram essenciais à Reforma do século XVI. Achava o Cristianismo de sua época muito decadente, pois os pastores e membros de suas igrejas eram muito acomodados e frios com relação à vida espiritual. Também se considerava apto a continuar a Reforma de Lutero, passando a fazer pregações e reunindo os collegia pietatis, minúsculos grupos de pessoas que se propunham a estudar e debater a Bíblia.
Com isso, surgiram os movimentos de comunhão do século XVII, que, apesar de não se desfiliarem das igrejas instituídas, contribuíram mais tarde para que emergissem o pietismo clássico, o pietismo radical, os movimentos de avivamento do século XIX nos Estados Unidos e o movimento carismático do século XX.
Spener tinha em mente o fato de que não adiantava ir à igreja e viver dançando, indo ao teatro e participando de jogos. Que aqueles que tinham abraçado a fé cristã, mas tinham esfriado, tinham que ser levados a um renascimento, do contrário estariam perdidos. Suas ideias também tiveram início ao ler obras do teólogo J. Arndt e ao estudar com o professor Christian Danhauer na faculdade teológica de Estrasburgo.

Trata-se de um parque temático concebido e construído como um espaço lúdico, pedagógico e turístico, para mostrar aspectos da cultura e do património português, em Portugal e no mundo.


== História ==
Foi iniciado em 1938, por iniciativa do professor Bissaya Barreto, com projeto do arquiteto Cassiano Branco, vindo a ser inaugurado em 8 de junho de 1940, razão pela qual a sua concepção e arquitetura estão fortemente imbuídas do espírito idealista e nacionalista do Estado Novo Português. A sua construção desenvolveu-se em três etapas:
A primeira fase, entre 1938 e 1940, é constituída pelo conjunto de casas regionais portuguesas: solares de Trás-os-Montes e Minho, casas típicas de cada região do país com pomares, hortas e jardins, capelas, azenhas e pelourinhos. A este núcleo, pertence também o conjunto de Coimbra, espaço onde se encontram representados os monumentos mais importantes da cidade;
A segunda fase integra a chamada ""área monumental"", espaço ilustrativo dos monumentos mais representativos, de norte a sul do país.
A terceira fase, concluída em finais da década de 1950, engloba a representação monumental e etnográfica das então províncias ultramarinas em África, do Brasil, de Macau, do Estado Português da Índia e de Timor Português, cercados por exemplares da flora nativa destas regiões. Compreende também as representações dos arquipélagos dos Açores e da Madeira.
No ""Centro de Documentação Bissaya Barreto"" existem diversos documentos sobre a história do parque, nomeadamente plantas, desenhos arquitetónicos e cartões-postais antigos.
O parque tem vindo a ter um decréscimo no número de visitantes desde 2009, tendo registado em 2014 228 mil visitantes, menos 19% do que em 2005, em que registaram 283 mil entradas.
Nos últimos anos, 2007 teve o melhor registo, com 331 mil, e 2012 o pior, com 211 mil visitantes.


== Características ==
O parque caracteriza-se por apresentar construções em escala reduzida representando monumentos e outros elementos sobre a cultura e o património edificado português, em Portugal e no mundo. Em nossos dias organiza-se em sete zonas complementares:
Países de Língua Oficial Portuguesa;
Portugal Insular (Açores e Madeira);
Portugal Monumental;
Coimbra;
Casas Regionais;
Casa da Criança; e
Parque Infantil.
Complementarmente o visitante pode conhecer alguns museus temáticos:
Museu do Traje;
Museu da Marinha; e
Museu do Mobiliário.
O espaço conta ainda com casas de banho, loja de presentes e cafetaria.

Está localizada na Rota do Sol, no município de Parnamirim, a 12 km de Natal, capital do estado brasileiro do Rio Grande do Norte. Nela se concentram operações de lançamento de foguetes de pequeno e de médio porte. A instalação trouxe a Natal a alcunha de ""Capital espacial do Brasil"".
O local foi escolhido pois é próximo do equador magnético; aproveitava o suporte logístico já existente; a região apresenta baixo índice pluviométrico; grande área de impacto representado pelo oceano e condições de ventos predominantemente favoráveis.
O centro é aberto a visitação da população e turistas, porém deve-se fazer um agendamento. Em março de 2011, a então presidente Dilma Rousseff passou o carnaval no hotel de trânsito da base, permanecendo isolada, aproveitando a segurança das instalações.
A faixa de praia da base, por estar protegida do acesso do público externo, tornou-se uma importante área de reprodução de tartarugas marinhas, sob a supervisão do Projeto Tamar.


== Etimologia ==
O local da base é vizinho ao campo dunar do bairro de Ponta Negra, região denominada ""Barreira do Inferno"" por pescadores porque, ao amanhecer, os reflexos do sol tornam as falésias do local vermelhas como fogo.


== Lançamentos ==

O Nike Apache, foi o primeiro foguete a ser lançado desta base. Ocorreu em 15 de dezembro de 1965 e era um foguete de sondagem de fabricação dos Estados Unidos.
Nesta base já foram lançados mais de 400 foguetes, desde os pequenos foguetes de sondagem meteorológica do tipo Loki, até veículos de alta performance da classe Castor-Lance, de quatro estágios.
Dois experimentos envolvendo o INPE, a NASA e o CLBI merecem destaque: Projeto Exametnet – para estudos da atmosfera em altitudes de 30 a 60 km, quando foram realizadas 88 operações entre 1966 e 1978, totalizando 207 lançamentos; e o projeto Ozônio – para estudar a camada de ozônio, com um total de 81 lançamentos, entre 1978 e 1990.
No que se refere a lançamentos orbitais, em particular equatoriais, o CLBI presta serviços de rastreio e de segurança de veículos satelizadores lançados do Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara (CLA). Uma outra ação desenvolvida no Centro e que merece destaque é a intensa cooperação com a Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA), através da atividade de rastreamento do veículo Ariane, desde seu voo inaugural.


== Atuais atividades da base ==
As atuais atividades da base são:
Rastreamento do veículo lançador Ariane, em conjunto com o Centro Espacial Francês no (Kourou, Guiana Francesa), em conformidade com o estabelecido em um acordo com a Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA).
Continuação dos testes e experimentos de interesse do Comando da Aeronáutica.
Disponibilização dos meios operacionais em proveito de experimentos de interesse da Marinha e do Exército Brasileiro, visando, além da participação de projetos de interesse da Força Aérea Brasileira, incremento da cooperação entre as Forças Armadas
Venda de serviços de lançamentos e rastreamentos de foguetes suborbitais para organizações nacionais e estrangeiras, colocando os meios operacionais à disposição da comunidade científica internacional para a realização de operações espaciais, em especial aquelas relacionadas com a pesquisa e o monitoramento do meio ambiente, principalmente através da observação da atmosfera. Tal como é o projeto EXAMETNET que foi dirigido para o estudo da atmosfera na faixa entre 30 a 60 km de altitude.

1668,"Virar em roda (português europeu) ou Dar um Jaibe (português brasileiro), Gybe (En) - são os termos náuticos empregues para descrever as manobra a efectuar quando um veleiro que navega na mesma direcção do vento - barco ao vento- como em popa ou popa rasada, muda de direcção de forma a recebar o vento na amura do outro bordo.
Manobra ainda mais delicada que Virar por davante exige uma coordenação sem falha entre o membro da equipagem que se ocupa da barra - o homem do lema, o timoneiro - e do resto da equipagem.


== Sequência da manobra ==
Os números referem-se à imagem ""Virar em roda/Cambada, Gybe""


=== Vento ligeiro ===
manobrar o leme para provocar a mudança de direcção (2),
a vela grande não recebe vento e, a bater, atravessa o eixo da embarcação levando consigo a retranca (3),
o timoneiro estabiliza o leme na posição desejada enquanto os membros da equipagem manobram, caçando os cabos de forma a estabelecerem as vela na outra amura (5).
Nos monotipos ligeiro e com vento ligeiro o virar em roda controlado pode ser efectuado metendo-se em popa rasada, e pegando na escota da retranca fazê-la passar para o outro bordo. -


=== Vento forte ===

Com vento forte - Brisa moderada (Beaufort 4) - a retranca passa de um bordo ao outro com uma velocidade proporcional à do vento e num barco ligeiro o movimento pode ser muito perigoso, não só pela retranca poder ferir alguém e/ou chegando ao ponto de poder haver o risco de capotar (voltar-se).
A sequência da manobra com vento forte pode ser a seguinte:
manobrar o leme para provocar a mudança de direcção,
caçar tão rapidamente quanto possível a escota da vela grande,
o homem do leme mantém a embarcação o maior tempo possível em popa rasada, (vento absolutamente pela popa),
uma vez que a retranca passou o leito do vento:
folgar a vela de um maneira controlada,
um nó na ponto adequada impedirá a retranca de ir bater nos brandais,
o burro está preso ao máximo para impedir a retranca de subir.

a manobra à proa (Vela de estai, Genoa, Balão) pode se efectuar antes ou depois do viramento em roda. -


== Risco ==
O maior risco, principalmente com vento forte, é o do barco se deitar quando devido a uma falsa manobra ou a uma rajada de vento, a nave parte para a orça.

Segundo a constituição, o seu objetivo principal é proteger a independência e a soberania do Estado e garantir a integridade territorial da nação. As forças armadas da Geórgia são submetidas ao Ministério da Defesa, com o poder investido na figura do Presidente como o Comandante em Chefe.
Após ganhar sua independência no começo da década de 1990, a ex república soviética da Geórgia tinha um pequeno exército, criado no padrão das Forças Armadas da União Soviética. No começo da década de 2000, o país buscou uma maior aproximação com o Ocidente, especialmente com os Estados Unidos. Os americanos passaram a fornecer armas aos georgianos que, em apoio, enviaram tropas para o Kosovo, Iraque e Afeganistão.
Durante a guerra Russo-Georgiana de 2008, o país perdeu uma enorme quantidade de equipamentos militares. Contudo, após o conflito, a Geórgia reconstruiu suas forças armadas, importando material dos Estados Unidos e, principalmente, da Europa oriental. Em 2009, o seu poderio militar já era superior do que antes da guerra contra a Rússia no ano anterior.

1682,"Belarmino (1964) é um documentário português de longa-metragem realizado por Fernando Lopes, sobre o pugilista Belarmino Fragoso.
É um dos primeiros filmes da geração do Novo Cinema português, inspirado pela Nouvelle Vague francesa mas sempre fiel ao neo-realismo, cujo pioneiro no cinema português foi Manuel Guimarães, na década anterior.
No caso de Belarmino, há marcas evidentes de Rocco e seus Irmãos (1960), de Visconti, no tema, no enquadramento social do problema, e de Chronique d'un été (1961) de Jean Rouch, na sua abordagem pelo documentário, pelo cinema directo com recurso à entrevista. Essa entrevista foi conduzida pelo jornalista e escritor Baptista-Bastos. É uma docuficção.
O filme estreou no cinema Aviz, em Lisboa, a 19 de Novembro de 1964

Rodagem : Agosto de 1963
Formato: 35 mm p/b
Género: documentário (biografia)
Estreia: cinema Aviz, em Lisboa, a 19 de Novembro de 1964


== Sinopse ==

Belarmino é um antigo campeão de boxe, de humildes origens, que teve momentos de glória mas que o capital explorou. Nutre-se agora de memórias, sofre de nostalgia. Vive como um marginal, deambulando pela cidade de Lisboa. Para ganhar a vida é engraxador e pinta fotografias.


== Enquadramento histórico ==
O início da década de sessenta é marcado pela agitação social (greves universitárias), por importantes movimentações da esquerda, clandestina, por um certo bulício cultural e editorial que a PIDE perseguia. Germinando nos meios universitários, fanáticos de certos filmes que viam nos seus cine-clubes, inúmeros intelectuais marcariam presença na vida do seu país até ao final da década. Mergulhado nesse contexto, Belarmino espelha com certa nitidez o modo de ver as coisas que uma geração sofrida mas rebelde se impunha.

1686,"Mestre é uma localidade pertencente ao município de Veneza, Itália. Está situada em terra firme, frente às ilhas de Veneza.
A população residente no núcleo da lagoa de Veneza é de 70 000 habitantes, enquanto que o conjunto dos outros dois núcleos de Mestre e Marghera ultrapassa os 200 000.
O centro histórico da Veneza insular vive principalmente do turismo, presente todo o ano, enquanto que Mestre cresceu graças ao polo industrial de Marghera.
Há um projeto para separar Mestre de Veneza, criando dois municípios (comunas) distintos, mas nos quatro referendos populares celebrados em 1979, 1989, 1994 e 2003, os cidadãos expressaram-se contra a separação.

1688,"Tales de Azevedo (Salvador, 26 de agosto de 1904 — Salvador, 5 de agosto de 1995) foi um médico, antropólogo, historiador, jornalista, professor e escritor brasileiro, vencedor do Prêmio Machado de Assis, lente nas universidades Federal da Bahia e de Colúmbia, além de articulista na imprensa.
Originalmente laborando exclusivamente na clínica médica e magistério, Azevedo passou a dedicar-se às ciências sociais, onde alcançou notoriedade em estudos que abordavam o preconceito, miscigenação e ascensão social.
Sobre seus estudos comportamentais do cotidiano o professor universitário novaiorquino John Collig afirmou, em 2015, ""Eu o vejo à frente do seu tempo. Um etnógrafo, com formação em medicina, que se interessou nas formas sentimentais, da vida, do afeto, do corpo, do desejo, da movimentação em praças públicas, de uma forma que só agora estamos retomando esses discursos"".


== Biografia ==
Tales Olímpio Góes de Azevedo era filho de Ormindo Azevedo e Laurinda Góes de Azevedo; Seu pai era farmacêutico, e dono de uma tradicional farmácia na Praça da Piedade, e sua mãe professora; o casal teve cinco filhos dos quais Tales foi o primogênito.
Fez sua formação elementar no jesuíta Colégio Antônio Vieira, onde integrou a turma de alunos capitaneada pelo padre Luiz Soares Cabral que se compunha de nomes como Anísio Teixeira e outros que se celebrizaram na Bahia; após a conclusão do secundário vai trabalhar na firma de um padrinho, ali ficando de 1919 até 1922 quando, por influência de Frederico Edelweiss, resolve prosseguir os estudos, ingressando naquele ano na faculdade de medicina.

Ainda quando estudante passa a colaborar na imprensa do estado, em publicações da capital e também em Ilhéus, e em publicações católicas; trabalha como revisor no Diário Oficial da Bahia e aprende o trabalho tipográfico; em 1925 passa a trabalhar no Diário da Bahia e depois muda-se para A Tarde onde é incentivado por seu proprietário, Ernesto Simões Filho, atividade que lhe permite ampliar o círculo de amizades e influências.
Formando-se em 1927, trabalha na clínica até o final da década de 1930 quando em 1940 tem o interesse despertado, sob influência de Josué de Castro, para a medicina social quando realiza no Rio de Janeiro um curso sobre alimentação e nutrição.
As ciências sociais então passam a ocupar-lhe o centro das atenções, o que é reforçado com seu ingresso no quadro de docentes da recém criada Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras da atual UFBa em 1943; em 1949, sendo Anísio Teixeira secretário estadual da educação, foi por este convidado a realizar pesquisas junto à Universidade de Colúmbia; mais tarde, pela Unesco, realizou estudos de relações raciais no Brasil, produzindo então seu estudo de maior reconhecimento na área — As elites de cor: um estudo de ascensão social, que foi publicado inicialmente em Paris em 1953. Aposentou-se do magistério em 1967; em 1971 leciona na Universidade de Colúmbia; nesta época seu interesse antropológico se concentra em aspectos de aparência menor no comportamento.
Em 1975, com a reformulação de A Tarde, Simões Filho o coloca como um dos seis colaboradores permanentes do jornal, para o qual Azevedo colaborou ao longo de sessenta anos, até o ano de sua morte.
Foi casado com Mariá Freitas David, com quem teve oito filhos.


== Homenagens e reconhecimento ==
Em novembro de 2015, por iniciativa da Academia de Letras da Bahia (ALB), foi realizado um seminário chamado ""Relendo Thales de Azevedo"", tendo por organizadora a Universidade Federal da Bahia e ainda a própria ALB, a Associação Brasileira de Antropologia, o Museu de Arte da Bahia e a Secretaria de Cultura do Estado da Bahia.

1690,"""Mulher, Mulher, Mulher (Ideia Fixa)"", conhecida por vezes como ""Mulher, Mulher, Mulher"" ou simplesmente ""Mulher"", é um single lançado pelo sambista brasileiro Neguinho da Beija-Flor em 2010. Foi considerado o hit do carnaval do Rio de Janeiro, sendo executada à exaustão em vários blocos e shows de samba. A canção tem versões em funk carioca, original, e outra em samba, preferida por Neguinho para o airplay, embora a versão funk seja a mais tocada.
Ficou famosa por repetir em seus cerca de quatro minutos 190 vezes a palavra ""mulher"", até mesmo quando o termo deveria ser flexionado em número (plural) de acordo com a concordância nominal da língua portuguesa.


== História ==
A canção foi composta por Neguinho e Murilo Rayol em 1974 como uma brincadeira, mas só foi retirada da gaveta em 2009.[carece de fontes?] Naquela época, os dois amigos estavam indo a um baile do Cordão do Bola Preta, um tradicional bloco carnavalesco do Rio de Janeiro, e perceberam que havia muito mais mulheres que homens na quadra, segundo suas estimativas, na proporção 10/1. Desta maneira surgiu a canção, usada para brincar com aqueles que não gostavam dela, como se não quisessem ouvir a palavra ""mulher"" por serem supostamente homossexuais.
A canção não era do gosto da esposa de Neguinho, que a apelidou de ""Melô do Tarado"". Na época de seu lançamento oficial, foi apelidada, pejorativamente, de ""Melô das Lésbicas"", conforme conta o colunista Ancelmo Góis.
""Mulher, Mulher, Mulher (Ideia Fixa)"" é a segunda canção lançada por Neguinho desde sua recuperação do câncer, só depois do samba-enredo da escola de samba da qual é puxador, a GRES Beija-Flor de Nilópolis.


== Versões Oficiais ==
Em 2009, Neguinho recebeu um convite de Rômulo Costa, líder da equipe de som Furacão 2000 para gravar uma canção que entraria no DVD Tsunami IV, a ser lançado naquele ano. Neguinho aceitou o convite e gravou ""Mulher, Mulher, Mulher (Ideia Fixa)"", engavetada há 35 anos. Devido à repercussão da canção, Neguinho decidiu regravá-la em versão samba, disponibilizando-a gratuitamente em seu site para download digital. Atendendo a protestos feministas, porém, Neguinho regravou a canção mais uma vez, numa versão ""limpa"", que será a lançada em seu álbum planejado para ser lançado em março de 2010.
Versão funk carioca – 4:03
Versão samba original – 4:03
Versão samba ""limpa"" (versão do álbum) – 4:08


== Videoclipe ==
A canção tem dois videoclipes. Num deles, ele canta com a esposa, filha e a imagem da mãe falecida. No outro, vê-se uma versão ao vivo cantada somente por Neguinho no palco da equipe Furacão 2000. Esta versão é a contida no DVD Tsunami IV e é a mais divulgada.


== Crítica e Polêmica ==
Logo após seu lançamento, a canção sofreu com críticas e polêmicas. Críticos ignoraram-na, por ter letra pobre. Feministas protestaram contra a letra, dizendo ser machista e só depreciar as mulheres. Neguinho explica como aconteceu:

1692,"O Largo São Bento é considerado um dos espaços públicos mais antigos de São Paulo. O logradouro foi oficializado através do ATO nº 972, de 24 de agosto de 1916. Sua ocupação ocorreu logo após a fundação de São Paulo em 1554. O espaço abriga a Basílica Abacial de Nossa Senhora da Assunção, o Colégio de São Bento e a Faculdade de São Bento, locais que, em conjunto, designam o Mosteiro de São Bento, um dos pontos turísticos de São Paulo.


== História ==
No Largo São Bento, estava instalada a taba do Cacique Tibiriçá, pai da índia Bartira que se casou com o pioneiro João Ramalho. A aldeia permaneceu nesse local até o ano do falecimento do Cacique, em 1562. Tibiriçá foi importante na história paulistana, ajudando, junto com outros índios, a defender a futura São Paulo do ataque de tribos inimigas. O Largo era um local estratégico para a defesa da cidade, pois estava localizado no topo de uma colina. Isso proporcionava uma visão ampla da área ao redor da Vila.

Em 1598, o beneditino Frei Mauro Teixeira escolheu o Largo São Bento para a fundação de uma pequena capela sob a invocação de São Bento. A construção ficaria entre os rios Anhangabaú e Tamanduateí, abrangendo de um lado o Vale do Anhangabaú e, do outro, até a atual rua 25 de Março. Por volta de 1600 vieram para São Paulo outros três beneditinos: frei Mateus de Ascensão, frei Antonio de Assunção e frei Bento da Purificação. Eles transformam a igreja em um mosteiro.
Cinquenta anos depois, Fernão Dias Pais, conhecido como “o caçador de esmeraldas” doou uma grande quantia de dinheiro para que se edificasse uma nova igreja. Como agradecimento, seus restos mortais, assim como os de sua mulher Maria Garcia, foram guardados no mosteiro. Junto ao altar de Fernão Dias e sua mulher, uma placa no chão, além da data de nascimento e morte, diz o seguinte: “Grandes benfeitores desta abadia / Para este jazigo lhes trasladou os restos mortais / A gratidão beneditina” . Fernão Dias, no entanto, costeou a antiga igreja e mosteiro de São Bento que foram demolidos nos primeiros anos do século XX.
Em 1854, o largo passou por uma reurbanização seguindo modelos europeus da época. O motivo foi o intenso movimento graças a dois grandes hotéis instalados em suas redondezas. Os costumes continuaram mudando e com a ideia de banho sendo veiculada à saúde, em 23 de dezembro de 1866, foi inaugurada a mais antiga casa de banho, Seria Paulista, no largo São Bento, nº 01, com oito banheiras em mármores, torneiras e encanamentos de chumbo.
D. Miguel Kruse, em julho de 1900, assume a direção do Mosteiro. Na tentativa de criar um bom colégio secundário, surge, em 1903, o Colégio de São Bento, que ainda permanece sob a administração da Ordem. Em 1908, é fundada a Faculdade de Filosofia, que seria a primeira do Brasil e que, atualmente, encontra-se ligada à PUC de São Paulo. Em 1911, é instalada a primeira abadia de monjas beneditinas da América do Sul, o Mosteiro de Santa Maria.

Também em 1900, a primeira linha de elétricos da cidade partiu do Largo São Bento e 10 anos depois iniciou-se a construção do novo mosteiro, segundo o projeto do arquiteto Richard Berndl, da cidade de Munique, Alemanha. As obras foram finalizadas em 1921 e, no ano seguinte, deu-se a cerimônia de sua sagração, dando origem ao conjunto beneditino que se conhece.
A última grande transformação veio com o metrô, durante a década de 1970. O largo ganhou bancos, calçadão, jardins e um movimento mais intenso. Em comemoração aos 400 anos do Mosteiro de São Bento, em 1998, a iluminação e a fachada do prédio foram recuperadas, o Largo São Bento reconfigurado e restauraram o grande órgão Walcker, instrumento com mais de seis mil tubos, inaugurado em 1954.


== Vida cultural ==
Todos os domingos, às 10 horas, acontece no Mosteiro de São Bento uma missa acompanhada por um coral que entoa belos cantos gregorianos. Além da religião, a tradição gastronômica está presente no Largo São Bento. A padaria do mosteiro oferece famosas preparações, como o Bolo dos Monges, Bolo Santa Escolástica, o Pão de São Bento e Pão de Mel Benedictus. Na região próxima ao largo, também é possível encontrar bares e restaurantes tradicionais de São Paulo, como a Casa Mathilde e o Café Girondino.

Outra atração é a biblioteca no Mosteiro de São Bento, com mais de cem mil títulos, muitos deles raros e que vieram ao Brasil junto com os monges beneditinos em 1598. É possível encontrar desde a bíblia de Gutenberg do século 15 até livros como ""O Código Da Vinci"", de Dan Brown e atuais que atendem à demanda dos alunos dos cursos de Filosofia e Teologia oferecidos pela Faculdade de São Bento. Os alunos têm à disposição uma antessala com mesas e computadores, onde podem consultar as obras, porém o acesso ao ambiente onde se armazenam os livros é restrito aos monges beneditinos que lá vivem. Os interessados de fora podem solicitar uma permissão de visita.
O Largo também abriga eventos periódicos como a Feira São Bento do Livro, organizada pela biblioteca, exposições, como a O Pequeno Príncipe Descobre o Mosteiro, que aconteceu em agosto de 2016, e o Festival Internacional São Bento de Órgão, que ocorre anualmente na Basílica, desde 1994. Estabelecimentos bancários e lojas do terceiro setor na Estação São Bento oferecem praticidade a quem passa pelo largo. Banheiros públicos, uma mesa de tênis e uma escultura do artista Caciporé Torres terminam de compor este espaço público.

1694,"Em matemática, uma invariante modular de um grupo é um invariante de um grupo finito agindo em um espaço vetorial de característica positiva (geralmente dividindo a ordem do grupo). O estudo de invariantes modulares foi originado por volta de 1914 por Dickson (2004).

Em seguida, sob a ação do um elemento g de GLn(Fq) estes determinantes são todos multiplicados por det(g), por isso são todos os invariantes de SLn(Fp) e as razões [e1, ...,en]/[0,1,...,n−1] são invariantes de GLn(Fq), chamadas invariantes Dickson. Dickson provou que o anel completo de invariantes Fq[X1, ...,Xn]GLn(Fq) é uma álgebra polinomial sobre os n Dickson invariantes [0,1,...,i−1,i+1,...,n]/[0,1,...,n−1] for i=0, 1, ..., n−1. Steinberg (1987) deu uma prova curta do teorema de Dickson.
As matrizes [e1, ...,en] são divisíveis por todas as formas lineares não-zero nas variáveis Xi com coeficientes no campo finito Fq. Em particular, o determinante de Moore [0,1,...,n−1] é um produto de tais formas lineares, tomado ao longo de 1+q+q2+...+qn–1 representantes de n-1 espaço projetivo dimensional sobre o campo. Esta fatorização é similar à fatoração de determinante de Vandermonde em fatores lineares

1700,"Jacques Emile Paul Pilon, (Le Havre, 1905 — São Paulo, 1962) foi um arquiteto francês com importante atuação na arquitetura brasileira, notadamente a paulista, entre as décadas de 1930 e 1960.


== Biografia ==
Aos cinco anos, Pilon imigrou com sua família para o Rio de Janeiro, local onde seu pai trabalharia em atividades portuárias. Voltou para a França para estudar e, após graduar-se pela École Nationale de Beaux Arts em 1932, retornou ao Brasil, onde viveria até o fim de sua vida.


== Carreira ==
Jacques Pilon, contemporâneo de nomes como Gregori Warchavchik e Rino Levi, foi um dos responsáveis pela propagação dos princípios do modernismo na arquitetura brasileira. Sua obra, no entanto, foi influenciada no início pelo ecletismo e pela art déco.
Pilon foi sócio do engenheiro Francisco Matarazzo Netto, que conhecera em 1933 em uma visita à obra do edifício Sulacap, projeto do escritório de Robert Prentice, onde Pilon trabalhava na ocasião. Em 1934, nascia a Pilmat Pilon-Matarazzo Ltda, que foi responsável pelos projetos e construção de diversos edifícios em São Paulo, até 1939, quando a sociedade foi dissolvida. Junto com Matarazzo Neto, Pilon participou, em 1934, do concurso do projeto do viaduto do Chá, ficando em terceiro lugar e, em 1939, venceram o concurso do projeto do Viaduto General Olímpio da Silveira. Com o arquiteto Rubens Borba, projetou a atual Biblioteca Mário de Andrade.


== Arquitetura moderna ==
Apesar de sua proximidade com os padrões clássicos e acadêmicos de outrora, que seguiam os estilos eclético e art-déco, Pilon introduz a modernidade em suas obras, removendo adornos e adotando formas mais geométricas em suas fachadas, influenciado pelos ares modernos que despontavam no Brasil e já expressos no projeto do MEC, cuja construção teve início em 1935. O Condomínio Edifício Paissandu, inaugurado em 1938, é um dos exemplares desta transição, onde a geometria e a quase ausência de ornamentos de fachada aponta para o modernismo. Esses traços modernistas foram incentivados pela crescente e acelerada urbanização da cidade de São Paulo, especialmente na região central, e ainda pela economia construtiva de fachadas menos ornamentadas.
Em 1935, pela Pilmat Pilon-Matarazzo, Pilon projeta e constrói o Edifício Santo André, o segundo a ser construído em Higienópolis, encomendado pelo pai de seu sócio, o conde Andrea Matarazzo filho do industrial Francisco Matarazzo. Localizado na esquina das ruas Piauí com Avenida Angélica, com vista para o Parque Buenos Aires,com painel,no hall de entrada, em alto relevo, do artista John Graz, foi considerado o edifício elegante da ocasião, onde residiu a artista modernista Tarsila do Amaral. O Santo André foi ainda o primeiro edifício a usar estacas tipo Franki em sua fundação. 
No ano de 1944 projeta o Edifício São Luiz, na Praça da República, em São Paulo, no estilo neoclássico francês, com abrigo anti-aéreo, utilizado posteriormente como garagem por seus moradores.
A partir de 1945, com a influência de novos colaboradores, a obra de Pilon foi gradualmente incorporando cada vez mais os componentes característicos da arquitetura moderna. Deste período destacam-se o edifício da embaixada francesa, de 1951; o Edifício Paulicéia, projetado juntamente com Gian Carlo Gasperini; e o Liceu Pasteur.
Um dos últimos projetos desenvolvidos por Pilon e Gasperini foi o complexo industrial da Mecânica Pesada em Taubaté, um projeto urbanístico e arquitetônico composto de instalações industriais e vila de operários.

1703,"A Ermida de São José é uma ermida portuguesa localizada na localidade de Toledo, concelho de Velas, na ilha açoriana de São Jorge.
A fundação desta ermida deve-se ao rico proprietário da ilha de São Jorge, Dr. José Pereira da Cunha da Silveira e Sousa. A ideia de uma tal edificação foi-lhe sugerida em 1862 em virtude do lugar do Toledo, nome que certamente provem do por ali ter vivido algum espanhol da localidade espanhola do mesmo nome, ser muito distante da igreja paroquial e também do cemitério, localizados na freguesia de Santo Amaro, local ao qual este curato pretense.
Comprado o terreno em local propício à construção do templo, foi a primeira pedra lançada festivamente no dia 13 de Junho de 1876.
A obra, sub a responsabilidade dos mestres canteiros Miguel, responsável pelo corpo da igreja e o filho deste, Raul, responsável pela torre sineira, ambos originários da ilha do Pico, durou relativamente pouco, mas a ermida invocada a São José, patrono do seu amor, esteve durante alguns anos, sem que nela se celebrasse missa, pois que a primeira missa dita no seu altar decorreu no dia 16 de Maio de 1889.
Nesse dia, o referido Dr. Cunha da Silveira procedeu à inauguração, de uma lápide que, colocada abaixo da sineira, da torre, contém a seguinte instrução:

""1889. Esta capela, com. a invocação de São José, foi mandada fazer por José Pereira da Cunha da Silveira e Sousa, em propriedade sua, e à sua custa para seu uso e dos seus sucessores que conservarão; a posse e a administração com todos os seus pertences, paramentos e alfaias 16 de Maio"".

Por diligência do Dr. José Pereira da Cunha da Silveira e Sousa, foi por decreto de 31 de Outubro de 1859, publicado no Diário do Governo de 2 de Novembro permitida a constituição dum curato no Toledo, com sede na capela de São José tendo o cura uma côngrua para seu sustento.

1708,"Fernando de Talavera (1428 - 1507) foi um monge jerónimo, prior de Prado, bispo de Ávila e arcebispo de Granada, confessor e conselheiro de Isabel, a Católica, que agiu activamente na política castelhana e na organização do reino de Granada. Foi ainda um escritor, embora menos conhecido, com indubitáveis méritos.
Nasceu de família conversa, como se especificou nas denúncias à Inquisição quando era já o primeiro Arcebispo de Granada, cerca de 1500, em Oropesa (província de Toledo), provavelmente filho de García Álvarez de Toledo, Senhor de Oropesa e de Ayala (falecido depois de 1429), da família de um Mestre da Ordem de Santiago e da bastarda de bastardos afonsinos Leonor Téllez Alfonso de Castilla-Guzmán e de Haro (nascida antes de 1370), pais de um tal Fernando Alvarez de Toledo y Tellez Alfonso de Guzmán, (nascido cerca de 1390 que também poderia ter sido o seu pai biológico) homónimo mais antigo de Fernando Alvarez de Toledo de outra família (os ""Alba"", ligados com o Arcebispo Gutierre Álvarez de Toledo, mas não com estes últimos) que foi promovido a Conde de Oropesa por Isabel I de Castela em 1475 com quem se confunde frequentemente por homonímia.
Por isso os primeiros cronistas chamaram-no ""Frei Hernando de Oropesa"". Estudou teologia na Universidade de Salamanca e fez estudos de secretariado em Barcelona. Tinha 30 anos de idade quando ingressou na ordem de São Jerónimo e pouco depois era Prior do Mosteiro do Prado, perto de Valladolid.
Foi confessor da rainha Isabel I de Castela, ainda antes de esta chegar ao trono (1474). De facto, foi o encarregado de supervisionar que os votos de Joana, a Beltraneja, herdeira de Henrique IV de Castela, fossem feitos correctamente, para que não pudessem ser revogados, reavivando a guerra civil que levou Isabel ao trono. Em 1480 actua como árbitro na redução das rendas da nobreza, e consegue fundos para a Guerra de Granada.
Opôs-se à criação da Inquisição, pelo que foi pregar para Sevilha com a ideia de evitar medidas mais duras contra um povo que se tinha convertido ao cristianismo, mas que conhecia pouco e mal essa religião. Depois da chegada dos inquisidores, chega a denunciar os abusos destes.
Até 1486 é ele o bispo de Ávila, administrador apostólico da diocese de Salamanca (1483-1485), e em 1492 primeiro arcebispo de Granada. Ali procede a aplicação de uma política de conversão suave, evitando ameaças e coerções. De facto, impediu que a Inquisição se estabelecesse em Granada. Esta política de mão branda teve um êxito bastante limitado, ganhando inimigos. Em 1499 o Cardeal Cisneros passa a empregar métodos mais enérgicos, forçando as conversões, o que levaria à rebelião dos muçulmanos e mouriscos.
Em 1505, um ano depois da morte da rainha Isabel, o Inquisidor de Córdova, Lucero, manda prender amigos e familiares de frei Fernando, e prepara-lhes um processo. Mas Roma, em concreto o Papa Júlio II (um Médici), defende-o e Cisneros põe em liberdade os seus parentes em 1507. Nesse mesmo ano morre frei Fernando de Talavera.
Parece ter sido um homem rigoroso e austero, interessado na verdadeira espiritualidade. O seu carácter austero levou-o, por exemplo, a criticar a rainha pelos adornos, bailes e corridas de touros celebradas em honra de uma delegação francesa em 1493.
As suas obras reflectem o interesse por ensinar a doutrina cristã de forma prática, como o Tratado sobre o vestir, calçar e comer, um tratado sobre as práticas da época que a seu ver eram pecaminosas. Outras obras suas são:
De como hão de viver as monjas de San Bernardo no seu mosteiro de Ávila
Muito proveitoso tratado contra o murmurar e dizer mal de outro na sua ausência…
Proveitoso tratado de como devemos haver cuidado de despender muito bem o tempo, e em que maneira o havemos de despender para que não se perca algum momento",pt,Fernando de Talavera,https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_de_Talavera
1709,"Edivaldo Oliveira Chaves, mais conhecido como Pita (Nilópolis, 4 de agosto de 1958), é um ex-futebolista brasileiro.


== Carreira ==
Pita morava em Cubatão, no bairro do Casqueiro, e começou sua vida vendendo siris para quem ia da capital para o litoral e vice-versa no acostamento da Via Anchieta. Aos treze, Pita foi convidado a disputar um campeonato de futebol na praia e se destacou.
Logo após este campeonato ele começou a treinar na Portuguesa Santista e, depois de dois anos, já estava no juvenil do Santos. Em 1978 o treinador Formiga promoveu-o definitivamente para a equipe principal que estava cheia de jovens talentos, como Juary, João Paulo e Nílton Batata. Esta equipe foi apelidada de ""Meninos da Vila"". Neste mesmo ano começaram o Campeonato Paulista desacreditados e terminaram campeões. Foi o único título de Pita defendendo o Santos.
Em junho de 1984, Pita foi negociado com o São Paulo, numa troca que envolveu a ida de Zé Sergio e Humberto para a Vila Belmiro. No time do Morumbi, conquistou o Campeonato Paulista de 1985 e o segundo título nacional do tricolor. Apesar do campeonato, Pita discutiu com o técnico Cilinho e quase deixou o clube, permanecendo por interferência da diretoria. Em 1987, conseguiria novamente o Campeonato Paulista, sendo festejado e reconhecido como craque também pela torcida tricolor.
Mas o período de glórias no São Paulo não foi tão longo assim: durou apenas quatro anos, e, em 1988, Pita foi vendido ao Racing Strasbourg, por um milhão de dólares. Depois de rápida passagem pelo clube francês, Pita voltou ao Brasil para defender o Guarani e depois participou da temporada inicial da implantação do futebol no Japão em 1993.

1718,"Sanclerlândia é um município brasileiro do estado de Goiás. Sua população segundo o censo de 2010, é de aproximadamente 7.783 habitantes em 2015.


== História ==
Sanclerlândia nasceu de um povoado chamado Cruzeiro, formado em 1943, em um local onde os fiéis se encontravam para rezar o terço. O primeiro morador desse povoado, Saint Clair Rodrigues de Mendonça (comerciante), morreu em 1958. Em homenagem a ele, o povoado passou a se chamar Sanclerlândia, que, em 5 de janeiro de 1964, emancipou-se de Mossâmedes. As pessoas naturais de Sanclerlândia são chamadas de Sanclerlandenses. Segundo um de seus descendentes, Olivio Mendonça, o nome Sanclerlândia se deve ao fato de seu fundador se chamar Saint Clair, nome de origem francesa. Como o pessoal local tinha dificuldade em pronunciar ""Saint Clair"", o mesmo foi apelidado de Sancler. Hoje existe até um supermercado em sua homenagem, chamado ""Super Sancler"". Sancle foi o primeiro comerciante local. No local onde os habitantes se encontravam para rezar, foi colocado uma cruz, quando então o povoado, passou a ser chamado de ""Povoado do Cruzeiro"". Hoje no mesmo local está situada a praça Hermógenes Coelho. Com o tempo e a tradição da festa de São Sebastião, o povoado aumentou de tamanho, foi ganhando personalidades políticas, como o Sr Onésimo de Jesus Vieira, Olívio Rodrigues de Mendonça, o próprio Sancler, entre outros; o povoado foi ganhando expressão política e em 1964 foi emancipado. O município é constituído também pelo distrito de Aparecida /Fartura.

1720,"Uma estrela múltipla é um sistema constituído por três ou mais estrelas que, vistas da Terra, parecem estar muito próximas entre si. Essa proximidade pode ser devida ao fato de estarem gravitacionalmente ligadas ou então pode ser apenas aparente, como resultado da projeção dessas estrelas na esfera celeste.
A maioria das estrelas múltiplas são constituídas por três objetos e denominadas estrelas triplas. Sistemas com quatro ou mais componentes são menos frequentes.
Os sistemas estelares múltiplos têm usualmente dimensões maiores do que as estrelas binárias e menores do que aglomerados estelares abertos, que têm tipicamente entre cem e mil objetos.


== Exemplos de estrelas múltiplas ==
Algol, localizada em Perseus, é o sistema ternário mais conhecido, que se acreditou por muito tempo ser uma binária. Duas das estrelas componentes se eclipsam entre si, resultando na variação de brilho com o tempo, registrada pela primeira vez em 1670 por Geminiano Montanari. O nome Algol provém do árabe الغول(al-ghūl), que significa ""estrela do demônio"", devido provavelmente ao seu comportamento peculiar.[carece de fontes?]
Alpha Centauri, na constelação meridional de Centaurus, é também uma estrela ternária, contendo a quarta estrela mais brilhante no céu noturno, com uma magnitude aparente de -0,01. Este sistema também sublinha o fato de que estrelas binárias não devem ser negligenciadas na busca por planetas habitáveis. A distância mais próxima entre Alpha Centauri A e B é de 11 UA e ambas as estrelas devem possuir zonas estáveis habitáveis.
Há também exemplos de sistemas com mais de três estrelas. Castor é um sistema sêxtuplo de estrelas, sendo a segunda estrela mais brilhante na constelação de Gemini e uma das estrelas mais brilhantes no céu noturno. Astrônomos identificaram Castor como uma binária em 1719. Cada uma das componentes é em si uma binária espectroscópica. Castor também possui uma companheira muito menos brilhante e bem mais distante, que também é uma binária espectroscópica. A binária visual Alcor-Mizar em Ursa Major também consiste de seis estrelas, quatro compreendendo Mizar e duas Alcor.[carece de fontes?]

1722,"Honi soit qui mal y pense é uma expressão francesa que significa Envergonhe-se quem nisto vê malícia, muito usada em meios cultos. Também é o lema da Ordem da Jarreteira, comenda britânica criada pelo rei Eduardo III de Inglaterra, no tempo das Cruzadas. E um dos lemas do Reino Unido, estando estampado em sua bandeira.
Diz a lenda que, em 1347, durante um baile, a Condessa de Salisbury, amante do mesmo Eduardo III, perdeu a sua liga, azul. O Rei mais que depressa recolocou-a, sob o olhar e sorrisos (cúmplice) dos nobres.
O Rei grita então (em francês, que era a língua oficial da corte inglesa) ""Messieurs, honni soit qui mal y pense! Ceux qui rient en ce moment seront un jour très honorés d'en porter une semblable, car ce ruban sera mis en tel honneur que les railleurs eux-mêmes le rechercheront avec empressement."" (Maldito seja quem pense mal disto! Os que riem nesta hora ficarão um dia honradíssimos por usar uma igual, porque esta liga será posta em tal destaque que mesmo os trocistas a procurarão com avidez).
No dia seguinte cria a ordem da Jarreteira, tendo como símbolo uma liga azul sobre fundo dourado, que ainda hoje é a mais prestigiosa ordem do Reino Unido, tendo somente 25 membros e cujo Grão Mestre é o monarca da Inglaterra.

1724,"Luta de classes, refere-se a um fenômeno social de tensão ou antagonismo que existe entre pessoas de diferentes classes sociais devido aos competitivos interesses socioeconômicos e desejos dessas pessoas diante da lógica do modo de produção capitalista, dando forma a um conflito que se expressa nos campos econômico, ideológico e político. A visão de que a luta de classes fornece a alavanca para mudanças sociais radicais para a maioria, é fundamental nos trabalhos de Karl Marx e do anarquista Mikhail Bakunin.
O conflito de classes pode assumir muitas formas diferentes: violência direta, como guerras travadas por recursos e mão de obra barata; violência indireta, como mortes por pobreza, fome, doença ou condições de trabalho inseguras; coerção, como a ameaça de perda de empregos ou suspensão de investimentos importantes; ou ideologicamente, como livros e artigos. Além disso, existem formas políticas de conflito de classe; legalmente ou ilegalmente pressionando ou subornando líderes governamentais para a aprovação de legislação partidária desejável, incluindo leis trabalhistas, códigos fiscais, leis do consumidor, atos de congressos ou outras sanções, injunções ou tarifas. O conflito pode ser direto, como com um locaute destinado a destruir um sindicato, ou indireto, como com uma desaceleração informal na produção como forma de protesto contra os baixos salários dos trabalhadores ou uso práticas trabalhistas injustas pelo capital.


== Origens ==

Segundo pensadores como David Ricardo, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Karl Marx e Mikhail Bakunin, a luta de classes seria a força motriz por trás das grandes revoluções na história, fornecendo a alavanca para radicais mudanças sociais. Esse conflito teria começado com a criação da propriedade privada dos meios de produção. A partir daí, a sociedade passou a ser dividida entre proprietários (burguesia) e trabalhadores (proletariado), ou seja, possuidores dos meios de produção e possuidores unicamente de sua força de trabalho. Na sociedade capitalista, a burguesia retêm a mercadoria produzida pelo proletariado, e o produtor dessa mercadoria recebe um salário que é pago de acordo com a qualificação profissional dele.

Outra característica importante do capitalismo é o conceito criado por Karl Marx da mais-valia. A mais-valia consiste basicamente dessa porcentagem a mais que os capitalistas retiram da classe do proletariado. O acréscimo dessa porcentagem pode ser atingida, por exemplo, aumentando o tempo de trabalho dos operários e mantendo o salário. A luta de classes, segundo Karl Marx, só acabará com o fim do capitalismo e com o fim das classes sociais. O socialismo, que seria como uma fase de transição do capitalismo para o comunismo, foi implementado em diversos países no século XX, a maioria porém reverteu novamente para o capitalismo ou para um sistema econômico misto. A proposta mais radical é abolição do Estado e sua reorganização descentralizada em moldes federativos anarquistas. Embora essa última seja criticada por criar ""microestados"" sem um poder central colocando o fim do poder estatal como uma utopia.[carece de fontes?]
Apesar de uma parte da história da humanidade, segundo Karl Marx, ter sido a história da luta de classes, a sociedade original, segundo ele, não possuía divisões sociais. Ainda segundo Marx, as primeiras sociedades indígenas das Américas não possuíam estratificação social, sendo o cacique e o pajé apenas figuras simbólicas. Isso se deveria ao fato de que, nesse estágio das forças produtivas sociais, não havia praticamente excedente. Todos os membros da sociedade eram por isso obrigados a participar do processo produtivo, de modo que era impossível a formação de uma hierarquia que diferenciasse as pessoas dessa sociedade. Uma das primeiras formas de hierarquização dos membros foi a divisão homem/mulher, quando os homens começaram a explorar as mulheres. A luta de classes origina-se, então, no momento em que a sociedade passa a ser composta de diferentes castas.
Essa divisão dos membros em classes foi possibilitada quando as forças produtivas atingiram um certo nível de produtividade, onde o excedente já promovia maior segurança à sociedade em relação às suas necessidades. Mas, apesar de garantir uma proteção em tempos escassos, por exemplo, o excedente abriu a possibilidade do jogo político. O controle sobre o excedente se desenvolve em conjunto com a formação de uma minoria que ganha assim poder sobre todos outros membros da sociedade. Dessa maneira origina-se uma diferenciação quanto à tarefa social de cada membro. Entre as diversas classes que podem se formar, estão sempre presente as classes dos senhores (não-trabalhadores) e a classe trabalhadora.
Com o desenvolvimento das forças produtivas, a classe dominante (diferente para cada período histórico) é posta em questão. As classes de baixo reconhecem que a regência da classe exploradora torna-se desnecessária para a continuação do desenvolvimento técnico, enquanto esta tenta, por meios oficiais, manter seu poder. Nessas épocas de desacordo entre as relações sociais de produção vigentes e o patamar técnico dos meios de produção, a probabilidade de uma revolução tende a ser maior. A antiga classe exploradora é, assim, deposta, e uma nova entra em seu lugar. Dessa maneira, a história da sociedade humana é a história de classes dominantes, uma após a outra.


== Uso ==

No passado, o termo ""luta de classes"" era usado principalmente por socialistas, que definem uma classe por sua relação com os meios de produção - como fábricas, terras e máquinas. Deste ponto de vista, o controle social da produção e do trabalho é uma competição entre as classes, e a divisão desses recursos envolve necessariamente conflitos e causa danos. Pode envolver confrontos em pequena escala, se intensificar em confrontos maciços e, em alguns casos, levar à derrota geral de uma das classes concorrentes. No entanto, em tempos mais contemporâneos, busca-se uma nova definição entre as sociedades capitalistas nos Estados Unidos e outros países ocidentalizados.
O anarquista Mikhail Bakunin argumentou que a luta de classes da classe trabalhadora, camponesa e pobre teve o potencial de levar a uma revolução social envolvendo a derrubada das elites governantes e a criação do socialismo libertário. Isso era apenas um potencial, e nem sempre a luta de classes era, argumentou ele, o fator único ou decisivo na sociedade, mas era central. Em contraste, os marxistas argumentam que o conflito de classes sempre desempenha o papel decisivo e fundamental na história dos sistemas hierárquicos baseados em classes, como o capitalismo e o feudalismo. Os marxistas referem-se a suas manifestações abertas como guerra de classes, uma luta cuja resolução em favor da classe trabalhadora é vista por eles como inevitável sob o capitalismo plutocrático.


=== Sociedades pré-capitalistas ===
Onde as sociedades são socialmente divididas com base em status, riqueza ou controle social da produção e distribuição, as estruturas das classes surgem e, portanto, são covalentes com a própria civilização. Está bem documentado desde pelo menos a Antiguidade Clássica europeia (Conflito das Ordens, Espártaco, etc.)  e as várias revoltas populares na Europa medieval tardia e em outros lugares.
Uma das primeiras análises desses conflitos encontra-se no livro A Guerra Camponesa Alemã de Friedrich Engels. Uma das primeiras análises do desenvolvimento de classes como fator de conflitos entre classes emergentes está disponível em Mutualismo: Um Fator de Evolução de Piotr Kropotkin. Neste trabalho, Kropotkin analisa a partilha de bens após a morte em sociedades pré-classe ou caçadora-coletora, e como a herança produziu as divisões e os conflitos iniciais de classe.


=== Século XXI nos Estados Unidos ===
O bilionário e amigo de Warren Buffett, George Soros aborda o uso pejorativo do termo pelo direito conservador afirmando: ""Falando como a pessoa que seria mais prejudicada por isso, acho que meus colegas gestores de fundos de cobertura convocam essa guerra de classe porque eles não gostariam de pagar mais impostos"".
Bill Moyers, por exemplo, pronunciou um discurso no Brennan Center for Justice em Dezembro de 2013, intitulado ""The Great American Class War"", referente à luta atual entre democracia e plutocracia nos EUA. Chris Hedges escreveu uma coluna para o site Truthdig chamada ""vamos ganhar esta guerra de classes que começou"", citando o single da cantora Pink, ""Get the Party Started"". 
O historiador Steve Fraser, autor de The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power, afirma que o conflito de classes é inevitável se as condições políticas e econômicas atuais continuarem, observando que ""as pessoas estão cada vez mais cansadas... suas vozes não são ouvidas. E acho que isso só pode durar tanto tempo sem que existam mais e mais surtos do que costumava chamar de luta de classes, guerra de classes.""


== Sociedades capitalistas ==
O exemplo típico de luta de classes descrito é o conflito dentro do capitalismo. Este conflito de classe é visto principalmente entre a burguesia e o proletariado, e assume a forma de desentendimento sobre horas de trabalho, valor dos salários, divisão dos lucros, custo dos bens de consumo, cultura no trabalho, controle do parlamento ou burocracia e desigualdade econômica. A implementação de programas governamentais que podem parecer puramente humanitários, como a prevenção de acidentes de trabalho, pode realmente ser uma forma de conflito de classe. No conflito de classes dos EUA, muitas vezes é observado em conflitos capital-trabalho. Já em 1933, o representante Edward Hamilton da ALPA, (Air Line Pilots Association, International), usou o termo ""guerra de classes"" para descrever a oposição da administração aérea nas audiências do National Labor Board (Conselho Nacional do Trabalho) em Outubro daquele ano. Além dessas formas cotidianas de conflito de classe, durante períodos de crise, o conflito de classe revolucionário assume uma natureza violenta e envolve repressão, assalto, restrição de liberdades civis e violência assassina, como assassinatos ou esquadrões da morte.


=== Thomas Jefferson, Estados Unidos ===
Embora Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) tenha presidido os Estados Unidos de 1801 a 1809 e, seja considerado um dos Pais Fundadores, ele morreu com grndes dívidas. Quanto à interação entre as classes sociais, ele escreveu:


=== Warren Buffett, Estados Unidos ===
O investidor, bilionário e filantropo Warren Buffett, uma das 10 pessoas mais ricas do mundo, expressou em 2005, e novamente em 2006, sua visão de que sua classe (a ""classe rica"") está travando uma guerra de classes contra o restante da sociedade. Em 2005, Buffet disse à CNN: ""É uma guerra de classes, minha classe está ganhando, mas ela não deveria estar."" Numa entrevista concedida em Novembro de 2006 ao The New York Times, Buffett afirmou que ""[aqui] é a guerra de classes, tudo certo, mas é a minha classe, a classe rica, que está fazendo esta guerra e estamos ganhando."" Mais tarde, Warren doou de metade de sua fortuna a causas de caridade através de um programa desenvolvido por ele e o [[magnata] dos softwares Bill Gates. Em 2011, Buffett rogou aos legisladores que ""...parasem de mimar os super ricos.""


=== Noam Chomsky ===

Noam Chomsky, linguista, filósofo e ativista político americano criticou a luta de classes nos Estados Unidos:


=== Max Weber, Alemanha ===
Max Weber (1864-1920) concorda com as ideias fundamentais de Karl Marx sobre a economia provocar conflitos de classe, mas afirma que o conflito de classe também pode resultar de prestígio e poder. Weber argumenta que as classes provêm dos diferentes locais de propriedade. Diferentes locais podem afetar em grande parte a classe de alguém por sua educação, e as pessoas associadas. Ele também afirma que o prestígio resulta em diferentes agrupamentos de status. Esse prestígio é baseado no status social de seus pais. Prestígio é um valor atribuído que, muitas vezes, não pode ser alterado. Weber afirma que as diferenças de poder levaram à criação dos partidos políticos. Weber discorda de Marx sobre a formação das classes. Enquanto Marx acredita que os grupos são semelhantes devido ao seu status econômico, Weber argumenta que as classes são em grande parte formadas pelo status social. Weber não acredita que as comunidades são formadas por uma posição econômica, mas por um prestígio social semelhante. Weber reconhece que há uma relação entre status social, prestígio social e classes.


=== Primavera árabe ===
Numerosos fatores culminaram com o que se conhece como a Primavera Árabe. A agenda por trás do conflito civil e a derrubada final dos governos autoritários em todo o Oriente Médio incluíram questões como ditadura ou monarquia absoluta, violações dos direitos humanos, corrupção governamental (demonstrada pelos telegramas diplomáticos vazados pelo Wikileaks), declínio econômico, desemprego, extrema pobreza e uma série de fatores estruturais demográficos, como uma grande porcentagem de jovens educados mas insatisfeitos dentro da população. Além disso, alguns, como o filósofo esloveno Slavoj Žižek atribuem os protestos eleitorais no Irã em 2009 como uma das razões por trás da Primavera Árabe. Os indutores das revoltas nos países do norte da África e do Golfo Pérsico têm sido a concentração da riqueza nas mãos dos autocratas, no poder há décadas, transparência insuficiente de sua redistribuição, corrupção e, especialmente, a recusa dos jovens em aceitar o status quo.  Uma vez as ameaças à segurança alimentar afetaram todo o mundo, os preços aproximaram-se dos níveis da crise de alimentos de 2007-2008. A Anistia Internacional destacou o vazamento dos telegramas diplomáticos dos EUA, pelo Wikileaks, como o catalisador das revoltas.


== Socialismo ==


=== Perspectiva marxista ===

Karl Marx (1818-1883) foi um filósofo, nascido na Alemanha que viveu a maior parte de sua vida adulta em Londres, Inglaterra. No Manifesto Comunista, Marx argumentou que uma classe é formada quando seus membros conseguem a consciência de classe e a solidariedade. Isso ocorre amplamente quando os membros de uma classe se tornam conscientes de sua exploração e do conflito com outra classe. Uma classe então realizará seus interesses compartilhados numa identidade comum. De acordo com Marx, uma classe irá então agir contra aqueles que a estão explorando as classes mais baixas.
O que Marx ressalta é que os membros de cada uma das duas classes principais têm interesses em comum. Estas classes, ou interesses coletivos, estão em conflito com os da outra classe como um todo. Isso, por sua vez, leva a conflitos entre indivíduos de diferentes classes.
A análise marxista da sociedade identifica dois grupos sociais principais:
Trabalho: (o proletariado ou os trabalhadores) inclui qualquer pessoa que ganhe seu sustento vendendo sua força de trabalho e recebendo um salário pelo tempo de trabalho. Estes têm pouca escolha senão trabalhar para o capital, já que normalmente não têm possuem nenhuma forma de sobreviver independentemente.
Capital: (a burguesia ou os capitalistas) inclui qualquer pessoa que obtém sua renda não do trabalho, tanto quanto da mais-valia que eles apropriam dos trabalhadores que criam a riqueza. A renda dos capitalistas, portanto, é baseada em sua exploração dos trabalhadores (proletariado).
Nem todas as lutas de classe são violentas ou necessariamente radicais, como acontece com greves e locautes. O antagonismo de classe pode, em vez disso, ser expresso como a baixa moral dos trabalhadores, sabotagem e roubos menores, e abuso individual de trabalhadores por autoridades menores e acúmulo de informações. Também pode ser expresso em maior escala por apoio a partidos socialistas ou populistas. Do lado dos empregadores, o uso de empresas legais que reúnem sindicatos e o lobby para leis anti-sindicais são formas de luta de classes.
Nem toda a luta de classes é uma ameaça ao capitalismo, nem mesmo à autoridade de um capitalista individual. Uma luta estreita por salários mais altos por um pequeno setor da classe trabalhadora, o que muitas vezes se chama ""economismo"", dificilmente ameaça o status quo. De fato, ao aplicar as táticas artesanais para excluir trabalhadores qualificados, uma luta econômica pode até enfraquecer a classe trabalhadora como um todo dividindo-a. A luta de classes se torna mais importante no processo histórico à medida que se torna mais geral, à medida que as indústrias são modernas e não artesanais, à medida que a consciência de classe dos trabalhadores aumenta e se auto-organizam fora dos partidos políticos. Marx se referiu a isso como o progresso do proletariado de ser uma classe ""em si"", uma posição na estrutura social, ser um ""para si"", uma força ativa e consciente que poderia mudar o mundo.
Marx responsabiliza, em grande parte, a sociedade de capital industrial como a fonte da estratificação social, o que, em última instância, resulta em conflitos de classes. Ele afirma que o capitalismo cria uma divisão entre as classes que pode ser claramente observada nas fábricas de manufatura. O proletariado está separado da burguesia porque a produção se torna uma empresa social. A tecnologia presente nas fábricas contribui para esta divisão. A tecnologia aliena os trabalhadores, já que eles não são mais vistos como tendo uma habilidade especializada. Outro efeito da tecnologia é uma força de trabalho homogênea que pode ser facilmente substituível. Marx acreditava que este conflito de classe resultaria na queda da burguesia e que a propriedade privada converteria-se em propriedade comum. O modo de produção permaneceria, mas a propriedade comunitária eliminaria a luta de classes.
Mesmo depois de uma revolução, as duas classes se esforçariam, mas, eventualmente, a luta desapareceria e as classes se dissolveriam. À medida que os limites da classe se quebrassem, o aparelho estatal desapareceria. De acordo com Marx, a principal tarefa de qualquer aparelho estatal é defender o poder da classe dominante; mas sem qualquer classe, não haveria necessidade de um estado. Isso levaria à sociedade comunista sem classes e, sem estado.


=== União Soviética e sociedades similares ===
Uma variedade de pensadores predominantemente trotskistas e anarquistas argumentam que o conflito de classes existia em sociedades de estilo soviético. Seus argumentos descrevem como uma classe o estrato burocrático formado pelo partido político dominante (conhecido como Nomenklatura na União Soviética) - às vezes denominado uma ""nova classe""  - que controla e guia os meios de produção. Esta classe dominante é vista como sendo contrária ao restante da sociedade, geralmente considerado o proletariado. Este tipo de sistema é referido por eles como socialismo de estado, capitalismo de estado, coletivismo burocrático ou sociedades de ""novas classes"". (Cliff; Ðilas 1957) O marxismo era um poder ideológico tão predominante no que se tornou a União Soviética, uma vez que um grupo marxista conhecido como Partido Operário Social-Democrata Russo se formou no país, antes de 1917. Este partido logo se dividiu em duas facções principais; os bolcheviques, liderados por Vladimir Lenin, e os mencheviques, liderados por Julius Martov.
No entanto, muitos marxistas argumentam que, ao contrário do capitalismo, as elites soviéticas não possuíam os meios de produção, nem geravam mais-valias para a riqueza pessoal, como no capitalismo, já que o lucro gerado da economia era distribuído igualmente na sociedade soviética. Mesmo um trotskista como Ernest Mandel criticou o conceito de uma nova classe dominante como um oxímoro. Ele disse: ""A hipótese de que a burocracia seja uma nova classe dominante leva à conclusão de que, pela primeira vez na história, somos confrontados com uma ""classe dominante"" que não existe como uma classe antes de realmente governar.""


=== Perspectivas não marxistas ===
Comentaristas sociais, historiadores e teóricos socialistas comentaram sobre a luta de classes algum tempo antes de Marx, bem como a conexão entre a luta de classes, propriedade e lei: Augustin Thierry, François Guizot, François Mignet e Adolphe Thiers. Os fisiocratas, David Ricardo, e depois de Marx, Henry George notou o distribuição inelástica da terra e argumentou que isso criou certos privilégios (locação) para os proprietários de terras. De acordo com o historiador Arnold Toynbee, a estratificação ao longo das linhas da classe aparece apenas dentro das civilizações e, além disso, só aparece durante o processo de declínio da civilização enquanto não caracteriza a fase de crescimento de uma civilização.
Proudhon, em sua obra O Que É a Propriedade? (1840) afirma que ""certas classes não saboreiam a investigação sobre os títulos pretendidos para a propriedade e sua história fabulosa e talvez escandalosa."" Enquanto Proudhon viu que a solução surgiria quando as classes mais baixas criassem uma alternativa, a economia solidária, que centraria-se em cooperativas e locais de trabalho autogeridos, que concorreriam e lentamente, substituiriam a sociedade de classes capitalista, o anarquista Mikhail Bakunin, sob a influência de Proudhon, insistiu em que uma luta de classes maciça, da classe trabalhadora, camponesa e pobre, era essencial para a criação do socialismo libertário. Isso exigiria um confronto (final) sob a forma de uma revolução social.
Os fascistas muitas vezes se opuseram à luta de classes e, em vez disso, tentaram atrair a classe trabalhadora, prometendo preservar as classes sociais existentes e propuseram um conceito alternativo conhecido como colaboração de classes.


== Raça vs. classe ==

Em consonância com a sua perspectiva internacionalista, o marxismo ortodoxo e a maioria das tendências da esquerda, rejeita o racismo, o sexismo, etc., como lutas dentro da ordem capitalista que são distrações da luta de classes, o conflito real, que impede que os antagonistas alegados atuem em seu interesse de classe comum.
De acordo com Michel Foucault, no século XIX, a noção essencialista de ""raça"" foi incorporada por racistas, biólogos e eugenistas, que lhe deram o senso moderno de ""raça biológica"" que foi então integrada ao ""racismo estatal"". Por outro lado, Foucault afirma que, quando os marxistas desenvolveram o conceito de ""luta de classes"", eles foram parcialmente inspirados pelas noções antigas e não biológicas da ""raça"" e da ""luta racial"". Em uma carta a Friedrich Engels em 1882, Karl Marx escreveu: ""Você sabe muito bem onde encontramos a nossa ideia de luta de classes; descobrimos isso no trabalho dos historiadores franceses que falaram sobre a luta racial."" Para Foucault, o tema da guerra social fornece o princípio primordial que liga a luta de classes e raças.
Moses Hess, um importante teórico e trabalhista sionista do movimento socialista inicial, no epílogo do livro ""Roma e Jerusalém"" (1862) argumentou que ""a luta racial é primária, a luta de classes secundária... Com a cessação do antagonismo racial, a luta de classes também se paralisará. A igualdade de todas as classes da sociedade seguirá necessariamente a emancipação de todas as raças, pois ela se tornará uma questão científica da economia social.""
Nos tempos modernos, as escolas de pensamento emergentes nos EUA e noutros países sustentam o oposto como verdade. Argumenta-se que a luta racial é menos importante, porque a luta primária é a de classes, já que o trabalho de todas as raças humanas enfrenta os mesmos problemas e injustiças.

== Críticas ==

Essas críticas podem ser divididas em dois pontos de vista gerais: aqueles que questionam a própria existência das classes sociais como tais e, consequentemente, qualquer conflito central entre a sociedade e aqueles que rejeitam a função da luta de classes como um fator determinante (""motor"") da história.

Assim, por exemplo, Ludwig von Mises questiona o conceito de classes, pelo menos no sentido da linha que vai de Rosseau a Marx, como baseado ou definido por fatores econômicos, afirmando que o fator determinante na oposição percebida é o fator político-ideológico, que teria criado tal oposição.
Por outro lado, Karl Popper estima que conceitos como ""luta de classes"" têm uma função interpretativa da história (ver: Historiografia como meta-história em Historiografia). Como tal, eles são perfeitamente ""irrefutáveis"". Mas é fácil cair no erro ""historicista"" quando são usados como teorias ou fatores preditivos do desenvolvimento futuro de eventos. Em outras palavras, Popper faz a distinção entre os elementos que nos permitem - de forma mais ou menos semelhante à que as teorias cumprem na ciência - para interpretar os eventos de algum ponto de vista que nos interessa (sendo o método científico empregado na eliminação de falácias e preconceitos) e teorias científicas. Tais fatores interpretativos têm, em sua opinião, uma diferença essencial com as teorias da ciência: não são falseáveis ou refutáveis e, portanto, não se pode dizer que constitua uma explicação científica da história (no sentido de mostrar ou descobrir as leis naturais que determinam o funcionamento do desenvolvimento humano ou social), mas sim seriam um foco histórico ou narrativo de um determinado ponto de vista.


=== Críticas ideológicas ===
O conceito de luta de classes foi criticado no final do século XIX de vários ângulos teóricos, girando em torno da noção de luta.


==== Divisão da sociedade ====
O conceito de luta de classes foi criticado por dividir artificialmente a sociedade em dois campos hostis, além de defender o ódio e a violência de classe. Esta é a censura tradicionalmente abordada pela direita conservadora ou liberal. Os conservadores geralmente defendem o conceito de ""colaboração de classes"" que, de acordo com os defensores do conceito de luta de classes, é apenas ""a exploração de uma classe por outra"". Pitirim Sorokin discorda da teoria marxista, que responsabiliza a luta de classes como determinante dos rumos da história humana, afirmando que: ""a cooperação entre as classes sociais, é um fenômeno ainda mais universal do que o antagonismo entre elas.""

A Doutrina Social da Igreja também condena a luta de classes. Em sua famosa encíclica Rerum Novarum, o Papa Leão XIII reconheceu a existência de duas classes:
Mas ele recusa a ideia de ""luta"" entre as duas.
No entanto, as conciliações do conceito de luta de classes e ideais cristãos foram tentadas, particularmente através da teologia da libertação, desenvolvida nos anos 60 e 70 na América Latina. O Papa João Paulo II, no entanto, defendeu a manutenção da doutrina social oficial da Igreja, declarando, por exemplo, em 2002, sobre a ocupação da terra no Brasil: ""para alcançar a justiça social, é necessário tornar-se além da simples aplicação de esquemas ideológicos decorrentes da luta de classes, por exemplo, a ocupação da terra, que já condenei durante minha jornada pastoral de 1991."". A doutrina social da Igreja é, portanto, opôs à luta de classes a ideia de uma ""associação de classes"": ""o trabalho de um e o capital do outro devem ser associados um ao outro, uma vez que um não pode fazer nada sem a ajuda do outro"" diz a encíclica Quadragesimo anno (§58)  publicada em 1931 pelo Papa Pio XI. A aplicação desta ideia pode ser encontrada na promoção do corporativismo cristão ou da associação capital-trabalho defendida pelo gaullismo.


==== Luta de classes contra nação ====
Os nacionalistas acrescentam que o conceito de luta de classes enfraquece a ideia nação, dando prioridade a uma divisão social e econômica que abole o conceito de fronteira nacional. A luta de classes, de acordo com Karl Marx, imediatamente se refere a um quadro internacional, sendo o Manifesto Comunista publicado durante a onda das revoluções europeias de 1848. Assim, o nacionalismo vê na luta de classes um adversário que, ao mesmo tempo, divide a nação e a transcende criando solidariedade internacional. A oposição à luta de classes (colaboração de classes) foi um tema importante na propaganda de regimes e partidos fascistas e nazistas nas décadas de 1920 a 1940.


==== A questão de outras lutas políticas ====
O caso Dreyfus foi o grande caso da consciência do socialismo francês sobre o vínculo entre a luta política (neste caso, a defesa da justiça e dos direitos humanos) e a prioridade doutrinal absoluta dada à luta de classes. Alguns socialistas hesitaram antes de se comprometer com o capitão Alfred Dreyfus (oficial e burguês), julgando que, no caso de uma questão interna da burguesia, um engajamento traria a luta de classes. Outros socialistas, como Rosa Luxemburgo ou Jean Jaures (""certamente, podemos, sem contradizer nossos princípios e sem falhar a luta de classes, ouvir o choro da nossa piedade, podemos na luta revolucionária manter as entranhas humanas""), sentiram que a defesa de Dreyfus era compatível com a luta de classes.
Na sequência de Maio de 1968, alguns revolucionários criticaram os partidos marxistas ligados à luta de classes por terem dificuldades em integrar as ""novas lutas"": feminismo, regionalismo, antirracismo, ecologia, etc.


==== A questão da participação no poder e no reformismo ====
O conceito de luta de classes também é criticado por socialistas reformistas ansiosos por realizar reformas sociais à frente do ""Estado Burguês"". Este conceito, teoricamente, proíbe a colaboração dos ministros socialistas num governo burguês. Na França, isto levou o partido socialista SFIO recusar a participação no governo após a vitória do Cartel des Gauches em 1924 e do Bloc des gauches em 1932. Para resolver esta dificuldade doutrinária, o líder do SFIO, Leon Blum desenvolveu desde o do congresso do SFIO de Janeiro de 1926, a distinção entre o ""exercício do poder"" (que pode tolerar um certo grau de colaboração de classe, com o Parti républicain, radical et radical-socialiste em particular) e ""conquista do poder"" (resultante da luta de classes).


==== Crítica liberal ====
Os defensores do liberalismo econômico desafiam a concepção marxista da luta de classes. Eles podem negar, ou elaborar uma tipologia diferente, ou reduzir o seu alcance para o conflito sobre a distribuição do produto nacional (como Raymond Aron). Por outro lado, Karl Popper escreveu que Marx estava correto ""ao argumentar que a luta de classes e a união dos trabalhadores seriam os principais agentes"" da transformação do capitalismo.


=== Críticas sociológicas ===
Outro grande eixo de crítica do conceito de luta de classes reside na validade da definição das próprias classes sociais.
O estudo das populações está cada vez mais refinado em resposta à crescente diversificação de situações e comportamentos socioeconômicos (noção de segmentação da população).


==== A questão da homogeneidade das classes sociais ====
Alguns críticos questionaram, em particular, a homogeneidade de interesses e comportamentos existentes numa mesma classe social. Para esses críticos, a noção de luta de classes é ""simplista""  e, a divisão da sociedade entre trabalhadores e capitalistas não corresponde à realidade. Neste, as pessoas com as mesmas funções estão em competição e, portanto, têm alguns interesses conflitantes. Assim, observamos tensões protecionistas, que visam proteger empresas locais e, portanto, trabalhadores contra outros trabalhadores, chefes contra outros chefes; tensões durante greves entre grevistas e não-grevistas; tensões entre aqueles que estão integrados no sistema e aqueles que estão marginalizados (teoria insider-outsider). Segundo Pitirim Sorokin, ""qualquer grupo social organizado é sempre um corpo social estratificado. Não existe qualquer grupo social permanente que seja 'plano' e no qual todos os membros são iguais.""


==== A questão das classes médias ====
Outras críticas baseiam-se no surgimento na segunda metade do século XX de uma grande classe média e o declínio quantitativo da classe trabalhadora - na França em torno de 1970 - lançou um desafio sociológico-histórico para conceito de luta de classes. Para alguns, essas evoluções sociológicas invalidam o conceito de luta de classes, que deve ser substituído por outros modos de ação política (por exemplo, o reformismo sob a ação do Estado) ou outra forma de luta.
Para outros, o conceito de luta de classes permanece válido. A ideia da classe média foi levada em consideração por Karl Marx, que sentiu que esta estava destinado a equiparar-se ao proletariado. No século XX, o economista Paul Boccara coloca a existência de uma nova ""classe salarial"".

1728,"The Un-Americans (originalmente conhecidos como The Anti-Americans) (""Os Antiamericanos"") foi um grupo (""stable"") de wrestling profissional na World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), onde lutaram em 2002. O grupo era composto por lutadores canadenses e ingleses.


== História ==
O Un-Americans (""Não-Americanos"") se formaram no SmackDown, em junho de 2002 pelo canadense Lance Storm, que liderava um grupo similar na World Championship Wrestling, o Team Canada. Storm dizia que a World Wrestling Entertainment era xenófoba contra os canadenses, citando o Montreal Screwjob como exemplo. Christian (que era dupla de Storm desde a queda da aliança WCW/ECW) e Test, também canadenses, se uniram a Storm mais tarde naquele mês.
Para a formação do grupo, todos os membros haviam sido derrotados em lutas anteriores, graças à erros dos árbitros. Como diferença entre os Un-Americans e o Team Canada, o primeiro era antiamericano ao invés de pró-canadense. Assim, o emblema do grupo não era uma bandeira do Canadá, mas uma dos Estados Unidos de cabeça para baixo.
Em julho, o grupo começou rivalidades com lutadores como Rey Mysterio, Rikishi, Edge e Hollywood Hulk Hogan. Storm e Christian derrotaram Edge e Hogan, ganhando, assim, o WWE Tag Team Championship. Eles tiveram o auxílio de Chris Jericho, também canadense, que pediu a luta para Vince McMahon e acertou Edge com um dos cinturões. No entanto, Jericho não entrou formalmente para o grupo, apenas formando uma inimizade com Edge.
Eles foram transferidos do SmackDown para o Raw em 29 de julho e imediatamente começaram uma rivalidade com The Undertaker. Até aquela noite, o World Tag Team Championship era ativo apenas no SmackDown. Quando Storm e Christian foram transferidos para o Raw, os títulos também foram, forçando a criação de um título secundários de duplas. Eles começaram uma rivalidade com Booker T e Goldust, quem Storm e Christian derrotaram em uma luta pelos títulos em SummerSlam. Na mesma noite, Undertaker derrotou Test.
No fim de agosto e início de setembro, os Un-Americans tentaram queimar a bandeira dos Estados Unidos diversas vezes, mas foram impedidos por Booker T, Goldust, Kane e Bradshaw. Na metade de setembro, o inglês William Regal se juntou ao grupo. No Unforgiven, os Un-Americans foram derrotados por Booker T, Goldust, Kane e Bubba Ray Dudley.
Storm e Christian perderam os títulos de duplas em 23 de setembro, quando foram derrotados por Kane e The Hurricane. Após a luta, Storm e Christian culparam o outro pela derrota. Uma semana depois, Storm e Christian foram derrotados em lutas individuais por Randy Orton, e Test e Regal perderam uma luta de duplas. O quarteto se dividiu e se separou.
Regal e Storm continuaram uma dupla, reconquistando os títulos de duplas duas vezes. Test passou a ter Stacy Keibler como manager, se tornando um mocinho. Christian formou uma dupla com Chris Jericho. Atualmente, Regal e Christian ainda trabalham para a WWE. Lance Storm se aposentou e Test faleceu devido a um problema com drogas em 2009.
